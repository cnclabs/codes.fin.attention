item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are the product of the may merger of panamsat international and the galaxy business of hughes communications  inc  a subsidiary of hughes electronics  into a new publicly held company  which retained the panamsat name 
hughes electronics  a wholly owned subsidiary of general motors corporation gm  indirectly owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
on october   gm  hughes electronics and echostar communications corporation echostar  announced the signing of definitive agreements that provided for the split off of hughes electronics from gm and the subsequent merger of the hughes electronics business with echostar the echostar transaction 
on december   the parties announced the termination of the agreements stating that the echostar transaction could not be completed within the time allowed due to regulatory opposition 
under terms of the settlement  echostar was released from its contingent obligation to purchase the panamsat business and hughes electronics retained its ownership position in panamsat corporation 
critical accounting policies we prepare the consolidated financial statements of panamsat in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates  actual results reported in future periods may be affected by changes in those estimates 
the following represent what panamsat believes are the critical accounting policies that require the most significant management estimates and judgments receivables including net investment in sales type leases a significant amount of management estimate and judgment is required in determining the amount of reserves required for the potential non collectability of receivables 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
if collectability of the receivable is not reasonably assured at the time services are performed  the company does not initially record the revenue  but rather records an allowance for customer credits to offset the receivable 
if there is a change in the customer s financial status or the receivable is collected  revenue is recorded at that time 
while such credit losses described above have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will experience the same credit loss rates that we have estimated or historically experienced 
as such  additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections 
since our long term receivables and net investment in sales type leases relate to significant long term contracts which are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our long term receivables or net investment in sales type leases and our future operating results 
additionally  if a satellite s useful life is shortened  and a sales type lease is recorded on that satellite  we would write off the portion of the sales type lease receivable which is uncollectable as a result 
as of december  and  we had aggregate gross receivables of million and million  respectively  related to sales type lease  operating lease and other long term receivables 
with respect to these amounts  we maintained an aggregate allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately million and million in and  respectively  including allowances for customer credits see deferred charges and other assets and accounts receivable within note to the company s consolidated financial statements and note operating leases and net investment in sales type leases to the company s consolidated financial statements 
evaluation of satellites and other long lived assets for impairment and satellite insurance coverage the company periodically evaluates potential impairment loss relating to its satellites and other long lived assets  when a change in circumstances occurs  by assessing whether the carrying amount of these assets can be recovered over their remaining lives through undiscounted future expected cash flows generated by those assets excluding interest charges 
if the undiscounted future cash flows were less than the carrying value of the long lived asset  an impairment charge would be recorded 
the impairment charge would be measured as the excess of the carrying value of the long lived asset over the present value of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
losses on long lived assets to be disposed of are determined in a similar manner except that fair values are reduced for the cost of disposal 
changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period 
in the event a portion of a satellite was rendered inoperative and or incapable of performing its intended function  the company would apply the concepts of fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
this supersedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  in the determination of whether an impairment loss had occurred 
if an impairment loss was indicated  such amount would be recognized in the period of occurrence  net of any insurance proceeds to be received so long as such amounts are determinable and receipt is probable 
if no impairment loss was indicated in accordance with sfas and the company received insurance proceeds  the proceeds would offset the carrying value of the satellite 
in the event that the insurance proceeds received exceeded the carrying value of the satellite  the excess of the proceeds over the carrying value of the satellite would be recognized in the income statement 
in the event a portion of a satellite was rendered inoperative and or incapable of performing its intended function and the satellite was not insured  the company would apply the concepts of sfas in the determination of whether an impairment loss had occurred 
in the event an impairment loss had occurred  such amount would be recognized in the period of occurrence 
if no impairment loss was required as calculated under sfas  the company would make a determination  based on the facts and circumstances at the time of occurrence  if disclosure of the event in the accompanying notes is required 
certain losses of a satellite may not be covered by launch or in orbit insurance policies 
some of our satellites are covered by insurance policies that are subject to significant health related exclusions and deductibles related to specific components identified by the insurers as the most likely to fail and some of our satellites are uninsured see risks relating to our business our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if we were to suffer a loss that is not adequately covered by insurance 
valuation of goodwill panamsat evaluates the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis  and when events and circumstances warrant such a review in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which is described in note and note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
requires the use of fair value in determining the amount of impairment  if any  for recorded goodwill 
in conjunction with the company s goodwill impairment assessments  the company utilized an independent valuation expert to assist the company in assessing the fair value of its reporting unit using a discounted cash flow approach 
no charge was required as a result of these impairment assessments 
changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period 
if such an impairment loss results from future impairment tests  the loss will be recorded as a pre tax charge to operating income 
the amount of any loss resulting from future impairment tests could be material to panamsat s results of operations 
restructuring reserves upon approval of a restructuring plan by management  the company may be required to record certain restructuring reserves 
prior to the adoption of sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas on january   the company accounted for its restructuring charges in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  whereas  under eitf issue no 
 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the company s restructuring reserves as of december  were all recorded pursuant to eitf these reserves relate primarily to future lease costs for unused leased facilities and severance related costs  including employee compensation and employee benefits  outplacement services and legal and consulting expenses associated with reductions in workforce 
the liabilities recorded related to the severance costs are primarily short term  as these liabilities will be paid within one year 
the liabilities related to future lease costs are primarily long term as the related lease payments will be made over the remaining lease terms  a majority of which are greater than one year 
additionally  in conjunction with the company s teleport consolidation plan  which was approved in january  certain additional restructuring charges will be recorded during and  as the related liabilities are incurred 
inherent in the estimation of these restructuring costs are assessments related to the most likely expected outcome of the significant actions to accomplish the restructuring 
changing business conditions may affect the assumptions related to the timing and extent of facility closure activities 
we review the status of restructuring activities on a quarterly basis and  if appropriate  record changes based on updated estimates 
depreciable satellite lives the estimated useful lives of the company s satellites are based upon the lower of the satellite s design life or the estimated life of the satellite as determined by an engineering analysis performed during initial in orbit testing 
as the telecommunications industry is subject to rapid technological change and the company s satellites have been subject to certain health related anomalies  the company may be required to revise the estimated useful lives of its satellites and communications equipment or to adjust their carrying amounts 
accordingly  the estimated useful lives of the company s satellites are periodically reviewed using current engineering data 
if a significant change in the estimated useful lives of our satellites is identified  the company accounts for the effects of such changes on depreciation expense on a prospective basis 
reductions in the estimated useful lives of our satellites would result in additional depreciation expense in future periods 
if the reduction in the estimated useful life of a satellite results in undiscounted future cash flows for the satellite which are less than the carrying value of the satellite  an impairment charge would be recorded 
deferred taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
panamsat regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance in order to reduce the company s deferred tax assets based on an evaluation of the amount of deferred tax assets that management believes are more likely than not to be ultimately realized in the foreseeable future 
management establishes this valuation allowance based upon historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
if we continue to operate at a loss for tax purposes or are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to establish a valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our operating results 
we currently operate under a federal income tax sharing arrangement with hughes electronics  our parent corporation 
in accordance with such arrangement  we provide for current and deferred income taxes as if we were the common parent of an affiliated group that is not included in the consolidated federal income tax return that includes hughes electronics 
at december   our balance sheet reflected a deferred tax asset in the amount of million attributable to the future benefit from the utilization of certain net operating tax loss carryforwards  alternative minimum tax credits and foreign tax credits 
such tax sharing arrangement with hughes electronics does not provide for the payment by hughes electronics for any benefit relating to any of our then remaining net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes once we are no longer included in the same affiliated group with hughes electronics see certain relationships and related transactions transactions with hughes electronics and its affiliates tax sharing arrangement

total revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from million for the same period in this decrease is primarily the result of million of new sales type lease revenue recorded during the year ended december   for which there was no comparable revenue during the year ended december  virtually all of the revenues from sales type lease agreements are recognized at service commencement  whereas revenues from operating lease agreements are recognized monthly over the term of the agreement 
operating lease revenues from video services  decreased by to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in this decrease was primarily due to lower net new business related to program distribution and dth video revenues of million  as well as lower revenues recorded in as a result of customer credit issues of million 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in occasional video services revenues of million  which primarily related to the fifa world cup  and higher termination fee revenues of million recorded during the year ended december  operating lease revenues from network services were million for the year ended december   as compared to million recorded for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily attributable to reduced revenues recorded as a result of customer credit issues of million and lower internet related revenues of million  partially offset by million of additional network services revenues recorded during the year ended december  revenues from operating leases of transponders  satellite services and other decreased million  or  to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december   from million  or  of total revenues  for the same period in this decrease was primarily due to lower program distribution and dth video revenues  partially offset by an increase in occasional video services revenue which was largely attributable to the fifa world cup 
revenues from outright sales and sales type leases were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily the result of the million of new sales type lease revenue recorded during the year ended december  which was discussed above 
included within total sales and sales type lease revenue for the years ended december  and was interest income related to sales type leases of million and million  respectively 
cost of outright sales and sales type leases of transponders 
the company recorded million of costs of sales type leases of transponders for the year ended december  for which there was no comparable transaction in direct operating costs 
direct operating costs decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million during the same period in the decrease in direct operating costs was primarily related to the operational streamlining that has occurred over the last year including lower webcast services previously called net costs of million and lower consulting and professional fees of million 
in addition  the company recorded additional costs of million in as compared to as a result of the company s revenue share with the galaxy viii i insurers 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative costs decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million during the same period in the decrease was primarily due to decreased expenses related to webcast services of million  reduced advertising and promotional costs of million  decreased bad debt expense of million  and lower legal and professional costs of million 
facilities restructuring and severance costs 
facilities restructuring and severance costs increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million in the costs are primarily attributable to the restructuring of certain of the company s facilities 
the costs represent severance charges related to the company s expense reduction and webcast services restructuring plan which commenced in the third quarter of see note to the company s consolidated financial statements  facilities restructuring and severance costs 
gain on insurance claims 
during the year ended december   the company recorded a gain of approximately million related to the pas insurance claim  which reflects the net proceeds agreed to by the insurers of million less the net book value of the pas satellite  including incentive obligations 
see liquidity and capital resources insurance settlements below 
there was no comparable transaction during loss on conversion of sales type leases 
on march   the company entered into an agreement with one of its customers regarding the revision of the customer s sales type lease agreements as well as certain other trade receivables 
this agreement resulted in the termination of the customer s sales type leases and the establishment of new operating leases in their place 
as a result  the company recorded a non cash charge in the year ended december  of million 
there was no comparable transaction in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million during the same period in this decrease is primarily due to the elimination of goodwill amortization as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas during of approximately million  lower depreciation related to galaxy viii i of million which was fully depreciated in july of  and lower depreciation expense recorded in of million as a result of the write off of our pas satellite during the first quarter of see gain on insurance claims above 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in non satellite depreciation of million and additional depreciation expense of million related to three satellites placed in service during and income from operations 
income from operations increased million  or  to million for year ended december  from million during the same period in excluding million related to the sales type lease recorded during the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the company s operational streamlining that has occurred over the last year  the elimination of goodwill amortization as a result of the adoption of sfas see recent accounting pronouncements below during the first quarter of  and several significant transactions  which were recorded during the year ended december  these significant transactions included the recording of a million gain in relation to the settlement of the pas insurance claim  the recording of additional net facilities restructuring and severance charges of million related to several of the company s us locations  and the recording of a million loss on the conversion of several sales type leases to operating leases by one of the company s customers 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million during the same period in interest expense  net was recorded net of capitalized interest of million and million during and  respectively  and net of interest income of million and million during and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense  net was primarily attributable to higher interest expense related to the new debt acquired as a result of the refinancing partially offset by higher capitalized interest of million 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million during the same period in the increase in income tax expense for the twelve months ended december   was primarily due to an increase of million in income before income taxes and extraordinary item 
the reduction in the company s effective income tax rate from in to in was primarily a result of the elimination of goodwill amortization due to the adoption of sfas extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt 
on february   the company completed its refinancing and repaid the billion indebtedness owed under the term loan to hughes electronics see liquidity and capital resources long term debt below 
in conjunction with this repayment  the company was required to write off the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs of approximately million related to the hughes electronics term loan  net of related income taxes of million 
this million charge was recorded within the company s consolidated income statement for the twelve months ended december  as an extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt 
there was no comparable transaction in upon adoption of the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas on january   the company will be required to reclassify this loss on extinguishment of debt to other expense  as it does not meet the new requirements for classification as an extraordinary item in accordance with sfas see recent accounting pronouncements below 
compared to revenues 
total revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from  million for the same period in this decrease was primarily due to million of new outright sales and sales type lease revenues recorded during the year ended december  compared to million of new sales type lease revenues recorded during the same period in virtually all of the revenues from outright sales and sales type lease agreements are recognized at service commencement  whereas revenues from operating lease agreements are recognized monthly over the term of the agreement 
video services revenues  excluding revenues from new sales type lease activity  increased by to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in this increase was primarily due to new dth services that commenced late in the third quarter of and generated a full year of revenue in network services revenues  excluding new outright sales  increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in  primarily due to growth in internet related services 
revenues from operating leases of transponders  satellite services and other increased million  or  to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december   from million  or  of total revenues  for the same period in the increase was primarily due to increased dth and internet related services during revenues for the year ended december   excluding new sales and sales type leases  increased by million  or  to million compared to million during the same period in revenues from outright sales and sales type leases were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is attributable to the decrease in new outright sales and sales type lease transactions in as compared to which was discussed above 
included within total sales and sales type lease revenue for the years ended december  and was interest income related to sales type leases of million and million  respectively 
cost of outright sales and sales type leases of transponders 
the company recorded million of costs of sales type leases of transponders for the year ended december  compared to million during the same period in the decrease in was primarily due to the greater number of outright sale and sales type lease agreements recorded in than in direct operating costs 
direct operating costs increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million during the same period in the increase in direct operating costs was primarily related to increased costs related to additional headcount to support the company s services of million  increased costs related to continued fleet expansion of million and increased costs related to the development of the company s net initiative now called webcast services of million  offset partially by lower insurance costs of million resulting from additional self insured satellites and lower consulting and third party costs during as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative costs increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million during the same period in the increase was primarily due to increased bad debt expense of million  increased expenses related to the development of the webcast services initiative of million and increased costs related to additional headcount to support the company s services of million  offset partially by reduced advertising and promotions costs of million and lower legal and consulting costs of million 
facilities restructuring and severance costs 
the company recorded severance costs of million for the year ended december  for which there were no comparable costs during the same period in these costs were related to the company s expense reduction and net restructuring plan that began in the third quarter of and were primarily comprised of employee compensation and employee benefits  outplacement services and legal and consulting expenses associated with the reduction in workforce of employees 
also included in these costs was approximately million that relates to costs associated with the resignation of the former chief executive officer of panamsat in august these severance costs were primarily related to employee compensation and employee benefits 
approximately million of the million of total severance costs were paid during and approximately million were recorded within accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at december  substantially all of the remaining accrued severance costs at december  are expected to be paid during depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million during the same period in  due primarily to accelerated depreciation on the galaxy viii i satellite  depreciation expense associated with two new satellites placed into service in  and being the first full year of depreciation expense associated with four new satellites that were placed into service in income from operations 
income from operations decreased million  or  to million for year ended december  from million during the same period in the decrease was primarily due to the gross profit associated with million of new outright sales and sales type lease agreements that were recorded in compared to the gross profit associated with million related to a new sales type lease agreement that was recorded in also contributing to the decrease in income from operations were increased direct operating and selling  general and administrative costs and increased depreciation expense for the year ended december  compared to the same period in interest expense  net 
interest expense  net decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million during the same period in interest expense  net was recorded net of capitalized interest of million and million during and  respectively and net of interest income of million and million during and  respectively 
the decrease was due primarily to decreased interest expense as a result of lower interest rates associated with the company s variable rate borrowings and higher interest income as a result of a higher cash balance in than in these items were partially offset by a reduction in capitalized interest as a result of a lower amount of satellite construction in progress during than in income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million during the same period in the decrease in income tax expense for the twelve months ended december   was due to decreased income from operations which resulted in a decrease in taxable income of million for the year ended december   as well as a decrease in the company s effective tax rate from in to in as a result of the greater beneficial effects of the foreign sales corporation replacement legislation known as the exclusion for extraterritorial income 
goodwill on january   the company adopted sfas among other things  sfas provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives not be amortized  but rather be tested for impairment annually or when a change in circumstances occurs 
panamsat has determined that  for such impairment testing  the company has only one reporting unit  which is at the enterprise level 
in the quarter ended june   the company completed its transitional assessment of the recoverability of its goodwill and determined that no impairment charge was required 
in the third quarter of  panamsat disclosed that it will perform its annual impairment test for its reporting unit during the fourth quarter of each year  beginning with the fourth quarter of in conjunction with this annual impairment test  the company utilized an independent valuation expert to assist the company in assessing the fair value of the reporting unit 
this independent valuation  which was prepared utilizing a discounted cash flow approach  resulted in a fair value for the reporting unit which exceeded the carrying value of the company s goodwill and  as such  no impairment charge was required 
if an impairment loss results from future impairment tests  the loss will be recorded as a pre tax charge to operating income 
the amount of any loss resulting from future impairment tests could be material to panamsat s results of operations 
the adoption of sfas resulted in the elimination of goodwill amortization beginning january  as of december   the company had goodwill of approximately billion and no other intangible assets 
prior to the adoption of sfas  our annual goodwill amortization was approximately million 
net income and earnings per share for the years ended december    and adjusted to exclude amortization expense related to goodwill which is no longer amortized  are as follows year ending december  income before extraordinary item reported income before extraordinary item    goodwill amortization   adjusted income before extraordinary item    net income reported net income    goodwill amortization   adjusted net income    earnings per share before extraordinary item basic and diluted reported earnings per share before extraordinary item basic and diluted goodwill amortization per share adjusted earnings per share before extraordinary item basic and diluted net income per share basic and diluted reported net income per share basic and diluted goodwill amortization per share adjusted net income per share basic and diluted significant accounting policies results of operations the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition as a leading global facilities based provider of video  broadcasting and network services through satellites  we derive our revenue primarily from our video and network services 
our video services generate the majority of our revenues 
we expect video services to continue to generate the majority of our revenues 
for  and we derived our revenues from the following service areas year ended december services video services network services other services total we generally enter into operating lease contracts with customers to provide satellite transponders and transponder capacity and  in certain cases  earth station and teleport facility services 
on occasion  we have also entered into outright sales and sales type lease contracts with our customers 
the length of these contracts typically ranges from one year to the useful life of the satellite which can be up to years 
almost all of our contracts are denominated in us dollars 
operating leases and short term agreements operating leases are contracts to provide satellite capacity and related services typically for periods of one to years 
long term operating leases provide us with a stable and predictable source of revenue 
short term leases and occasional services fill spot market demand 
we generally recognize revenues from operating leases on a straight line basis over the lease term  unless collectability is not reasonably assured 
differences between operating lease payments received and revenues recognized are deferred as  or amortized from  operating lease receivables 
revenues for occasional services are recognized as services are performed and billed 
except for certain deposits  the company is not obligated to refund operating lease payments previously made 
operating lease  satellite services and other revenues for the years ended december    and represented  and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues for those periods 
the lower percentage of consolidated revenue in was due primarily to the large amount of sales type leases and outright sales that we recorded during sales type leases lease contracts qualifying for capital lease treatment typically based  among other factors  on the term of the lease are accounted for as sales type leases 
sales type leases are similar to operating leases except that under sales type leases  we recognize as revenue at the inception of the lease the net present value of the future minimum lease payments  but we continue to receive cash payments from the lessee throughout the term of the lease 
in addition  during the life of the lease  we recognize as revenue the portion of each periodic lease payment deemed to be attributable to interest income 
the principal difference between a sales type lease and an operating lease is when we recognize the revenue  but not when we receive the cash 
we have entered into sales type leases at the request of customers seeking to obtain capital lease treatment of the lease agreement 
as of december  we had sales type lease arrangements covering transponders  in mhz equivalents  on our satellites currently in orbit 
typically  our long term leases qualify as sales type leases under the relevant accounting standards because the terms of the leases are equal to or more of the estimated economic life of the related satellite 
during the years ended december    and  we recorded revenue of  million and million  respectively  related to new sales type leases 
we do not expect to enter into a significant amount of sales type leases in the future  although this result may change in response to future customer requests 
outright sales contracts under an outright sales contract  we sell all rights and title to a transponder to a customer  which in turn pays us the full amount of the sale price in cash at the commencement of the contract 
at that time  we recognize the sale amount as revenue 
we have sold the rights to transponders  in mhz equivalents  on our satellites currently in orbit 
in  outright sales were million  or approximately of our revenues 
we did not enter into any outright sales during the years ended december  or  and we expect outright sales of transponder capacity to occur infrequently in the future  as requested by our customers 
tt c services and other services we provide tt c services for satellites owned by other satellite operators and also in connection with outright sales contracts 
revenues from tt c service agreements represented approximately  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
tt c agreements entered into in connection with our lease contracts are typically for the period of the related lease agreement 
tt c services provided in connection with outright sales contracts are typically for the term of the sale contract and require the customer to pay a monthly service fee 
for a significant portion of our customer lease agreements  we perform tt c services for the customer but the fees for such services are included in the customer s monthly lease payment 
our other services include in orbit backup service  which is backup transponder capacity that we reserve for certain customers on agreed terms 
we recognize revenues for in orbit protection services over the term of the related agreement 
revenues from in orbit protection for  and were approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues 
contracted backlog contracted backlog represents expected future cash payments to be received from customers under executed operating leases or sales type leases see note to the company s consolidated financial statements  operating leases and net investment in sales type leases 
contracted backlog is attributable to both satellites currently in orbit and those planned for future launch 
our contracted backlog for future services at december    and was billion  billion and billion  respectively 
of the billion of contracted backlog at december   we expect to realize approximately million as revenue in included in contracted backlog at december  was approximately billion related to satellites to be launched 
see liquidity and capital resources contracted backlog for future services 
at december   our contracted backlog was comprised of the following contracted backlog at category december  in billions video services network services other total geographic distribution of revenues almost all of our contracts are denominated in us dollars 
for the years ended december   and we derived our revenues from operations in the following regions  shown in percentages year ended year ended year ended december  december  december  region united states latin america asia other total costs and expenses in general  our costs and expenses are largely fixed in nature  providing us with the ability to recognize significant incremental revenues without significant incremental costs once we have launched a satellite 
our costs and expenses include direct operating costs  selling  general and administrative costs  depreciation and amortization  and costs associated with the outright sale or sales type lease 
direct operating costs are primarily comprised of costs to operate and maintain our satellites such as engineering and operations costs  in orbit insurance costs and third party charges generally associated with the provision of special events and occasional services 
selling  general and administrative costs primarily consist of sales and marketing expenses  salaries and benefits  and corporate general and administrative expenses 
at the inception of an outright sale or a sales type lease  the cost basis of the transponder and related insurance is charged to cost of the outright sale or sales type lease 
we have reduced our operating cost structure in order to improve our operating efficiency 
since july  we have streamlined our operations  rationalized headcount and reduced general operating expenses 
for the year ended december   our direct operating costs and selling  general and administrative expenses decreased a combined million to million as compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to our continued focus on operational efficiencies 
satellite deployment plan and planned satellites satellite deployment plan our construction and launch strategy is to replace existing satellites as they approach the end of their useful lives or encounter other reductions or risks to their useful lives with new satellites to meet customer needs 
since the fourth quarter of  we have launched seven satellites  in part to replace existing satellites and in part to serve markets in which we believe there is or will be a significant demand for additional transponders 
all of these seven satellites have significant contracted backlog 
in addition  we intend to selectively expand our global coverage  capacity and service offerings by deploying satellites into new orbital locations where we perceive sufficient customer demand and market opportunities 
in many cases  a retired satellite may be capable of continuing to offer services beyond the time that its replacement is deployed 
in these cases  we typically seek to co locate the older satellite with the new satellite or to move the older satellite to an interim location  in each case subject to applicable us and foreign regulatory approvals 
we generally enter into launch contracts for the launch of both specified and unspecified future satellites 
for example  we may enter into a contract with a launch provider for the launch of multiple satellites  though the identity of all such satellites may not be determined at the time we enter into the contract 
we believe that entering into multi launch contracts in this manner gives us better terms and provides us with a hedge against the potential of increasing launch prices 
each of our launch contracts provides that we may terminate the contract at our option  subject to our payment of a specified termination fee that increases in magnitude as the applicable launch date approaches 
in addition  in the event of the failure of any launch  we may exercise the right to obtain a replacement launch within a specified period 
the normal delivery time for the construction of a satellite is approximately months 
purchase agreements generally require us to pay the majority of the total contract price for each satellite during the period of the satellite s construction  with the remainder of the contract price payable to the manufacturer in the form of incentive payments based on orbital performance over the design life of the satellite following launch 
the contracts also provide for price reductions or payments by the manufacturer in the event of late delivery due to the manufacturer s fault 
the contracts contain provisions that would enable us to terminate them with or without cause 
if terminated without cause  we would be subject to substantial termination liabilities that escalate with the passage of time 
if terminated for cause including if delivery is late by a specified period of months  we would be entitled to recover any payments we made under the contract and to certain additional damages as specified in the contract 
we seek competitive bids from satellite manufacturers before entering into construction contracts 
notwithstanding the fairly small number of satellite manufacturers worldwide  we believe that the satellite production industry is highly competitive  thereby providing us with favorable pricing and alternative sources of supply 
planned satellites we expect to launch up to four satellites by the end of  including galaxy xii 
this c band satellite is being constructed by orbital sciences corporation orbital sciences and is designed to cover the united states 
scheduled to be launched in the second quarter of  we expect this satellite to be co located with our sbs satellite 
galaxy xiii horizons i satellite 
in august  we entered into a strategic relationship with jsat international inc jsat  a japanese satellite services provider  to expand digital services in north america 
through this relationship  called horizons  we and jsat will jointly develop and market ku band video  data and internet satellite services and will share revenues on a basis for the ku band services 
the jointly owned horizons llc will own the ku band payload for a new boeing hp satellite referred to as galaxy xiii horizons i that is scheduled for launch in mid we will separately own  develop and market the c band capacity on this new satellite as part of our galaxy cable neighborhood 
the c band payload will replace the galaxy ix satellite in our domestic us fleet 
galaxy ix will become the us galaxy fleet backup satellite 
in addition to galaxy xii  we have two c band satellites under construction by orbital sciences for united states coverage 
these satellites were purchased together  in volume  to take advantage of available discounts 
we are currently scheduled to launch the second orbital sciences satellite to replace galaxy v prior to the end of its useful life in and the third orbital sciences satellite to replace galaxy ir prior to the end of its useful life in at december   we had spent approximately million on the four satellites that we plan to launch by the end of  and we are under contract to spend an additional million on these satellites for construction and launch  which is net of approximately million of costs to be paid by jsat in conjunction with our horizons strategic relationship 
these amounts do not include million of satellite launch payments originally paid for the galaxy viii ir launch that have been deferred to an unspecified future launch  million of costs paid for another future launch  and approximately million of contractual obligations for other unspecified launches 
they also do not include amounts paid to the manufacturer for the construction of galaxy viii ir  which contract was terminated see liquidity and capital resources receivable from satellite manufacturer above 
in december  we terminated one of our noncontingent agreements with orbital sciences corporation for the construction of a ka band satellite 
such termination was in accordance with the company s ka band strategy which included relinquishing all but one of our us ka band orbital locations  which would have required systems to be placed in service before  and filing for new authorizations in australia 
this filing and return of authorizations allows the company more time to place ka band satellites in service 
we are exploring the business case for use of the remaining ka band satellite under construction by orbital sciences corporation and may conclude that we will not pursue the construction of this satellite to completion 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million at december  during the year ended december  the company received million as a result of the settlement of the pas insurance claim see insurance settlements below and invested approximately million in commercial paper see short term investments below 
short term investments at december   we had short term investments of million  for which there was no comparable balance as of december  the short term investments primarily consist of commercial paper with original maturities of up to nine months 
all of the short term investments held as of december  have remaining maturities of four months or less 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the company has classified these short term investments as available for sale 
these securities are carried at estimated fair market value 
the aggregate unrealized gains and losses related to these investments  net of taxes  are reflected as a part of other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
long term debt at december   the company had total debt outstanding of billion  including current maturities of million related to the company s notes due in the million notes matured on january  and were repaid in full  plus accrued interest of million  from available cash 
in february  the company entered into a credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to billion the senior secured credit facility and completed an million private placement debt offering pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended the senior notes 
we refer to these transactions as the refinancing 
our net proceeds from the senior notes and borrowings of billion under the senior secured credit facility were approximately billion in the aggregate  after underwriting fees and other expenses of the transactions 
we used billion of the proceeds from the refinancing to repay in full the indebtedness owed under the term loan to hughes electronics 
the senior secured credit facility is comprised of a million revolving credit facility  which is presently undrawn and will terminate on december  the revolving facility  a million term loan a facility  which matures on december  the term a facility  and a million term loan b facility which matures on december  the term b facility 
principal payments under the term a facility and term b facility are due in varying amounts described below commencing in until their respective maturity dates 
currently  the revolving facility and the term a facility bear interest at libor plus  although these interest rates are subject to adjustment based on the company s total leverage ratio 
the term b facility bears interest at libor plus 
in addition  the company is required to pay to the lenders under the revolving facility a commitment fee in respect of the unused commitments at a rate that is subject to adjustment based on the company s total leverage ratio 
as of december   this commitment fee rate was per year  and the company had outstanding letters of credit totaling million  which reduced our ability to borrow against the revolving facility by such amount 
at december   the applicable interest rate on the term a facility was  the applicable interest rate on the term b facility was  and the unused commitment fee for the period from february  through december  was approximately million 
obligations under the senior secured credit facility are  or will be  as the case may be  unconditionally guaranteed by each of our existing and subsequently acquired or organized domestic and  to the extent no adverse tax consequences would result therefrom  foreign restricted subsidiaries 
in addition  such obligations are equally and ratably secured by perfected first priority security interests in  and mortgages on  substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of the company and its subsidiaries  including its satellites 
in accordance with the agreement governing the senior secured credit facility  the company entered into an interest rate hedge agreement for of the outstanding borrowings under the senior secured credit facility during the third quarter of this interest rate hedge is designated as a cash flow hedge of the company s variable rate term b facility 
in relation to this hedge agreement  the company exchanged its floating rate obligation on million of its term b facility for a fixed rate payment obligation of on million through august  the notional amount of the interest rate hedge agreement matches the repayment schedule of the term b facility though the maturity date of the interest rate hedge 
during the year ended december   no ineffectiveness was recognized in the statement of operations on this hedge 
in the unlikely event that the counter party  deutsche bank  fails to meet the terms of the interest rate hedge agreement  the company s exposure is limited to the interest rate differential on the notional amount at each quarterly settlement period over the life of the agreements 
the company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counter party 
amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income oci related to this cash flow hedge are reclassified into earnings as interest is accrued on the hedged transaction 
the amount accumulated in oci will fluctuate based on the change in the fair value of the derivative at each reporting period  net of applicable deferred income taxes 
the fair value of the interest rate hedge agreement is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive to terminate the agreement at the reporting date  taking into account current interest rates  the market expectation for future interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the company 
the fair value of the outstanding interest rate hedge agreement as of december   based upon quoted market prices from the counter party  reflected a hedge liability of approximately million 
the revolving facility will terminate on december  the term a facility will mature on december  and amortizes in quarterly installments during each year as follows year ending december  amount the term b facility will mature on december  and amortizes in quarterly installments in annual amounts equal to of the term b facility during each of the third through sixth years of such facility  with the balance payable in quarterly installments during the seventh year of such facility 
the senior notes bear interest at an annual rate of  subject to increases pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the issuance of the senior notes the registration rights agreement  as described below 
the senior notes require interest payments to be made semi annually  mature in  are unsecured  and are guaranteed  on a full and unconditional and joint and several basis  by all of the company s domestic owned subsidiaries 
pursuant to the registration rights agreement  on april  the company initiated the filing of a registration statement on form s with the sec in relation to an exchange of the senior notes for an equal amount of new notes registered under the securities act and otherwise with substantially identical terms 
following the effectiveness of the form s registration statement in november these registered notes were issued in exchange for all of the company s existing senior notes in an exchange offer 
also  pursuant to the registration rights agreement  the company paid additional interest on the senior notes for the period between august  and november  the obligation to pay additional interest ended on november   the day before the sec declared the company s exchange offer registration statement on form s effective 
the sec previously had delayed the effectiveness of such registration statement until the review process for the registration statement on form s of hec holdings  inc  an affiliate of hughes electronics was completed 
the additional interest was basis points for the period from august  through october  and basis points for the period from october  through november  during the year ended december   the company paid additional interest of million in relation to the delayed effectiveness of this registration statement 
on july   the company completed the transfer of certain assets and liabilities from certain of its subsidiary guarantors to panamsat corporation 
as a result of such transfers  the remaining subsidiary guarantors  individually and in the aggregate  represent less than of the company s consolidated total assets  total liabilities  revenues  stockholders equity  income from continuing operations before income taxes and cash flows from operating activities  and such subsidiaries have no independent assets or operations determined in accordance with the criteria established for parent companies in the sec s regulation s x  rule h 
all subsidiary guarantors and all subsidiaries of the company  other than the subsidiary guarantors  are minor as defined in the sec s regulation s x  rule h 
accordingly  condensed consolidating financial information for the company and its subsidiaries within the notes to the company s consolidating financial statements is not presented 
the indenture governing the senior notes and the agreement governing the senior secured credit facility contain various covenants which impose significant restrictions on our business 
these covenants limit our ability to  among other things incur or guarantee additional indebtedness  make restricted payments  including dividends  create or permit to exist certain liens  enter into business combinations and asset sale transactions  make investments and enter into transactions with affiliates and enter into new businesses 
the senior secured credit facility also limits the company s ability to sell certain assets of the company 
in conjunction with the refinancing  the company was required to write off the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs of approximately million related to the hughes electronics term loan  net of related income taxes of million 
this million charge was recorded within the company s consolidated income statement for the three months ended march  as an extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt 
upon adoption of the provisions of sfas on january   the company will be required to reclassify this loss on extinguishment of debt to other expense  as it does not meet the new requirements for classification as an extraordinary item in accordance with sfas see recent accounting pronouncements below 
the company issued five  seven  ten and thirty year fixed rate notes totaling million in january the outstanding principal balances  interest rates and maturity dates for these notes as of december  were million at due  million at due  million at due and million at due  respectively 
principal on the notes is payable at maturity  while interest is payable semi annually 
in connection with the refinancing  these notes have been ratably secured by substantially all of our assets on a pari passu basis with the security interests covering our obligations under the senior secured credit facility 
the million notes matured on january  and were repaid in full  plus accrued interest of million  from available cash 
we maintained a multi year revolving credit facility the pre existing revolver and a commercial paper program the commercial paper program that provided for aggregate short term and long term borrowings of million 
on february   we obtained a new million revolving credit facility in connection with the refinancing described above and we terminated the pre existing revolver 
borrowings under the pre existing revolver and the commercial paper program bore interest at a rate equal to libor plus a spread based on our credit rating 
no amounts were outstanding under the pre existing revolver or the commercial paper program at the date of their termination in february the company had million principal amount outstanding under notes assumed in connection with our exercise in july of an early buy out opportunity for certain transponders under a sale leaseback transaction relating to our galaxy iiir satellite the galaxy iiir notes as of december  the galaxy iiir notes  which bore interest at libor plus  matured on january  and were repaid in full plus accrued interest on that date from available cash 
contracted backlog for future services due to events in the telecommunications industry and general economic conditions in certain parts of the world  we have reviewed our backlog for our top customers to identify risks to our business related to these events and conditions 
of our billion backlog as of december   approximately billion  or related to our top customers 
having conducted both quantitative and qualitative analyses  we concluded that six of our top customers  including our largest customer  directv latin america  have a risk of future non performance of their contractual obligations to us 
these six customers are meeting substantially all of their obligations at the present time and are paying in a manner consistent with past experience 
they represented approximately billion of our backlog as of december  directv latin america announced in january that it has initiated discussions with certain programmers  suppliers  lenders  and business associates  including panamsat  to reduce excessive fixed costs and a substantial debt burden 
in that announcement  directv latin america indicated that if those discussions are not successful in the near future  they may file for a restructuring under chapter of the us bankruptcy law 
at december   directv latin america represented approximately million  or of our total backlog  and million  or of our expected revenues 
the smallest of these six customers represented approximately million  or of our total backlog  and million  or of our expected revenues 
if directv latin america  one of the other larger affected customers  or a group of these customers becomes unable to perform some or all of their obligations to us  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
receivable from satellite manufacturer our customer for all of the capacity on the galaxy viii ir satellite has exercised its pre launch right to terminate its lease agreement with us 
we and the manufacturer have agreed in principle to terminate the construction contract by mutual agreement  subject to the execution of mutually acceptable documentation  but we cannot assure you that this will occur 
in connection with the termination of the contract  as of december   we had a receivable due from the satellite manufacturer of million  which represents amounts previously paid to the manufacturer of approximately million  liquidated damages and interest owed to us under the construction agreement 
the company expects that it will collect substantially all of this receivable and does not anticipate recording a charge to earnings related to this receivable 
in addition  we have agreed with the galaxy viii ir launch vehicle provider to defer our use of the launch to a future satellite 
facilities restructuring and severance costs on march   the company s management approved a plan to restructure several of its united states locations and close certain facilities  certain of which are currently being leased through upon approval of this plan  the company recorded a non cash charge in its consolidated income statement in the first quarter of of million 
this charge reflects future lease costs  net of estimated future sublease revenue  of million related to approximately  square feet of unused facilities and the write off of approximately million of leasehold improvements related to these facilities 
during the third quarter of  the company implemented a plan focused on further streamlining its operations through the consolidation of certain facilities 
as a result  the company recorded an additional non cash charge of million in its consolidated income statement for the three months ended september  this charge reflects future lease costs  net of estimated future sublease revenue  of million related to approximately  square feet of unused facilities and the write off of approximately million of leasehold improvements related to these facilities 
the company recorded severance costs of million for the year ended december  an additional million of severance costs was recorded during the first quarter of these costs were related to the company s expense reduction and net now webcast services restructuring plan that began in the third quarter of and were primarily comprised of employee compensation and employee benefits  outplacement services and legal and consulting expenses associated with the cumulative reduction in workforce of employees 
included in the severance costs was approximately million that relates to costs associated with the resignation of the former chief executive officer of panamsat in august in the third quarter of  the company recorded a restructuring credit of million for the reversal of prior period severance charges due to actual costs being lower than originally estimated 
at december   the company had million of accruals remaining from the facilities restructuring and severance charges recorded during and the remaining accruals primarily relate to long term lease obligations 
teleport consolidation plan in january  the company s management approved a plan to consolidate certain of its teleports in order to improve customer service and reduce operating costs 
this teleport consolidation plan includes the closure of certain teleports which are owned by the company 
under this plan  we expect the company s homestead and spring creek teleports will be permanently closed during and and the fillmore and castle rock teleports will provide reduced services 
our napa teleport will become the west coast hub for communications  video  and data services  taking on occasional use and full time services now provided by the fillmore teleport 
in addition to the pre existing services that it provides  the ellenwood teleport will serve as our east coast hub  providing similar services that migrate over from homestead and spring creek 
the company estimates that this consolidation plan will result in an overall gain of approximately million  of which a loss of approximately million will be incurred in and a net gain of approximately million will result in these costs consist of approximately million of severance related costs for which the employees will be required to perform future services  a million charge related to the write off of machinery and equipment costs and a net gain on disposal of land  buildings and equipment related to the teleports of approximately million 
severance related costs associated with this consolidation plan include compensation and benefits  outplacement services and legal and consulting expenses related to the reduction in workforce of approximately employees 
insurance settlements in october  we filed a proof of loss under the insurance policy on pas related to circuit failures  which occurred in september and resulted in a reduction of of the satellite s total power available for communications 
service to existing customers was not affected  and we expect that pas will continue to serve these customers 
the insurance policy was in the amount of million and included a provision for us to share of future revenues on pas with the insurers 
in the first quarter of  our insurers confirmed to us their agreement to settle the pas insurance claim by payment to the company of million 
pursuant to this agreement  no future revenue share payments will be required to be made in relation to pas during the first quarter of  the company recorded a gain of approximately million related to the pas insurance claim  which reflected the net proceeds agreed to by the insurers less the net book value of the pas satellite  including incentive obligations 
the company received the million of insurance proceeds in in january  we received a payment of approximately million relating to an insurance claim we filed with respect to our galaxy vii satellite 
the insurance settlement was recognized as an offset to the carrying value of the satellite and resulted in a million gain from proceeds in excess of the carrying value in in the third quarter of  the galaxy viii i satellite experienced difficulties with its xenon ion propulsion system xips  an electronic propulsion system that is used to maintain the spacecraft s proper orbit and position relative to earth 
the satellite is operating normally on its backup chemical propulsion system 
without the use of xips  the spacecraft was expected to reach its end of life in late panamsat accelerated depreciation of the spacecraft to reflect its revised operational life  resulting in an increase in its depreciation expense beginning in the fourth quarter of of approximately million per quarter through july galaxy viii i is now fully depreciated and is being operated in an inclined orbit as a supplement to galaxy iiic 
in september  in connection with anomalies on galaxy viii i  pas and pas  we agreed with our insurance carriers to settle all of our claims for net cash of approximately million  of which approximately million was collected as of december  and the remainder was collected during the insurance settlements were recognized as offsets to the carrying values of the related satellites  and no gain or loss has been recognized as a result of these settlements 
capital expenditures we have invested approximately billion in our existing satellite fleet and ground infrastructure through december  for the years ended december   and  our non satellite capital expenditures were million  million  and million  respectively 
as a result of the expenditures made prior to  we do not anticipate significant capital expenditures on non satellite infrastructure in the near future 
we made million of capital expenditures in and million of capital expenditures in we have presently budgeted approximately million for capital expenditures in sufficiency of funds we believe that amounts available under the revolving credit facility  future cash flows from operations and available cash and short term investments  will be sufficient to fund our operations  debt service requirements and our remaining costs for the construction and launch of satellites currently under development for at least the next months 
there can be no assurance  however  that our assumptions with respect to costs for future construction and launch of our satellites will be correct  or that funds available to us from the sources discussed above will be sufficient to cover any shortfall in funding for additional launches caused by launch failures  cost overruns  delays  capacity shortages or other unanticipated expenses 
in addition  if we were to consummate any strategic transactions or undertake any other projects requiring significant capital expenditures  we may be required to seek additional financing 
there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available at all or that  if available  will be obtained at terms favorable to us 
additional financing could also be dilutive 
if circumstances were to require us to incur additional indebtedness  our ability to incur any such additional indebtedness would be subject to the terms of our outstanding indebtedness 
the failure to obtain such financing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
cash flow items net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in net income adjusted for non cash items of million and a decrease in the cash used within prepaid expenses and other assets of million 
the decrease in cash used within prepaid expenses and other assets is primarily a result of an increase in the cash provided within prepaid satellite insurance of million  and an increase in cash provided within prepaid expenses and deferred charges for webcast services of million 
these increases in cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by a decrease in cash provided within accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million primarily resulting from the timing of payments to vendors  including satellite insurance payments 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase of million was primarily attributable to an increase in net income adjusted for non cash items of million  the decrease in cash used within prepaid expenses and other of million primarily resulting from a decrease in prepaid in orbit insurance related to fewer satellites placed in service in as compared to  and an increase in cash provided within accounts payable and accrued expenses of million primarily resulting from the timing of payments to vendors 
these increases in cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by a decrease in cash provided within operating leases and other receivables of million as a result of the effects on cash flows of the changes in accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  the decrease of million in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the receipt of million of additional proceeds from insurance claims during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and a reduction in capital expenditures in of million as compared to these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in cash used to purchase short term investments during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  the decrease in net cash used in investing activities of million was primarily due to the receipt of million of additional proceeds from insurance claims during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and a reduction in capital expenditures for satellite systems under development in of million as compared to the decrease in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by additional proceeds received from the sale of equipment of million in as compared to net cash used in financing activities decreased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease in net cash used in financing activities in was primarily due to billion of new borrowings obtained in the refinancing as well as million of repayments of long term debt in these decreases in net cash used in financing activities were partially offset by repayments of long term debt of billion under the hughes electronics term loan which was completed in february and the repayment of the galaxy iiir notes in january  as well as debt issuance costs paid during of million related to the refinancing 
net cash used in financing activities decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease of million in net cash used in financing activities in was primarily attributable to lower scheduled repayments of long term debt of million during  partially offset by a reduction in stock issued in connection with employee benefit plans in as compared to for the year ended december  cash decreased by million as a result of foreign exchange rate changes  as compared to for the years ended december  and the decrease in was primarily attributable to the devaluation of the brazilian real and increased activity in brazil after the company opened its first brazilian sales office in december commitments and contingencies satellite commitments we have invested approximately billion in our existing satellite fleet and ground infrastructure through december   and we have approximately million of expenditures remaining to be made under existing satellite launch and construction contracts 
included in these future expenditures are costs related to three c band satellites under construction by orbital sciences for united states coverage 
these satellites were purchased together  in volume  to take advantage of available discounts 
see satellite deployment plan and planned satellites planned satellites 
satellite insurance on february   the company filed proofs of loss under the insurance policies for two of its boeing model spacecraft  galaxy xi and pas r  for constructive total losses based on degradation of the solar panels 
service to existing customers has not been affected  and we expect that both of these satellites will continue to serve these existing customers 
the insurance policies for galaxy xi and pas r are in the amounts of approximately million and million  respectively  and both include a salvage provision for the company to share of future revenues from these satellites with their respective insurers if the proof of loss is accepted 
the availability and use of any proceeds from these insurance claims are restricted by the agreements governing our debt obligations 
we cannot assure you that the proof of loss with respect to these two satellites will be accepted by the insurers 
the company is working with the satellite manufacturer to determine the long term implications to the satellites and will continue to assess the operational impact these losses may have 
at this time  based upon all information currently available to the company  as well as planned modifications to the operation of the satellites in order to maximize revenue generation  the company currently expects to operate these satellites through their expected economic ends of life  although a portion of the transponder capacity on these satellites will not be useable during such time 
the company also currently believes that the net book values of these satellites are fully recoverable and does not expect a material impact on revenues as a result of the difficulties on these two satellites 
as of december   we had in effect launch and in orbit insurance policies covering satellites in the aggregate amount of billion  including galaxy vi  which was deorbited in january we have six uninsured satellites in orbit pas and pas  which are used as backup satellites  pas and pas for which we received insurance proceeds for constructive total losses  galaxy viii i  which continues to operate in an inclined orbit as a supplement to galaxy iiic  and galaxy xi 
the galaxy xi launch insurance policy lapsed in december the company elected not to purchase additional in orbit insurance for this satellite as the available terms were not commercially reasonable 
the claim for constructive total loss made under the launch policy was for losses experienced prior to the expiration of the policy 
of the insured satellites  five were covered by policies with substantial exclusions or exceptions to coverage for failures of specific components identified by the insurer as the most likely to fail and which have a lower coverage amount than the carrying value of the satellite s insurable costs significant exclusion policies 
these exclusions  we believe  substantially reduce the likelihood of a recovery in the event of a loss 
three of these satellites  pas  pas r and pas b  have redundancies available for the systems as to which exclusions have been imposed 
we believe that these redundancies allow for uninterrupted operation of the satellite in the event of a failure of the component subject to the insurance exclusion 
the fourth such satellite  pas  has an excluded component that we believe is unlikely to fail in the near future 
the fifth satellite  galaxy iiir  was replaced in september by galaxy iiic and will serve as a fleet backup 
at december   the uninsured satellites and the satellites insured by significant exclusion policies had a total net book value and other insurable costs of approximately billion 
of this amount  million related to uninsured satellites and million related to satellites insured by significant exclusion policies 
a supplemental policy on galaxy ivr for coverage of million related to sales type leases does have a component exclusion 
the primary policy on that satellite has no component exclusion 
see risks relating to our business our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if we were to suffer a loss that is not adequately covered by insurance 
panamsat corporation long term incentive plan effective december   the company amended the panamsat corporation long term incentive plan the stock plan to provide that  upon a change in control of the company  all unvested stock options and other awards granted under the stock plan would immediately vest and become exercisable  and restrictions on any awards such as restricted stock would immediately lapse 
a change in control is defined as i any transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which hughes electronics and or gm does not directly or indirectly own more than of the outstanding common stock  in value  of the company or any successor surviving entity  or ii the sale or distribution of all or substantially all of the assets of the company to an unrelated entity or entities or to an entity in which hughes electronics and or gm does not directly or indirectly own more than in value of the equity of such entity 
the company currently estimates that upon a change in control  the company will be required to record a charge of up to approximately million within its consolidated statement of income as a result of this amendment 
satellite incentive obligations satellite contracts typically require the company to make progress payments during the period of the satellite s construction and orbital incentive payments plus interest over the orbital life of the satellite 
the incentive obligations are subject to reduction or refund if the satellite fails to meet specific technical operating standards 
as of december  the company had million recorded in relation to these satellite incentive obligations 
customer and vendor obligations the company has certain contracts with its customers which require the company to provide equipment  services and other support to these customers during the course of the related contracts 
as of december   the company had commitments under these customer contracts which aggregated approximately million related to the provision of equipment  services and other support 
the company has certain long term contractual obligations with service providers primarily for the operation of certain of our satellites 
as of december   the company had commitments under these vendor contracts which aggregated approximately million related to the provision of equipment  services and other support

market risks we manage our exposure to market risks through internally established policies and procedures and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we use derivative financial instruments  including interest rate hedges to manage market risks 
additional information regarding our interest rate hedge is contained within item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources long term debt above 
the objective of our policies is to mitigate potential income statement  cash flow and fair value exposures resulting from possible future adverse fluctuations in interest rates 
we evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near term and long term fluctuations in interest rates on a daily basis 
this evaluation includes the review of leading market indicators  discussions with financial analysts and investment bankers regarding current and future economic conditions and the review of market projections as to expected future interest rates 
we utilize this information to determine our own investment strategies as well as to determine if the use of derivative financial instruments is appropriate to mitigate any potential future interest rate exposure that we may face 
our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
we determine the impact of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our financial instruments based on a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates from the rates in effect as of the end of the year for these financial instruments 
we use separate methodologies to determine the impact of these hypothetical changes on our sales type leases  fixed rate public debt and variable rate debt as follows for our sales type leases  a discount rate based on a year bond is applied to future cash flows from sales type leases to arrive at a base rate present value for sales type leases 
this discount rate is then adjusted for a negative change and then applied to the same cash flows from sales type leases to arrive at a present value based on the negative change 
the base rate present value and the present value based on the negative change are then compared to arrive at the potential negative fair value change as a result of the hypothetical change in interest rates 
for our fixed rate public debt  the current market rate of each public debt instrument is applied to each principal amount to arrive at a current yield to maturity for each public debt instrument as of the end of the year 
the current market rate is then reduced by a factor of and this revised market rate is applied to the principal amount of each public debt instrument to arrive at a yield to maturity based on the adverse interest rate change 
the two yields to maturity are then compared to arrive at the potential negative fair value change as a result of the hypothetical change in interest rates 
for our variable rate debt  the effect in annual cash flows and net income is calculated as a result of the potential effect of a hypothetical adverse fluctuation in interest rates 
the current libor rate plus applicable margin as of the end of the year is applied to the applicable principal outstanding at the end of the year to determine an annual interest expense based on year end rates and principal balances 
this calculation is then performed after increasing the libor rate plus applicable margin by a factor of 
the difference between the two annual interest expenses calculated represents the reduction in annual cash flows as a result of the potential effect of a hypothetical adverse fluctuation in interest rates 
this amount is then tax effected based on our effective tax rate to yield the reduction in net income as a result of the potential effect of a hypothetical adverse fluctuation in interest rates 
the only potential limitations of the respective models are in the assumptions utilized in the models such as the hypothetical adverse fluctuation rate and the discount rate 
we believe that these models and the assumptions utilized are reasonable and sufficient to yield proper market risk disclosure 
we did not experience any material changes in interest rate exposures during the year ended december  based upon economic conditions and leading market indicators at december   we do not foresee a significant adverse change in interest rates in the near future 
as a result  our strategies and procedures to manage exposure to interest rates have not changed in comparison to the prior year 
as of december   long term debt consisted of fixed rate borrowings of billion  million of floating rate debt  and million of floating rate debt that has been exchanged for a fixed rate obligation on million through august  refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources long term debt above 
as of december   long term debt consisted of fixed rate borrowings of million  billion of floating rate merger related borrowings due to hughes electronics and various other fixed and floating rate borrowings 
panamsat is subject to fluctuating interest rates on its floating rate debt and any changes in interest rates would impact results of operations and cash flows 
the potential effect of a hypothetical adverse fluctuation in interest rates for one year on panamsat s floating rate debt outstanding at december  and would be a reduction in cash flows of approximately million and million  respectively  and a reduction in net income of approximately million in each year 
fluctuations in interest rates may also affect the fair values of fixed rate borrowings and fixed rate net investments in sales type lease receivables 
at december  and  outstanding fixed rate borrowings bore interest at rates ranging from to and to  respectively  and sales type lease receivables bore interest between and 
the potential fair value change resulting from a hypothetical adverse fluctuation in interest rates related to panamsat s outstanding fixed rate debt and fixed rate net investment in sales type lease receivable balances would be approximately million and million as of december  and million and million as of december   respectively 
certain relationships and related transactions transactions with hughes electronics and its affiliates acquisition of hughes global services in january  the company announced that an agreement in principle had been reached with hughes electronics for the purchase of substantially all of the assets of hughes global services  inc hgs for approximately million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities  subject to certain adjustments 
the revenues of hgs in  less intercompany revenues recorded by panamsat  were approximately million 
hgs provides end to end satellite communications services to government entities  both domestically and internationally  as well as to certain private sector customers and is also a value added reseller of satellite bandwidth and related services and equipment 
they provide fixed and mobile satellite services with worldwide coverage using a wide range of satellites and satellite operators and equipment from a variety of suppliers 
the acquisition of the hgs business will give the company immediate access to a mature sales channel to the us government and government contractors through hgs general services administration gsa contract vehicle and will create opportunities to sell satellite capacity and related services into us  mexican  south african  indian and other government initiatives 
the acquisition will provide incremental preexisting revenues to our business and support our strategic initiative to expand our government service offerings 
while the company and hughes electronics have agreed in principle on the material terms of the purchase of the hgs business by panamsat  and we expect this transaction to close in march  definitive documentation of the transaction is still under negotiation and we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate the transaction or do so on the terms described above 
satellite procurement agreements we are a party to agreements with boeing  formerly hsc  for the construction of three satellites 
prior to the sale of hsc to boeing on october   hsc was an affiliate of ours 
we believe the agreements  which became obligations of boeing following the consummation of the sale by hughes electronics of hsc to the boeing company  are on commercially reasonable terms  as each was procured through a competitive bidding process 
we entered into an agreement in october for the construction of up to six satellites galaxy xr  galaxy ivr  pas  pas  galaxy viii ir and galaxy xiii  all of which were ordered 
galaxy xr  galaxy ivr  pas and pas were placed in service prior to  and galaxy xiii is currently under construction and is scheduled to be launched in mid we and boeing have an agreement in principle to terminate the construction contract for galaxy viii ir by mutual agreement 
see liquidity and capital resources receivable from satellite manufacturer above 
pursuant to such agreements and prior agreements with hsc for the construction of pas  pas  pas  pas  pas b  pas r  galaxy xi and galaxy iiic  a portion of the contract price between and for each satellite is paid in the form of incentive payments to be paid to hsc over a to year period after the construction and launch of the applicable satellite  contingent upon orbital performance over the design life of the satellite 
pursuant to our agreements with hsc  we recorded approximately million of satellite purchases from hsc during the year ended december  as hsc was sold to boeing on october   we did not record any satellite purchases from hsc during or satellite services we are a party to agreements with hughes electronics and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates collectively  the hughes entities pursuant to which we provide satellite capacity  tt c and other related services and facilities to the hughes entities  including hughes network systems  inc  hgs  directv latin america llc and directv  inc revenues derived from the hughes entities were million in  or of our revenues in  million in  or of our revenues in  and million in  or of our revenues in  making the hughes entities collectively our largest customer in each of those periods

backlog represents future cash payments expected from customers under all long term contractual agreements 
hughes electronics term loan prior to the refinancing in february  we had outstanding indebtedness owed to hughes electronics under the hughes term loan in the amount of billion 
the term loan had a scheduled maturity date of june   although hughes electronics had the right to request that we use our best efforts to replace the term loan at an earlier date 
consistent with the terms of the loan agreement  hughes electronics exercised that right  and we repaid the hughes term loan with the proceeds of the refinancing on february  quarterly payments of million in principal were required on the term loan under certain circumstances depending upon the level of cash flow from operations and our credit ratings 
we did not make  and were not required to make  any principal payments on the term loan prior to its repayment 
during the years ended december   and  we made approximately million  million and million  respectively  of interest payments to hughes electronics on the term loan 
the interest rate on the term loan was tied to the interest rate on our existing revolving credit facility 
the interest rate on the term loan as of the repayment date was 
as a result of certain arrangements between hughes electronics and the company  hughes electronics reimbursed the company for certain fees and expenses incurred in the refinancing 
such reimbursement was approximately million and was received in see liquidity and capital resources long term debt 
tax sharing arrangement we currently operate under a federal income tax sharing arrangement with hughes electronics  our parent corporation 
in accordance with such arrangement  we provide for current and deferred income taxes as if we were the common parent of an affiliated group that is not included in the consolidated federal income tax return that includes hughes electronics 
at december   our balance sheet reflected a deferred tax asset in the amount of million attributable to the future benefit from the utilization of certain net operating tax loss carryforwards  alternative minimum tax credits and foreign tax credits 
such tax sharing arrangement with hughes electronics does not provide for the payment by hughes electronics for any benefit relating to any of our then remaining net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes once we are no longer included in the same affiliated group with hughes electronics 
during  the internal revenue service commenced an examination of the gm consolidated tax group for the years of which the company is a member 
as a result  the company s federal income tax returns for those years are currently under examination 
management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustment which might be assessed as a result of this examination

recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas 
sfas provides that a loss on extinguishment of debt meet the requirements of apb to be treated as an extraordinary item in the statement of operations 
sfas also amends fasb statement no 
to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
in connection with the company s refinancing in the first quarter of  the company recorded an extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt as a result of the write off of the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs related to the hughes electronics term loan see liquidity and capital resources long term debt above 
upon adoption of the provisions of sfas related to the rescission of fasb statement no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt sfas  on january   the company will be required to reclassify this loss on extinguishment of debt to other expense  as it does not meet the new requirements for classification as an extraordinary item in accordance with sfas this reclassification will have no effect on net income but will result in lower income before income taxes of million for the quarter ended march  and year ended december  the other provisions of sfas were effective in the second quarter of and did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
whereas  under eitf issue no 
 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  as such  the company adopted the provisions of sfas effective january  the adoption of these provisions has not had a significant impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas  sfas which is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december   with early adoption permitted 
sfas was issued to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
if a company adopts the expensing provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas in  sfas allows for the following three methods of expensing stock options the prospective method apply the expensing provisions only to options granted  modified or settled in the year of adoption or later  or the modified prospective method apply the provisions starting in the year of adoption only to options granted  modified or settled after  or the retroactive restatement method restate all periods presented to reflect the fair value of employee options granted  modified or settled after in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
had compensation expense for employee stock options granted been determined based on the fair value of the options at the grant dates consistent with the provisions of sfas  the company s net income would have been reduced by approximately million  or per basic and diluted share in  million  or per basic and diluted share in and million  or per basic and diluted share in the company has elected to adopt the expensing provisions of sfas utilizing the prospective method beginning on january  therefore  the company will record compensation expense for employee stock options granted after december   but not in relation to previous awards granted 
compensation expense will be based on the fair value of the options at the respective grant dates utilizing the black scholes model for estimating fair value 
under the intrinsic value method reported previously  no compensation expense had been recognized on options granted through december   as the strike price of the options granted equaled the market price on the date of grant for all prior grants refer to note to the company s consolidated financial statements  retirement and incentive plans

the company has not yet determined the impact this issue will have on its consolidated results of operations or financial position  if any 
risks relating to our industry once launched and properly deployed  satellites are subject to significant operational risks due to various types of potential anomalies 
satellites utilize highly complex technology and operate in the harsh environment of space and  accordingly  are subject to significant operational risks while in orbit 
these risks include malfunctions  commonly referred to as anomalies  that have occurred in our satellites and the satellites of other operators as a result of the satellite manufacturer s error  whether due to the use of new and largely unproven technology or simply due to a manufacturing defect  problems with the power systems of the satellites  including circuit failures causing reductions in the power output of the solar array panels on the satellites  which could require the operator to forego the use of some transponders initially and to turn off additional transponders in later years  and failure of the cells within the batteries  whose sole purpose is to power the payload and spacecraft operations during the daily eclipse periods which occur for brief periods of time during two day periods around march and september  problems with the control systems of the satellites  including failure of the primary and or backup spacecraft control processor  and failure of the xenon ion propulsion system xips used on certain boeing satellites  which is an electronic propulsion system that maintains the spacecraft s proper in orbit position  and general failures resulting from operating satellites in the harsh space environment 
we have experienced anomalies in each of the categories described above 
although we work closely with the satellite manufacturers to determine and eliminate the cause of these anomalies in new satellites and provide for operational redundancies of certain critical components in the satellite to minimize or eliminate service disruptions in the event of failure  we cannot assure you that we will not experience anomalies in the future  whether of the types described above or arising from the failure of other systems or components  or that upon the occurrence of an anomaly  an operational redundancy will be available 
in particular  we may experience additional anomalies relating to the failure of the spacecraft control processor in certain of our boeing satellites not including our boeing hp satellites  various anomalies associated with xips in our boeing hp satellites  or a progressive degradation of the solar arrays in certain of our boeing satellites 
two boeing satellites that we operated in the past and other boeing s operated by others have experienced a failure of the primary and backup spacecraft control processors 
two of the boeing satellites that we currently operate have experienced a failure of the primary spacecraft control processor 
we have two other boeing satellites in orbit that have not experienced any anomalies related to their spacecraft control processors  but we cannot assure you that similar anomalies will not occur on those models 
certain of the boeing model hp spacecraft have experienced various problems associated with xips 
we operate seven satellites of this type 
we cannot assure you that problems associated with xips or other propulsion systems on our satellites will not occur in the future 
two of the three boeing satellites that we operate and other boeing s of a similar design operated by others have experienced a progressive degradation of their solar arrays causing a reduction in output power 
along with the manufacturer  we are monitoring the problem to determine its cause and its expected effect 
the power reduction may require the satellite operator to permanently turn off certain transponders on the affected satellite to allow for the continued operation of other transponders  which could result in a loss of revenue 
at this time  the power degradation has not required us to reduce the number of operating transponders on either affected satellite 
certain of our satellites are currently covered by insurance policies 
however  if we are adversely affected by the anomalies described above affecting those satellites  there can be no assurance that we will be reimbursed by the insurers  as they may dispute a payment obligation or the anomaly may occur outside of an insurance policy period 
in addition  there can be no assurance that  following the expiration of the current policies  we will be able to procure new insurance that covers losses of those types 
further  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain insurance for such satellites on commercially reasonable terms 
any single anomaly or series of anomalies could materially and adversely affect our operations  our revenues  our relationship with our current customers and our ability to attract new customers for our satellite services 
in particular  future anomalies may result in the loss of individual transponders on a satellite  a group of transponders on that satellite or the entire satellite  depending on the nature of the anomaly and the availability of operational redundancies 
anomalies may also cause a reduction of the expected useful life of a satellite  a reduction of the revenue generated by that satellite  or the recognition of an impairment loss 
finally  the occurrence of anomalies may adversely affect our ability to insure our satellites at commercially favorable premiums  if at all 
while some anomalies are covered by insurance policies  others are not or may not be covered 
new satellites are subject to launch failures  the occurrence of which can materially and adversely affect our operations 
satellites are subject to certain risks related to failed launches 
of the satellites launched by us or our predecessors since  three have resulted in launch failures 
in addition  certain launch vehicles that we have used or are scheduled to use have experienced launch failures in the past 
launch failures result in significant delays in the deployment of satellites because of the need both to construct replacement satellites  which can take months or longer  and obtain other launch opportunities 
such significant delays could materially and adversely affect our operations and our revenues 
launch vehicles may also underperform  in which case the satellite may still be placed into service by using its onboard propulsion systems to reach the desired orbital location  resulting in a reduction in its useful life 
in addition  although we have had launch insurance on all of our launches to date  if we were not able to obtain launch insurance on reasonable terms and a significant launch failure were to occur  our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
new or proposed satellites are subject to construction and launch delays  the occurrence of which can materially and adversely affect our operations 
the construction and launch of satellites are subject to certain delays 
such delays can result from the delays in the construction of satellites and launch vehicles  the periodic unavailability of reliable launch opportunities  possible delays in obtaining regulatory approvals and launch failures 
we have in the past experienced delays in satellite construction and launch which have adversely affected our operations 
future delays may have the same effect 
a significant delay in the future delivery of any satellite may also adversely affect our marketing plan for the satellite 
if satellite construction schedules are not met  there can be no assurance that a launch opportunity will be available at the time a satellite is ready to be launched 
further  any significant delay in the commencement of service of any of our satellites could enable customers who pre purchased or agreed to lease transponder capacity on the satellite to terminate their contracts and could affect our plans to replace an in orbit satellite prior to the end of its useful life 
the failure to implement our satellite deployment plan on schedule could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the market for satellite insurance has historically fluctuated significantly  and we may be unable to obtain new or renewal policies on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the price  terms and availability of insurance have fluctuated significantly since we began offering commercial satellite services in in the last several years  the cost of obtaining launch and in orbit policies on satellites reached historic lows but has recently begun to return to the higher levels for such policies that were common in the early s 
we expect the cost of obtaining such insurance to continue to rise and availability to be limited as a result of recent satellite failures and general conditions in the insurance industry  including the effects of the september th terrorist attacks 
launch and in orbit policies on satellites may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
in addition to higher premiums  insurance policies may provide for higher deductibles  shorter coverage periods  higher loss percentages required for constructive total loss claims and additional satellite health related policy exclusions 
for example  while we have since the late s been able to obtain launch policies covering a period of three to five years from the date of launch and in orbit policies covering a period of one to three years from the date of expiration of the applicable launch policy  providers of launch and in orbit insurance recently have informed us that they are unwilling to insure for periods greater than one year 
an uninsured failure of one or more of our satellites could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  higher premiums on insurance policies will increase our costs  thereby reducing our operating income by the amount of such increased premiums 
the fixed satellite services industry is heavily regulated  both in the united states and elsewhere  and such regulation could impede us from executing our business plan 
we are subject to the regulatory authority of the us government  primarily the fcc  and the national communications authorities of the countries in which we operate 
if we do not obtain all requisite regulatory approvals for the construction  launch and operation of any of our future satellites and for the orbital slots planned for these satellites or  the licenses obtained impose operational restrictions on us  or permit interference which could affect the use of our satellites  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will continue to coordinate successfully any or all of our satellites under fcc procedures domestically and under procedures of the international telecommunications union internationally 
such coordination is required in connection with domestic and international procedures that are intended to avoid interference to or from other satellites 
more specifically  the risks of government regulation include the fcc reserves the right to require satellites within its jurisdiction to be re located to a different orbital location if it determines that re location is in the public interest  our ability to replace an existing satellite with a new satellite is typically subject to fcc approval  governments  including the us government  have the ability to regulate satellite and terrestrial transmissions that have the potential to interfere with government operations  or other satellite or terrestrial commercial operations and such regulation could interfere with our contractual obligations to customers  currently unused orbital slots that have been granted to us may be revoked if we do not utilize such slots prior to their expiration dates  as was the case with two slots previously granted to us that the fcc revoked in because the regulatory schemes vary by country  we may be subject to regulations in foreign countries of which we are not presently aware 
if that were to be the case  we could be subject to sanctions by a foreign government that could materially and adversely affect our operations in that country 
there can be no assurance that any current regulatory approvals held by us are  or will remain  sufficient in the view of foreign regulatory authorities  or that any additional necessary approvals will be granted on a timely basis  or at all  in all jurisdictions in which we wish to operate our new satellites  or that applicable restrictions in those jurisdictions will not be unduly burdensome 
the failure to obtain the authorizations necessary to operate our satellites internationally could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we face risks in conducting business internationally 
a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states 
for the years ended december   and  approximately  and of our revenues were generated from customers outside of the united states 
we could be harmed financially and operationally by changes in foreign regulations and telecommunications standards  tariffs or taxes and other trade barriers 
although almost all of our contracts with foreign customers require payment in us dollars  customers in developing countries could have difficulty in obtaining the us dollars they owe us  including as a result of exchange controls 
exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the ability of our customers to pay us in us dollars 
if we ever need to pursue legal remedies against our foreign business partners or customers  we may have to sue abroad  where it could be hard for us to enforce our rights 
risks relating to our business our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if we were to suffer a loss that is not adequately covered by insurance 
certain losses of a satellite may not be covered by launch or in orbit insurance policies 
some of our satellites are covered by insurance policies that are subject to significant health related exclusions and deductibles related to specific components identified by the insurers as the most likely to fail or by a policy with a lower coverage amount than the carrying value of its insurable costs significant exclusion policies 
some of our satellites are uninsured 
moreover  any claims under existing policies are subject to settlement with the insurers 
as of december   we had in effect launch and in orbit policies covering satellites in the aggregate amount of billion  six of which were covered by policies with significant exclusion policies 
six of our satellites were uninsured 
as of such date  the uninsured satellites and the satellites covered by significant exclusion policies had a total net book value of satellites and other insurable costs of approximately billion 
as our other insurance policies expire  we may elect to reduce or eliminate insurance coverage of certain other satellites to the extent permitted by our debt agreements if  in our view  exclusions make such policies ineffective or the costs make such insurance impractical and if we believe that we can more effectively protect our business through the use of in orbit spare satellites  backup transponders and self insurance 
an additional risk to our business is that we do not generally obtain insurance to cover the risk of revenues lost as a result of satellite anomalies 
as a result  even if insurance were to cover a loss relating to a launch or in orbit failure  we would not be adequately compensated for lost revenue attributable to that loss 
as of december   the total net book value of satellites and other insurable costs  which includes certain sales type leases plus the estimated amount of warranty liabilities related to transponders sold outright  less incentive obligations  totaled approximately billion 
as of december   insurance covered approximately billion of these net insurable costs 
the partial or complete failure of any revenue producing satellites that are not substantially or fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our customers industry and regional market risks could materially and adversely affect us 
a significant portion of our business is with customers who may be adversely affected by recent events in certain industries and economic conditions in certain parts of the world 
of our top customers  we have identified six  representing approximately billion of our billion backlog  who may face such a risk 
included in these six customers is our largest customer  directv latin america 
they have announced that they have initiated discussions with certain programmers  suppliers  lenders  and business associates  including the company  to reduce excessive fixed costs and a substantial debt burden 
in that announcement  directv latin america indicated that if those discussions are not successful in the near future  they may file for a restructuring under chapter of the us bankruptcy law 
if directv latin america  one of the other larger affected customers  or a group of these customers becomes unable to perform some or all of the obligations to us  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our business is capital intensive  and we may not be able to access the capital markets when we would like to raise capital 
we may not be able to raise adequate capital to complete some or all of our business strategies or to react rapidly to changes in technology  products  services or the competitive landscape 
industry participants often face high capital requirements in order to take advantage of new market opportunities  respond to rigorous competitive pressures and react quickly to changes in technology 
many of our competitors are committing substantial capital and  in many instances  are forming alliances to acquire or maintain market leadership 
our business is capital intensive and there can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy our capital requirements in the future 
we are subject to significant and intensifying competition both within the fixed satellite services industry and outside the industry from companies offering other means to transmit signals  such as through fiber optics 
we face heavy competition in the fixed satellite services industry from companies such as newly privatized intelsat ltd 
and eutelsat sa  ses global ses global  the entity formed by the november acquisition of ge american communications  inc by societe europeenne des satellites  the luxembourg based operator of astra  one of europe s leading dth services  new skies satellites nv  and loral space communications ltd  among others 
intensifying competition in this market  particularly as a result of the privatization in of both intelsat and eutelsat  may result in lower prices for our services  which may adversely affect our results 
many of the owners of intelsat are government owned monopolies or privatized entities that are the dominant telecommunications companies in their home territories 
by virtue of their substantial investment in the intelsat system and their ties to government regulators  intelsat s owners have the incentive to  and may be able to  block us from entering certain non us markets 
there has been a trend toward consolidation of major fixed satellite service providers as customers increasingly demand more robust distribution platforms with network redundancies and worldwide reach  and we expect to face increased competition as a result of this trend 
for example  ses global now has the world s largest satellite fleet  and the combined entity is now capable of providing service in many of the markets we serve 
these and other direct competitors are likely to continue developing and launching satellites with greater power and more transponders  which may create satellite capacity at lower costs 
in order to compete effectively  we may have to invest in similar technology 
in addition  we believe that there are many companies that are seeking ways to improve the ability of existing land based infrastructure  such as fiber optic cable  to transmit signals 
any significant improvement or increase in the amount of land based capacity  particularly with respect to the existing fiber optic cable infrastructure and point to point applications  may cause our video services customers to shift their transmissions to land based capacity or make it more difficult for us to obtain new customers 
if fiber optic cable networks or other ground based high capacity transmission systems are available to service a particular point  that capacity  when available  is generally less expensive than satellite capacity 
as land based telecommunications services expand  demand for some satellite based services may be reduced 
some of our direct and indirect competitors  both those in and outside of the fixed satellites services industry  have greater financial resources and operating flexibility than we do 
this may permit them to respond better to changes in the industry 
risks relating to the company s indebtedness our substantial indebtedness could impair our financial condition and our ability to fulfill our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness  including the notes 
subject to the restrictions contained in the indenture governing our outstanding notes and in the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility obtained  we may incur additional indebtedness 
our substantial indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding notes and other indebtedness  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionately less debt  make it more difficult for us to borrow money for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes  and expose us to the risk of increased interest rates with respect to that portion of our debt which has a variable rate of interest 
if we are unable to meet our debt obligations  we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness  seek additional equity capital or sell assets 
we may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms  or at all 
the terms of our indebtedness impose significant restrictions on our business 
the indenture governing our outstanding notes and the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility contain various covenants that limit our ability to  among other things incur or guarantee additional indebtedness  make restricted payments  including dividends  create or permit to exist certain liens  enter into business combinations and asset sale transactions  make investments  reduce or eliminate insurance on our satellites  enter into transactions with affiliates  and enter into new businesses 
these restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing  sell assets  make acquisitions or needed capital expenditures  withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general  conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise 
our senior secured credit facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios 
our ability to meet future financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control  such as general economic conditions 
our failure to maintain any applicable financial ratios would prevent us from borrowing additional amounts under our senior secured credit facility and could result in a default under that facility  which could cause the indebtedness outstanding under the facility  and by reason of cross acceleration or cross default provisions  our outstanding notes and any other indebtedness we may then have  to become immediately due and payable 
if we were unable to repay those amounts  the lenders under our senior secured credit facility could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding or liquidation proceeding or proceed against the collateral granted to them and the holders of our senior notes issued in to secure that indebtedness 
if the lenders under our senior secured credit facility were to accelerate the repayment of outstanding borrowings  we might not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness  including the notes 
we may be unable to repurchase the senior notes if we experience a change of control 
if we were to experience a change of control  as defined in the indenture governing the senior notes  we will be required to make an offer to purchase all of the notes at a purchase price equal to of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
our senior secured credit facility restricts our ability to repurchase notes  including the repurchase of notes under a change of control offer 
our failure to repay holders tendering notes upon a change of control would result in an event of default under the senior notes 
a change of control  or an event of default under the senior notes  may also result in an event of default under our senior secured credit facility  which may result in the acceleration of the indebtedness under that facility requiring us to repay that indebtedness immediately 
if a change of control were to occur  we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds to repay debt outstanding under the senior secured credit facility or to purchase the senior notes or any other securities which we would be required to offer to purchase or that become immediately due and payable as a result 
we expect that we would require additional financing from third parties to fund any such purchases  and we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all
