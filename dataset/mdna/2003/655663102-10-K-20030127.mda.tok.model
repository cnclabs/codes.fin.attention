item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates the accounting policies and estimates it uses to prepare financial statements 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances 
actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management 
certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to the company s results of operations or financial position are discussed below 
revenue recognition most of the company s revenues are recognized upon shipment  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
a limited number of the company s large engineered systems sales contracts are accounted for using the percentage of completion method 
the amount of revenue recognized in any accounting period is based on the ratio of actual costs incurred through the end of the period to total estimated costs at completion 
during  the company recognized approximately million of revenue under this method with respect to one contract  which was substantially completed prior to year end 
the remaining revenues are recognized upon delivery 

table of contents goodwill goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired 
at november  goodwill represented approximately percent of the company s total assets 
the majority of the goodwill resulted from the acquisition of efd  inc in in  the company adopted fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which provides that goodwill should not be amortized but instead be tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level 
in accordance with no 
 the company completed a transitional goodwill impairment test that resulted in no impairment loss being recognized 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more often if indications of impairment exist 
the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined by applying appropriate discount rates to estimated future cash flows and terminal value amounts for the reporting units 
the results of the company s analyses indicated that no reduction of goodwill is required 
in  goodwill amortization was   on an after tax basis  or

inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost has been determined using the last in  first out method for percent of the company s consolidated inventories at november   with the first in  first out method used for the remaining inventory 
on an ongoing basis  the company tests its inventory for technical obsolescence  as well as for future demand and changes in market conditions 
the company has historically maintained inventory reserves to reflect those conditions when the cost of inventory is not expected to be recovered 
in the face of difficult economic conditions that accelerated the technical obsolescence of certain inventory and impacted the demand outlook for other inventory  the company recognized an inventory write down of million in the fourth quarter of million on an after tax basis  or 
per share 
pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans the measurement of liabilities related to pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans is based on management s assumptions related to future events including interest rates  return on pension plan assets  compensation increases and health care cost trend rates 
the discount rates used to determine the present value of future benefits are based on yields of aa quality or better fixed income investments 
the weighted average discount rate used to value pension plan obligations was percent at november   compared to percent at october  the rate used to value the postretirement obligation was percent at november   compared to percent at october  annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate at the end of the prior year 
the expected rate of return on pension assets is designed to be a long term assumption that will be subject to year to year variability 
the rate for was decreased to percent from percent in during  the fair market value of pension plan assets decreased 
actual pension plan asset performance will either reduce or increase unamortized losses  which will ultimately affect net income 
the rate of compensation increases was reduced from percent in to percent in to reflect actual experience 
the rate of increase in medical costs over the next five years was increased to reflect actual experience 
the health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported 
for example  a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects point increase point decrease effect on total service and interest cost components in effect on postretirement obligation as of november  employees hired after january  are not eligible to participate in the postretirement plan 
the overall effect of the assumption changes above will be to increase pension and postretirement expenses in fiscal

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company operates internationally and enters into transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
consequently  the company is subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled 
nordson regularly uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its risks related to most of these transactions 
these contracts  primarily euro and yen  usually have maturities of days or less  and generally require the company to exchange foreign currencies for us dollars at maturity  at rates stated in the contracts 
gains and losses from changes in the market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange losses and gains  respectively  on the underlying transactions 
the balance of transactions denominated in foreign currencies are designated as hedges of the company s net investments in foreign subsidiaries or are intercompany transactions of a long term investment nature
