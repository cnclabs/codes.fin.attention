return on average assets for rose to percent compared with percent in  while the return on average equity increased to percent in compared with percent in although interest rates declined in and  valley s net interest income increased million  contributing to increased earnings per share 
an increase in average loan and investment volume helped offset the decline in interest rates  as well as decreased interest rates paid on deposits and short term borrowings 
earnings for were also impacted by non interest income such as the gains on sales of securities  gain from the sale of an office building  increased income from additional investments in the bank owned life insurance boli and a gain from the sale of valley s canadian subsidiary  as well as a tax benefit realized as a result of the restructuring of an existing subsidiary into a reit 
these increases were partly offset by the loss of income due to the stock buyback program and higher salaries and employee benefit expenses  amortization of mortgage servicing rights  as well as distributions on capital securities 
net interest income net interest income continues to be the largest source of valley s operating income 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased to million for compared with million for higher average balances of total interest earning assets  primarily loans and taxable investments  were offset by lower average interest rates for these interest earning assets during compared with also  for  total average interest bearing liabilities increased causing interest expense to increase  but was substantially offset by declining rates associated with these liabilities compared to the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis increased to percent for compared with percent for in an effort to stimulate the economy  the federal reserve decreased short term interest rates basis points in november and in decreased short term interest rates eleven times for a total of basis points 
as a result  the prime rate declined and valley was able to reduce liability costs contributing to an increase in its net interest margin and net interest income 
in the latter part of  valley s net interest income and net interest margin were negatively affected by lower interest rates in conjunction with shorter duration investments  substantial investment and mortgage prepayments and the stock repurchase program 
the net interest margin and net interest income may continue to be negatively impacted in by a sluggish economy  continued low interest rates coupled with high loan and investment refinancing and prepayment 
there can be no assurances of how future changes in interest rates will affect net interest income 
average interest earning assets increased million or percent in over the amount 
this was mainly the result of the increase in average balance of loans of million or percent and the increase in average balance of taxable investments of million or percent 
average interest bearing liabilities for increased million or percent from average savings deposits increased million or percent while average time deposits decreased million or percent from average short term borrowings decreased million or percent over balances 
average long term debt  which includes primarily federal home loan bank fhlb advances  
table of contents increased million  or percent 
in conjunction with declining interest rates  valley re financed maturities on higher rate borrowings by converting to longer term fhlb advances resulting in a large increase in long term debt and a decrease in short term borrowings 
the extension of maturities was part of an effort to more closely match valley s funding sources with its loan portfolio and reduce future interest rate risk 
average interest rates  in all categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  decreased during compared to the average interest rate for loans decreased basis points to percent and the average interest rate for taxable investments decreased basis points to percent 
average interest rates on total interest earning assets decreased basis points to percent 
average interest rates also decreased on total interest bearing liabilities by basis points to percent from percent 
average interest rates on deposits decreased by basis points to percent 
the increase in the net interest margin from percent in to percent in resulted from a larger increase in net interest income in relationship to the growth in average interest earning assets and from reduced liability costs in conjunction with reduced yields in a declining interest rate environment 
valley generally has been able to increase the net interest margin in a declining rate environment  as there were a greater amount of liabilities tied to short term rates than assets 
however  since the november reduction in short term interest rates by the federal reserve bank  valley has experienced a margin compression  as rates on some deposit products have reached a floor 
conversely  in a rising interest rate environment  valley may experience some increase in its net interest margin
