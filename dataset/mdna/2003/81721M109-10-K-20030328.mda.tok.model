item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
this discussion includes references to funds from operations ffo 
we compute ffo as shown in the calculation in results of operations 
we consider ffo to be an appropriate measure of performance for a reit  along with net income and cash flow from operating  investing and financing activities because it provides investors with an indication of a reit s operating performance and its ability to incur and service debt  make capital expenditures  pay distributions and fund other cash needs 
ffo does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as a measure of financial performance or liquidity 
ffo is one important factor considered by our board of trustees in determining the amount of distributions to shareholders 
portfolio overview the following tables present an overview of our portfolio as of december  of properties of units beds investment of investment current annual rent revenues of current annual rent revenues facility type independent living communities skilled nursing facilities hospitals assisted living facilities total rent coverage tenant operator five star msls x msls x healthsouth na five star x five star x genesis x integrated x private companies combined x total properties where the majority of units are independent living apartments are classified as independent living communities 
rent coverage is calculated as operating cash flow from our tenants facility operations  before subordinated charges and capital expenditure reserves  divided by rent payable to us 
all tenant operating statistics are calculated based upon year ended december  operating results or the most recent tenant operating results provided to us by our tenants 
on march   the sec filed a complaint against healthsouth  alleging that healthsouth and certain of its officers committed fraud and violated several sec regulations by overstating their historical earnings and assets 
through the date of this report  healthsouth is current in its payment obligations to us  but  at this time  we do not have sufficient information about the sec allegations against healthsouth to know what impact they may have on our lease 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  total revenues for the year ended december   were million  compared to total revenues of million for the year ended december  included in total revenues for the year ended december   are revenues from facilities operations of million 
during  five star  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  operated facilities for our account 
on december   we distributed substantially all of our ownership of five star to our shareholders and five star became a separate public company 
in connection with the five star spin off  five star leased the facilities from us which it previously operated for our account  and  as a result  after the five star spin off  we do not have facilities operations revenues or expenses 
rental income for the year ended december   was million compared to rental income of million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase is due to our acquisition and lease of properties on january   for annual rent of million  our lease to five star of facilities which had been previously operated for our account for annual rent of million and our lease to five star which commenced in october for annual rent of million 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in annual rent from healthsouth of million to million resulting from a lease modification related to a non monetary exchange of properties  effective january  ff e reserve income for the year ended december   was million compared to zero for the year ended december  the lease with five star for certain properties acquired in january required a varying percentage of gross revenues be paid to us as additional rent which was escrowed for future capital expenditures at these leased facilities 
this lease was modified  effective october   and the ff e reserve escrow accounts are now owned by five star while we have security and remainder interests in these accounts and in property purchased with funding from these accounts 
as a result  we no longer receive ff e reserve income 
interest and other income for the years ended december  and  each include  of dividend income from the one million shares of hrpt that we own 
total expenses for the year ended december   were million  compared to total expenses of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
total expenses for the year ended december   include expenses from facilities operations of million 
subsequent to the five star spin off  we no longer have any facilities operations expenses 
interest expense for the year ended december   was million compared to interest expense for the year ended december   of million  an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to our issuance of million of senior unsecured notes in december and our assumption of debt in connection with our purchase of properties in january these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our revolving bank credit facility 
depreciation expense for the year ended december   was million compared to depreciation expense for the year ended december   of million  an increase of million 
recurring general and administrative expense for the year ended december   was million compared to recurring general and administrative expense for the year ended december   of million  an increase of million 
these increases were primarily due to our acquisition of properties in january and october and increased legal fees in connection with our litigation with marriott 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations during the year ended december   we incurred nonrecurring general and administrative costs totaling approximately million 
these costs were incurred in connection with the establishment of operating systems for foreclosed and repossessed properties  which systems were distributed to shareholders in the five star spin off 
in addition  we incurred million of non recurring costs in connection with the five star spin off 
distributions on trust preferred securities for the year ended december   were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is due to our issuance of trust preferred securities in june and july during the year ended december   we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of million related to a facility leased to five star which was closed during the second quarter of and sold during the fourth quarter of the loss includes historical depreciation expense as well as an impairment write down of the real estate associated with this property  offset by the sales proceeds received by us 
for the period  amounts were reclassified from depreciation expense and facilities operations revenues and expenses to the loss from discontinued operations 
net income was million  or per share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per share  for the year ended december   an increase of million  or per share 
this increase is primarily the result of the changes in revenues and expenses resulting from the january and october acquisitions and the five star spin off and the issuance of senior notes and trust preferred securities in  as described above  and the increase in weighted average number of shares outstanding between the and periods 
ffo for the year ended december   was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in ffo of million is due primarily to the same factors that created the increase in net income 
ffo for the years ended december  and  are calculated as follows dollars in thousands net income add depreciation expense five star spin off costs non cash charges general and administrative expenses related to foreclosures and lease terminations loss from discontinued operations less ff e reserve income funds from operations item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations through the quarter ended september   our ffo included ff e reserve income which was historically paid to us but escrowed for future capital expenditures at certain leased properties 
as described in note to the accompanying financial statements  we entered into an agreement to amend the lease pursuant to which our tenant  five star  retains title to the ff e escrow accounts while we retain security and remainder interests in the escrow accounts and in property purchased with funding from those accounts 
accordingly  effective october   our ffo no longer includes ff e reserve income 
in order to facilitate comparison of future ffo with historical results  this historical ffo presentation eliminates ff e reserve income 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  total revenues for the year ended december   were million  compared to total revenues of million for the year ended december  included in total revenues for the year ended december   were revenues from facilities operations of million 
on july   we assumed nursing home operations from bankrupt former tenants 
because we had not received substantially all of the licenses required to operate these facilities  we accounted for the facilities operations using the equity method of accounting during included in total revenues for the year ended december   is other real estate income of million  which represented the net operating income from these nursing home operations that we assumed as of july  as of january   we had obtained substantially all of the necessary licenses for these facilities and we consolidated the facilities operations 
for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   rental income decreased to million from million 
this decrease is primarily due to the sale of seven properties in and certain tenant bankruptcies  resulting in terminated leases and operations assumed by us 
interest and other income for the years ended december  and  include  and  respectively  of dividend income from the one million shares of hrpt that we own 
also included in total revenues for the year ended december   is a gain on foreclosures and lease terminations of million  which represented the excess of the security deposits forfeited  properties received and acceleration of deferred revenues  over the professional fees incurred  third party liabilities incurred  fixed asset impairment write downs and a reserve for funds to cure deferred maintenance  arising from the foreclosures and lease terminations settled in total expenses for the year ended december   were million  compared to total expenses of million for the year ended december  total expenses for the year ended december  included expenses of million from facilities operations  which were consolidated beginning january  during  we accounted for the facilities operations using the equity method of accounting and did not report expenses of facilities operations 
interest expense was million lower in the year ended december   compared to the same period in because the average balance outstanding and the weighted average interest rates on our credit facility were lower during the period 
the decrease in the average balance outstanding is due mainly to our issuance of million of trust preferred securities and million of our common shares for net proceeds of million during and the application of these net proceeds to borrowings outstanding under our revolving bank credit facility 
the decrease in interest expense was partially offset by distributions on the trust preferred securities 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations depreciation expense decreased in the year ended december   by  primarily due to the sale of seven properties in and the net effect of the assets disposed of versus the assets acquired in the settlement with our former tenants  offset by depreciation related to equipment purchases made since december  recurring general and administrative expense decreased by million primarily due to the impact of the sale of seven properties in during the year ended december   we incurred non recurring general and administrative costs totaling approximately million compared to million in the prior year 
these costs were incurred in connection with the establishment of operating systems for foreclosed and repossessed properties 
also during  we incurred million of non recurring costs in connection with the five star spin off 
net income was million  or per share  for the year ended december   as compared to million  or per share  for the year ended december  this decrease in net income is primarily the consequence of the gain of million on the sale of properties in and of the changes in revenues and expenses resulting from the tenant bankruptcies  settlements and sales of properties in as described above 
ffo for the year ended december   was million compared to million for the same period in the decrease of million is due primarily to the same factors impacting the decrease in net income 
ffo for the years ended december  and  are calculated as follows dollars in thousands net income add depreciation expense five star spin off costs non cash charges general and administrative expenses related to foreclosures and lease terminations loss from discontinued operations less gain on sale of properties gain on foreclosures and lease terminations funds from operations item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent developments on february   we entered a transaction with alterra healthcare corporation alterra as follows we purchased from alterra assisted living facilities with living units located in ten states 
the purchase price of million was paid in cash drawn under our revolving bank credit facility 
simultaneously with this purchase  we leased these properties to a subsidiary of alterra for an initial term through  plus renewal options 
the rent payable to us under this lease is million per year plus increases starting in based upon increases in the gross revenues at the leased properties 
we provided mortgage financing to alterra for six assisted living facilities with living units located in two states 
the amount of this mortgage loan is million 
the interest rate is per year 
the maturity of this loan is june   but we expect it may be prepaid as alterra sells the mortgaged properties 
as of march   alterra sold one of the six mortgaged properties and the sales proceeds of approximately  were paid to us and applied as a reduction of the mortgage loan balance 
alterra is a large publicly owned assisted living company 
alterra filed for bankruptcy reorganization in january our investment in properties leased and mortgaged by alterra was intended to help fund alterra s reorganization 
the alterra bankruptcy court approved the terms of our investment with alterra  and that approval included a decision that payments due to us under this lease and mortgage are accorded priority status under the bankruptcy code 
as discussed more fully in item legal proceedings  during  we and five star became jointly involved in litigation with marriott and msls  the operator of of the senior living communities which we leased to five star beginning in we believe that marriott and msls have materially breached the management agreements for these communities 
we also believe that the management agreements may be terminated if msls is sold to sunrise 
marriott announced that it had entered an agreement to sell msls to sunrise on december  however  the factual and legal issues involved in this litigation are complex and the final outcome of this litigation cannot be predicted 
also  this litigation is likely to be expensive to conduct and the total amount of this expense cannot be estimated at this time 
five star has continued to pay rent for the communities involved in this litigation 
if the management contracts are terminated  we believe five star would be able to operate the communities involved in this litigation 
we are unable to predict whether management of these communities by msls  and owned by sunrise  would have a material adverse effect on the communities  or whether that management may adversely affect five star s ability to pay rent 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on march   the sec filed a complaint against healthsouth  alleging that healthsouth and certain of its officers committed fraud and violated several sec regulations by overstating their historical earnings and assets 
through the date of this report  healthsouth is current in its payment obligations to us  but  at this time  we do not have sufficient information about the sec allegations against healthsouth to know what impact they may have on our lease 
liquidity and capital resources our total assets at december   were billion  compared to million at december  the increase is due primarily to million of acquisitions in  of which million  was funded with cash that was held at december  on january   we acquired senior living communities 
the purchase price was million and the total acquisition cost  after closing costs and purchase price adjustments  was million 
the funding for this acquisition was as follows million of assumed debt  a million purchase note  approximately million from our available cash  and the balance from borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility 
in february  we issued  common shares of beneficial interest  raising net proceeds of million 
these net proceeds were used to repay the million purchase note arising from our acquisition of properties in january  and the remainder was used to repay part of the borrowings outstanding under our revolving bank credit facility 
on june   we entered into a new revolving bank credit facility to replace our previous credit facility which was scheduled to mature in september the new credit facility matures in november and may be extended by us to november upon the payment of an extension fee 
the new credit facility permits borrowings up to million  which amount may be increased to million in certain circumstances 
drawings under the new credit facility are unsecured 
funds may be drawn  repaid and redrawn until maturity  and no principal repayment is due until maturity 
the interest rates at december  on borrowings under the new credit facility are calculated as spreads above libor which vary with the amounts of our debt outstanding and credit ratings 
the new credit facility is available for acquisitions  working capital and for general business purposes 
as of december   million was outstanding and million was available for drawing under the new credit facility 
on october   we acquired nine senior living properties  containing independent and assisted living units  for million which was funded by borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility and cash on hand 
these properties are leased to five star through december for annual minimum rent of million  plus percentage rent starting in funding for the alterra transaction described above in recent developments was provided by our revolving bank credit facility 
as of march   million was outstanding and million was available for drawing under the new credit facility 
funding for our current expenses and distributions to shareholders is provided primarily by our leasing operations 
minimum rents are generally received monthly or quarterly from our tenants and percentage rents are received monthly  quarterly or annually 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  future cash from leasing activities and availability under our revolving bank credit facility will be sufficient to meet our short term and long term capital requirements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to the extent we borrow on our revolving bank credit facility and as the maturity dates of our revolving bank credit facility and term debts approach over the longer term  we will explore alternatives for the repayment of amounts due 
such alternatives may include incurring new debt and issuing new equity securities 
on january   our shelf registration statement for the issuance of up to billion of equity and debt securities was declared effective by the sec 
as of december   billion was available under this effective shelf registration statement 
an effective shelf registration statement allows us to issue public securities on an expedited basis  but it does not assure that there will be buyers for such securities 
although there can be no assurance that we will consummate any securities offering or other financing  we believe we will have access to various types of financing with which to finance acquisitions and to pay our debt and other obligations 
debt and trust preferred covenants our principal debt obligations at december   were our unsecured revolving bank credit facility and our million of publicly held unsecured debt 
our public debt is governed by an indenture 
this indenture and our bank credit agreement contain a number of financial ratio covenants which generally restrict our ability to incur debts  including debts secured by mortgages on our properties in excess of calculated amounts  require us to maintain a minimum net worth  as defined  restrict our ability to make distributions under certain circumstances and require us to maintain other ratios  as defined 
our trust preferred securities are governed by an indenture which is generally less restrictive than the indenture governing our public debt and the terms of our revolving bank credit facility 
at december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our indentures and our credit agreement 
none of our indentures  our revolving bank credit facility or our other debt obligations contain provisions for acceleration or otherwise which would be triggered by a change in our debt ratings 
however  the interest rate payable under the revolving bank credit facility may change as our debt ratings change 
our public debt indenture contains cross default provisions to any other debts equal to or in excess of million  and similarly  a default on any of our public indentures would constitute a default under our bank credit agreement 
as of december   we have no commercial paper  derivatives  swaps  hedges  joint ventures or partnerships 
related party transactions in  hrpt distributed a majority of our shares to its shareholders of record on october  in order to effect this spin off and to govern relations after the spin off  we entered into a transaction agreement with hrpt  pursuant to which it was agreed that so long as i hrpt remains a more than shareholder of us  ii we and hrpt engage the same investment manager  or iii we and hrpt have one or more common managing trustees  then we will not invest in office buildings  including medical office buildings and clinical laboratory buildings  without the prior consent of hrpt s independent trustees and hrpt will not invest in properties involving senior housing without the prior consent of our independent trustees 
if an investment involves both office and senior housing components  the character of the investment will be determined by building area  excluding common areas  unless our board and hrpt s board otherwise agree at the time 
these provisions do not apply to any investments hrpt held at the time of the spin off 
also as part of the transaction agreement  we agreed to subject our ability to waive ownership restrictions contained in our charter to the consent of hrpt s trustees so long as hrpt owns more than of our outstanding voting or equity interest 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on december   we distributed substantially all of our shares of five star to our shareholders of record on december  in order to effect this spin off and to govern relations after the spin off  we entered into agreements with five star  pursuant to which it was agreed that so long as five star is our tenant  five star will neither permit any person or group to acquire more than of any class of five star s voting stock or permit the occurrence of other change in control events  as defined  nor will five star take any action that  in the reasonable judgment of us or hrpt  might jeopardize the tax status of us or hrpt as a reit  we have the option  upon the acquisition by a person or group of more than of five star s voting stock and upon other change in control events of five star  as defined  to cancel all of five star s rights under its leases with us  so long as five star maintains its shared service agreement with rmr or is a tenant under a lease with us  five star will not acquire or finance any real estate without first giving us  hrpt  hpt or any other publicly owned real estate investment trust or other entity managed by rmr the opportunity to acquire or finance real estate investments of the type in which we  hrpt  hpt or any other publicly owned real estate investment trust or other entity managed by rmr  respectively  invest  and upon our acquisition in of senior living communities  five star would acquire operating assets and liabilities related to these communities and begin to lease these communities from us for minimum annual rent of million 
all of the persons serving as directors of five star were trustees of senior housing at the time five star was spun off from us 
four of our current trustees are current directors of five star 
as of december   we lease senior living communities to five star for total annual minimum rent of million 
in the future  we may transact additional business with five star 
we believe that our current leases with five star were entered into on reasonable commercial terms 
however  because of the historical and continuing relationships which we have  these continuing and possibly expanding business relationships may not be arm s length and may not be on the same or as favorable terms as we might enter with third parties whom we did not have such relationships 
during  five star acquired seven senior living communities from a third party for million 
prior to their acquisition we waived our right to acquire these communities  subject to a continuing right to acquire or finance these properties in the event five star determines to sell or finance them 
to assist five star s financing of this transaction  five star sold a senior living community to us  which five star purchased in april for million  its approximate carrying value 
simultaneous with five star s acquisition of these seven senior living communities  we acquired eight other senior living communities from the same third party seller 
five star acquired operating assets and liabilities related to these eight communities 
also  five star leased these eight communities and the community we purchased from five star for minimum annual rent of million 
the terms of this transaction with five star were negotiated on our behalf by our independent trustee who is not on the board of five star 
during  we and five star became jointly involved in litigation with marriott and msls  the operator of of the senior living communities which we leased to five star beginning in we and five star expect to share the costs of this litigation 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in march  we terminated a lease for a nursing home facility in st 
joseph  missouri and evicted the tenant  which was not current in its rent obligations to us 
five star has agreed to manage this nursing home until it is re leased or sold 
five star will be paid a management fee of of the gross revenues from this nursing home 
we have an agreement with reit management research llc  or rmr  to provide investment  management and administrative services to us 
rmr is owned by barry m 
portnoy and gerard m 
martin  each a managing trustee and member of our board of trustees 
each of our executive officers are also officers of rmr 
our independent trustees  including all of our trustees other than messrs 
portnoy and martin  review our contract with rmr at least annually and make determinations regarding its negotiation  renewal or termination 
any termination of our contract with rmr would cause a default under our revolving bank credit facility  if not approved by a majority of lenders 
our current contract term with rmr expires on december  rmr is compensated at an annual rate equal to a percentage of our average real estate investments  as defined 
the percentage applied to our investments at the time we were spun off from hrpt is 
the annual compensation percentage for the first million of investments made since our spin off from hrpt is and thereafter is 
rmr may also earn an incentive fee based upon increases in funds from operations per share  as defined 
incentive fees are paid in our common shares 
until march   mr 
portnoy was a partner of sullivan worcester llp  our counsel  and counsel to hpt  hrpt  rmr  five star and affiliates of each of the foregoing and he received payments from that firm during in respect of his retirement 
as a result of former tenant bankruptcies and settlements  we assumed operating responsibilities for healthcare facilities effective in july under tax laws and regulations applicable to reits  we were required to engage a contractor to manage these properties after a day transition period 
we entered into management agreements with fsq  inc to provide these services in fsq was owned by messrs 
martin and portnoy 
under these management agreements  until september fsq was paid its costs and expenses incurred in managing the facilities for us and thereafter it was paid a fee equal to of patient revenues at the managed facilities 
as a result of the five star spin off  we no longer have a relationship with fsq 
in order for five star to acquire the personnel  systems and assets necessary to operate facilities which it leases from us  fsq merged into a five star subsidiary and five star entered into a shared services agreement with rmr pursuant to which rmr agreed to provide services similar to the services previously provided by rmr to fsq 
the fsq merger into five star was concluded on january  as a result of this merger  messrs 
portnoy and martin each received  shares of five star and five star assumed certain liabilities of fsq which were incurred in fsq prior operations 
critical accounting policies our most critical accounting policies concern our investments in real property 
these policies affect our allocation of purchase prices between various asset categories and the related impact on our recognition of depreciation expense  assessment of the carrying value of long lived assets  and classification of our leases 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations these policies involve significant judgments based upon our experience  including judgments about current valuations  ultimate realizable value  estimated useful lives  salvage or residual values  the ability of our tenants and operators to perform their obligations to us  and the current and likely future operating and competitive environments in which our properties operate 
in the future we may need to revise our assessments to incorporate information which is not now known  and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties we own  result in the classification of our leases as other than operating leases or decrease the carrying values of our assets 
during  we assumed the operations of nursing homes from bankrupt former tenants  pursuant to negotiated settlement agreements 
although these settlements as approved by the bankruptcy courts had financial effect as of july   the implementation of these settlements was subject to material conditions subsequent  including our obtaining health care regulatory licenses and medicare and medicaid provider contracts necessary to operate these nursing homes 
because the majority of the licenses and provider contracts had not been received prior to december   we reported the results of these nursing home operations using the equity method of accounting from july   through december  net income from these nursing homes was reported as other real estate income in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  during the first quarter of  we obtained substantially all of the healthcare regulatory licenses and medicare and medicaid provider agreements necessary for these nursing home operations  and we consolidated the nursing home operations effective january  with respect to the consolidated facilities operations  our most critical accounting policies in involved revenue recognition and our assessment of the net realizable value of the facilities accounts receivable 
these policies involved significant judgments based upon our experience  including judgments about changes in governmental payment methodology  contract modifications and economic conditions that affect the collectibility of the facilities accounts receivable 
as a result of the five star spin off  we no longer operate any facilities and we have not recognized any facilities operations revenues beginning january  also  the accounts receivable related to facilities operations were transferred to five star as part of the initial capitalization of five star 
as a result of this transfer  these receivables are not included on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  impact of inflation inflation might have both positive and negative impacts upon us 
inflation might cause the value of our real estate investments to increase 
in an inflationary environment  the percentage rents which we receive based upon a percentage of our tenants revenues should increase 
offsetting these benefits  inflation might cause our costs of equity and debt capital and other operating costs to increase 
an increase in our capital costs or in our operating costs will result in decreased earnings unless it is offset by increased revenues 
in periods of rapid inflation  our tenants operating costs may increase faster than revenues and this fact may have an adverse impact upon us if our tenants operating income from our properties becomes insufficient to pay our rent 
to mitigate the adverse impact of increased operating costs at our leased properties  we generally require our tenants to guarantee our rent 
to mitigate the adverse impact of increased costs of debt capital in the event of material inflation  we previously have purchased interest rate cap agreements and we may enter into similar interest rate hedge arrangements in the future 
the decision to enter into these agreements was and will be based on the amount of floating rate debt outstanding  our belief that material interest rate increases are likely to occur and upon requirements of our borrowing arrangements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations impact of government reimbursement approximately of our rents come from properties where approximately or more of the operating revenues are derived from residents who pay from their own private resources 
of the remaining of our rents which come from properties where the revenues are heavily dependent upon medicare and medicaid programs  the operations of these properties currently produce sufficient cash flow to support our rent 
however  as discussed above in business government regulation and reimbursement  we expect that medicare and medicaid rates paid to our tenants may not increase in amounts sufficient to pay our tenants increased operating costs  or that they may even decline 
also  the hospitals we lease to healthsouth are heavily dependent upon medicare revenues 
as discussed above in recent developments  recent reports of possible erroneous financial statements by healthsouth have called into question whether those hospitals in fact produce sufficient revenues to pay our rent 
we cannot predict whether our tenants which are affected by medicare and medicaid rates will be able to continue to pay their rent obligations if these expected circumstances occur and persist for an extended period 
seasonality nursing home and assisted living operations have historically reflected modest seasonality 
during calendar fourth quarter holiday period s residents at such facilities are sometimes discharged to join in family celebrations and admission decisions are often deferred 
the first quarter of each calendar year usually coincides with increased illness among residents which can result in increased costs or discharges to hospitals 
as a result of these factors and others  these operations sometimes produce greater earnings in the second and third quarters of each calendar year and lesser earnings in the fourth and first calendar quarters 
we do not expect these seasonal differences to have a material impact upon the ability of our tenants to pay our rent 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to this market risk through our monitoring of available financing alternatives 
our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates is unchanged since december  other than as described below we do not now anticipate any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the future 
at december   our outstanding debt included million of senior unsecured notes due in the interest on these notes is payable semi annually 
no principal payments are due under these notes until maturity 
because these notes bear interest at a fixed rate  changes in market interest rates during the term of this debt will not affect our operating results 
if at maturity these notes are refinanced at interest rates which are higher than the current rate  our per annum interest cost would increase by approximately million 
we are allowed to make prepayments on these senior notes at par plus a make whole premium  as defined 
these prepayment rights may afford us the opportunity to mitigate the risk of refinancing at maturity 
changes in market interest rates also affect the fair value of our debt obligations  increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt  while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
our total fixed rate debt obligations outstanding at december   was million  including the million of notes due in and mortgage notes totaling million due in a hypothetical immediate one percentage point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of all our fixed rated debt obligations by approximately million 
at december   we had million of trust preferred securities outstanding  the dividends on which are dependent upon our making required payments on our junior subordinated debentures due no principal repayments are due on the debentures until maturity 
if the debentures were to be refinanced at interest rates which are higher than the current rate  our per annum interest cost would increase  our trust preferred securities are listed on the nyse and their market value is principally determined by supply and demand factors 
the market price  if any  of our debentures as of december   may be sensitive to changes in interest rates  similar to our unsecured senior notes discussed above 
based on the balance outstanding at december   and discounted cash flow analysis through the maturity date of the trust preferred securities  a hypothetical immediate one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our fixed rate debentures by approximately million  respectively 
our debentures have provisions that allow us to make repayments earlier than the stated maturity date 
these prepayment rights may afford us the opportunity to mitigate the risk of refinancing at maturity at higher rates by refinancing at lower rates prior to maturity 
our ability to prepay the debentures at par  beginning june   will also effect the change in the fair value of the debentures which would result from a change in interest rates 
for example  discounted cash flow analysis of a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates calculated from december   to the first par prepayment option date for our trust preferred securities would decrease or increase the value of those securities by  respectively 
our unsecured revolving bank credit facility bears interest at floating rates and matures in november as of december   we had million outstanding and million available for drawing under our revolving bank credit facility 
we borrow in us dollars and borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility are subject to interest at libor plus a premium 
accordingly  we are vulnerable to changes in us dollar based short term rates  specifically libor 
a change in interest rates would not affect the value of this floating rate debt but would affect our operating results 
for example  the interest rate payable on our outstanding indebtedness of million at december   was per annum 
the following table shows the impact a change in interest rates would have on our interest expense for the floating rate debt outstanding at december  interest rate per year outstanding debt total interest expense per year at december  reduction increase the foregoing table shows the impact of an immediate change in floating interest rates 
if interest rates were to change gradually over time  the impact would be spread over time 
our exposure to fluctuations in floating interest rates has increased since december   and it may increase further in the future if we incur debt to fund acquisitions or otherwise
