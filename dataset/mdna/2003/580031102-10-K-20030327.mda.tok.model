item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with risk factors and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this document 
critical accounting policies and estimates general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of mcdata s board of directors 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generally recognize revenue  in accordance with sab  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  products are delivered or services rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is assured 
with respect to revenue from product sales to our resellers and end user customers  we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  generally at the time the product is delivered to the customer 
revenue from product sales to our oems and distributors is recognized when title and risk of loss transfer to the customer in accordance with the master agreement  generally upon sell through to the end user 
revenue is reduced for estimated customer returns  price protection  rebates  and other offerings that occur under sales programs established with the company s oems  distributors and resellers 
service revenues  which to date have not been material  include training  consulting and customer support 
revenue from training and consulting are recognized when the service has been performed and the customer has accepted the work 
we recognize revenue from support or maintenance contracts  including post contract customer support  or pcs  services  ratably over the contractual period 
we recognize revenue from software products in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  as amended 
software revenue is allocated to the software license and pcs service elements using vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  or vsoe  and recognized appropriately as discussed above 
vsoe of the fair value for an element is based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
in transactions that include multiple products  services and or software  we allocate the revenue to each element based on their relative fair values or in the absence of fair value  the residual method and recognize the revenue when the above recognition criteria have been met for each element 
inventory reserves we value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable values 
we regularly review inventory on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based upon assumptions about current and future demand for our products  the current market conditions  new product introductions  new technologies and the current life cycle of our products 
adverse changes in these factors and our assumptions could result in an increase in the amount of excess and obsolete inventory on hand and increase our cost of revenue 
additionally  we have certain purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers that are non cancelable 
we may be liable for materials that our third party manufacturers purchase on our behalf if our actual requirements do not meet or exceed our forecasts and those materials cannot be redirected to other uses by the contract manufacturers 
we evaluate these open purchase orders in light of our current inventory on hand  expected demand  market conditions and new product introductions 
based on this information  we record purchase obligations for inventory we believe is excess or obsolete and cannot be redirected to other uses by our contract manufacturers 
adverse changes in our and our contract manufacturers calculations and assumptions concerning these purchase commitments may result in an increase to our vendor obligations and increase our cost of revenue 
during the year ended december  and  we recorded and million  respectively  of net write downs to our inventory related to a review of obsolescence  end of life and demonstration evaluation inventories  on going inventory commitments and a year end physical inventory analysis 
as a result of our outsource focused manufacturing model  our net inventory balance at december  was  down from million at december  valuation of accounts receivable we review accounts receivable to determine which are doubtful of collection 
in addition  we also make estimates of potential future product returns 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts and product returns  we consider specific accounts  analysis of our accounts receivable aging  changes in customer payment terms  historical write offs and returns  changes in customer demand and relationships  concentrations of credit risk and customer credit worthiness 
historically  we have experienced a low level of write offs and returns given our customer relationships  contract provisions and credit assessments 
changes in the credit worthiness of customers  general economic conditions and other factors may impact the level of future write offs and product returns and increase our general and administrative expenses 
warranty provision we also provide for estimated expenses for warranty obligations as revenue is recognized 
our warranty accruals utilize management s estimates of potential future product warranty claims including the estimated numbers of failures by product and estimated costs to repair or replace failed product 
we have not experienced material warranty claims  however material warranty claims  including the catastrophic or epidemic failure of any one of our products  would require revisions to the estimated warranty liability and could significantly increase our product costs  reduce revenue and cause significant customer relations problems 
valuation of deferred taxes significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction where we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
at december   our deferred tax assets equaled million 
we are required to assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
we have considered estimated future taxable income and our ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance and concluded that no such allowance is required at december  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future  we would have to record a valuation allowance that would significantly reduce net income in the period such a determination were made 
valuation of long lived assets including goodwill and purchased intangible assets we review property  plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
our asset impairment review assesses the fair value of the assets based on the future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
an impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset if any are less than the carrying value of the asset 
this approach uses our estimates of future market growth  forecasted revenue and costs  expected periods the assets will be utilized and appropriate discount rates 
we have performed and will perform an annual impairment test for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
this review is based on a comparison of the fair value of our assets including goodwill balances using discounted estimated cash flows to the net carrying value of our assets 
the assumptions used to estimate fair value include our best estimate of future growth rates  capital expenditures  discount rates and market conditions over an estimate of the remaining operating period 
we performed the impairment test and determined that no impairment loss should be recognized 
due to changing business conditions  future tests may result in a need to record a loss due to write down of the value of goodwill 
at december   goodwill recorded in the consolidated balance sheet totaled million 
we currently operate our business as a single solutions business and do not maintain separate cash flows or operating margins 
future operating losses  deterioration of our business or segmentation of our operations in the future could also lead to impairment adjustments as such issues are identified 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenues 
years ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative acquired in process research development and other acquisition related costs amortization of deferred compensation operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss revenues our revenue for the year ended december  was million  a decrease compared with revenue of million for the year ended december  our revenue in was negatively impacted by the unfavorable economic conditions and suppressed it storage and infrastructure spending  in particular in the high end director market and our transition from gb to gb products in the first half of this environment had a particularly negative effect on our product revenue  which declined to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  in the last half of  however  our new product introductions  including our gb directors and switches and our sphereon switch  with flexport capability  were widely received with higher than expected demand and revenue in the last half of we cannot predict when the it spending environment will improve  if at all 
there continues to be a level of uncertainty as to how the macro economic environment may influence it spending in we are pleased  however  with the demand for our new products and expect the demand to continue into our fiscal year 
lastly  our sale of the hba product line in early reduced our product revenue by approximately million from levels 
revenue for the year ended december  represented a increase over revenue of million in product revenue of million for the year ended december  was a increase over product revenue of million in this revenue increase was generated from the increased demand in our storage products including our newly introduced series director and series switch products 
software and service revenue increased to million in from million in and million in we continue to experience revenue growth from the sale of all our software products  in particular our sanavigator software product that was acquired as part of the business acquisition completed in late september the increase in software and service revenue for the year ended december  from the year ended december  included an approximate million of software revenue that was deferred pursuant to a contract obligation that did not meet our revenue recognition criteria until when the deferred software revenue was recognized in full 
other revenues for the year  including service fees earned under an escon service agreement with emc  declined to million in from million in and million in this revenue also reflects the growth in maintenance fees  which outpaced the decline in service fees related to the escon products 
we anticipate that service revenue from emc under the escon service agreement will continue to decrease in future years 
a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated with two of our oem customers 
for the year ended december   approximately of our total revenue  excluding the escon service fee  came from our former parent  emc  compared to in and in in february  emc distributed its remaining shares of mcdata class a common stock in a tax free distribution to its shareholders 
emc no longer has any ownership in or voting power over mcdata and  therefore  is no longer considered a related party 
additionally  ibm contributed approximately of our total revenue for the year ended december  compared to in and in we expect a majority of our revenues in the foreseeable future to be derived from these two customers 
the level of sales to any single customer may vary and the loss of any one significant customer  or a decrease in the level of sales to any significant or group of significant customers  could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
domestic and international revenue was approximately and of our total revenue  respectively  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   domestic and international revenue was approximately and of our total revenue  respectively  and for the year ended december   domestic and international revenue was approximately and  respectively 
revenue is attributed to geographic areas based on the location of the customers to which our products are shipped including shipments to oem customers who take possession of our products domestically and then distribute the products to their international customers 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  was compared to in and in the significant increase in our gross margin during was the result of higher margin sales realized on our product and software introductions as well as reduced inventory costs related to lower inventory write downs of million in compared to million in when we discontinued certain products  and our increased focus in on our outsource focused manufacturing model 
offsetting the impact of these activities was the sale of certain high cost inventory manufactured in the last half of and increased capitalized software amortization expense 
as expected  this high cost inventory was fully depleted by the end of the quarter ended june  the decrease in our gross margin percentage for the year ended december  from the year ended december  was primarily the result of increased manufacturing and component costs and inventory related charges 
during  we experienced increased manufacturing and component costs related to a transition to multiple product lines and quality problems on component parts 
specifically  we incurred increased costs related to some mechanical features of our low end and mid range switch products 
also  we incurred additional costs related to our die cast chassis for these products 
we continued to use this high cost inventory at the end of december  in addition  gross margins in were adversely affected by charges of approximately million primarily related to excess and obsolete inventory held by both the company and our contract manufacturers 
operating expenses research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for  compared with million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the approximate million or increase was primarily attributable to increases in staffing levels  non recurring engineering charges  and depreciation related to engineering and test equipment 
offsetting these expenses were approximately million of software development costs that have been capitalized and are amortized over the useful life of the underlying products as costs of revenue 
capitalized software costs were  and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
capitalized software development costs have increased with the acquisition of the sanavigator software business and the development of our new director and switch products 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million for  compared with million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
increases in sales and marketing expenses were primarily due to the expansion of our sales and marketing organizations  and increased salaries and commissions associated with increased revenues 
in addition  as a result of our anticipated transition of our products to gb technology in the second quarter of  we recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of primarily related to the impairment of certain gb related equipment currently used for demonstration and evaluation purposes 
we believe that continued investment in our sales and marketing functions is critical to the success of our business strategies 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for compared with million for and million for the increase for the year ended december  was due primarily to increased staffing levels  higher facilities costs associated with our new campus building  a million charge related to the termination of our collateralized lease agreement and increased legal fees due to the patent infringement lawsuit 
acquired in process research and development and other acquisition related costs 
in connection with our acquisition of sanavigator in september  we incurred non recurring acquisition costs and integration related charges 
additionally  a portion of the sanavigator purchase price was allocated to in process research and development ipr d 
this ipr d was expensed at the time of purchase because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative use existed 
the ipr d charge totaled million for the year ended december  there were no corresponding charges for the years ended december  and the other acquisition related charges recorded during the year ended december   related primarily to one time consideration paid for the completion of ongoing employment arrangements with sanavigator employees 
there have been no acquisitions of ipr d during the years ended december  and amortization of deferred compensation 
we have recorded deferred compensation in connection with certain class b stock options granted prior to our august  initial public offering and certain restricted class b stock grants issued under our executive compensation plan 
we are amortizing all deferred compensation on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the applicable options and stock awards  resulting in amortization expense of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively of which approximately   and  respectively  is included in costs of revenue 
interest and other income 
interest income and other consisted primarily of interest earnings on our cash  cash equivalents and various investment holdings 
interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in investment income during was primarily the result of a decrease in our investment balances and declining interest rates realized during the average rate of return on investments for the year ended december  was compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
increases in interest income from were due primarily from the investment of the net proceeds from our initial public offering in august interest income is expected to increase in future periods as a result of income earned on the proceeds from our february convertible debt offering 
this increased income will be offset in future periods by increased interest expense related to the debt 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  compared with and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our effective tax rates have historically differed from the federal statutory rate for various reasons 
the effective tax rate in decreased from primarily due to the favorable tax benefit of increased municipal interest income 
we currently anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately for our new fiscal year ending on january  our ability to realize this tax rate requires that we generate the pretax income as planned  including maintaining the level of research and development spending 
to the extent that our revenues and earnings differ from our expectations  or unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations occur  our tax rate could change 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and available for sale investments were million at december   a decrease of million from million at december  we generated approximately million in net cash from operating activities  primarily from net income before non cash charges including depreciation and amortization  deferred compensation  inventory related charges and deferred income tax benefits 
also  included in cash from operations was million of income tax benefits related to employee stock option transactions 
at december   we had deferred tax assets of million which we believe will be realizable through future profitable operations 
net cash used in investing activities was million 
during the year ended december   we completed and occupied our office and engineering building in which contributed to the approximate million of purchases of property and equipment 
offsetting these capital purchases was million of net maturities of our short and long term investments  including the approximately million of restricted assets used for the campus building under the terminated collateralized lease agreement see discussion below 
net cash from financings was near zero as proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock related to employee participation in our employee stock plans substantially offset million of repayments of our obligations under our capital leases 
our principal sources of liquidity at december  consisted of our cash and available for sale investments of million  net accounts receivable of million and our equipment financing arrangements  which totaled approximately million 
borrowings under our equipment financing arrangements are secured by the related capital equipment and are payable through december  in addition  in february  the company sold million of convertible subordinated notes due february   raising net proceeds of approximately million 
the notes are convertible into our class a common stock at conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes aggregate of approximately million shares 
upon a conversion  the company may choose to deliver shares of our class a common stock  or  in lieu of shares of our class a common stock  cash or a combination of cash and shares of class a common stock 
commitments we have contracted with the contract manufacturers for the manufacture of printed circuit boards and box build assembly for specific fibre channel directors and switches 
the agreements require us to submit purchasing forecasts and place orders sixty calendar days in advance of delivery 
at december   our commitment with the contract manufacturers for purchases over the next sixty days totaled million 
additionally  the contract manufacturers had on hand materials purchased on behalf of mcdata valued at approximately million 
finally  the contract manufacturers have outstanding purchase commitments outstanding related to materials that had also been ordered by our contract manufacturers on our behalf 
we may be liable for materials that the contract manufacturers purchase on our behalf if our actual requirements do not meet or exceed our forecasts and those materials cannot be redirected to other uses 
at december   we had recorded obligations of approximately million primarily related to materials purchased by ssci for certain end of life and obsolete material used to manufacture our products 
we do not expect the remaining commitments under these agreements to have a continued material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
on february  and amended on may   november  and january   we entered into an operating lease and associated agreements with deutsche bank for the lease of an approximately  square foot multi story office and engineering building to be constructed on a acre parcel of land located in broomfield  colorado 
construction of the building commenced in the first half of and completed in july  at which time lease payments were scheduled to commence 
as part of the transaction  we guaranteed a residual value of the facility to deutsche bank of approximately during the construction period and thereafter of the million total original cost 
we agreed to restrict up to million of our investment securities as collateral for specified obligations under the lease 
during the first quarter of  we elected to terminate the lease under the provisions of the agreements 
on may   we entered into a termination agreement with deutsche bank and recorded approximately million in construction costs as property and equipment 
additionally  million in restricted assets were used to pay down the balance of the lease obligation and construction costs 
a loss of million was recorded during the first quarter of to reflect the write off of certain lease costs that could not be capitalized 
as of june   construction of the new building was substantially complete and occupation of the building by our engineering departments began in july the following table summarizes our contractual obligations including interest expense and commitments as of december  in thousands total less than year years non cancelable operating leases    capital leases    vendor reserves   we believe our existing cash  short term and long term investment balances  and cash expected to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements at least through the next twelve months  although we could be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding prior to that time 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support development of new products and expansion of sales and marketing  the timing of new product introductions and enhancements to existing products  and market acceptance of our products 
inflation we believe that our revenue and results of operations have not been significantly impacted by inflation during the last three fiscal years

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk  primarily from changes in interest rates and credit risks 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk due to changes in the general level of united states interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents and our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio is primarily maintained in four major financial institutions in the united states and consists primarily of readily marketable investment grade debt securities of various issuers and maturities ranging from overnight to ten years 
all investments are denominated in us dollars and are classified as available for sale 
these instruments are not leveraged  and are not held for trading purposes 
as interest rates change  the amount of unrealized gain or loss on these securities will change 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of december   using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical adverse movement in the levels of interest rates with all other variables held constant 
the discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at december  the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair values of our investment instruments of approximately  assuming that such investment holdings remained constant through the year and an increase of investment income of approximately  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would result in an increase of the fair values of our investment instruments of approximately  and a decrease in investment income of approximately  credit risk financial instruments which potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments  short and long term investments  trade receivables and certain share option transactions 
the company places its temporary cash investments and short and long term investments in investment grade instruments and limits the amount of investment with any one financial institution 
the company evaluates the credit risk associated with each of its customers and has concluded that it does not have a material exposure to credit risk with its customers 
in february  the company sold million of convertible subordinated notes due february  in conjunction with the issuance of these convertible notes  we also entered into share option transactions on our class a common stock with bank of america  na and or certain of its affiliates 
subject to the movement in our class a common stock price  we could be exposed to credit risk arising out of net settlement of these options in our favor 
based on our review of the possible net settlements and the credit strength of bank of america  na and its affiliates  we have concluded that we do not have a material exposure to credit risk as a result of these share option transactions
