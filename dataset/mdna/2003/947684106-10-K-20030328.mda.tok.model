overview we provide employee internet management  or eim  solutions that enable businesses to analyze  report and manage how their employees use computing resources at work  including the internet 
our primary product  websense enterprise  gives businesses the ability to rapidly implement and configure internet access policies in support of their efforts to improve employee productivity  conserve network bandwidth  mitigate potential legal liability and enhance network security 
in  we released our first software product  websense internet screening system  and since that time  we have focused our business on developing and selling eim solutions 
in december  we released websense enterprise version  which was sold through fiscal year we launched the next generation of websense software websense enterprise version in march  including enhanced eim capabilities and new network and application management technology such as client application manager and bandwidth optimizer 
we currently derive nearly all of our revenue from subscriptions to the websense enterprise solution and expect this trend to continue in the future as more offerings are added to the websense enterprise platform 
during  we derived approximately of revenue from international sales compared with approximately for despite the decline year over year as a percentage of total revenue  international sales increased in and we believe international markets represent a significant growth opportunity and are continuing to expand our international operations  particularly in selected countries in the european and asia pacific markets 
we currently sell websense enterprise through both indirect and direct channels  however  sales through indirect channels currently account for more than of our revenue and our strategy is to continue to rely on indirect sales channels for a significant majority of our sales 
as described below  we recognize revenue from subscriptions to websense enterprise on a monthly straight line basis over the term of the subscription 
we recognize the operating expenses related to these sales as they are incurred 
these operating expenses include commissions relating to the sale of new subscriptions  which are based on the total amount of the subscription contract and are fully expensed in the period the product is delivered 
operating expenses have continued to increase as compared with prior periods due to expanded selling and marketing efforts  continued product research and development and investments in administrative infrastructure to support subscription sales that we will recognize as revenue in subsequent periods 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
when a purchase decision is made  customers enter into a subscription agreement  which is generally  or months in duration and for a fixed number of users 
we promptly invoice customers for the full amount of their subscriptions at the time a subscription is activated 
payment is due for 
table of contents the full term of the subscription generally within days of the invoice 
we recognize revenue on a monthly straight line basis over the term of the subscription agreement 
we record amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue as deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
upon expiration of the subscription  customers who wish to re subscribe typically must do so at then current rates to continue using websense enterprise 
our revenue is significantly influenced by subscription renewals  and a decrease in subscription renewals amounts could negatively impact our revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
deferred tax assets 
as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  we recognize tax assets on the balance sheet if it is more likely than not that they will be realized on future tax returns 
at december   we had provided a full valuation allowance against accumulated deferred tax assets of million  reflecting the uncertainty associated with our future profitability 
during  we reassessed the valuation allowance previously established against us deferred tax assets 
factors considered by us included our earnings history  projected earnings based on current operations  and projected future taxable income in excess of stock option deductions 
based on this evidence  we concluded that it is more likely than not that the us deferred tax assets would be realized 
accordingly  we released the full valuation allowance of million  which resulted in an income tax benefit of approximately million 
the remaining million was credited to additional paid in capital as it related to the tax benefit of stock option deductions 
however  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged against income in the period such determination was made 
as of december   we had million in deferred tax assets 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for an explanation of our deferred tax assets 
results of operations the following table summarizes our operating results as a percentage of total revenues for each of the periods shown 
years ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses selling and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of stock based compensation total operating expenses income loss from operations other income  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss 
table of contents years ended december  and revenue revenue increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily a result of the addition of new customers 
approximately of subscription revenue recognized in was derived from sales to first time customers  who initially purchased one  two  or three year subscriptions to websense enterprise in or prior years 
the remaining of subscription revenue was generated from renewal business with existing customers 
we expect revenue to grow at a slower rate in than we did in  principally as a result of the larger revenue base at year end compared with year end and declining global economic factors 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists of the costs of content review  technical support and infrastructure costs associated with maintaining our databases 
cost of revenue increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to the costs associated with additional personnel in our technical support group 
we expect cost of revenue to increase in the future as we support the growth and maintenance of our databases as well as the technical support needs of our customers 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue decreased from in to in this decrease was primarily due to benefits derived from the automation of database search and support processes as well as the leveraging of database and technical support costs over a larger revenue base 
we expect that cost of revenue  as a percentage of revenue  will remain below of revenue for the foreseeable future 
gross margin gross margin increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to increased revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  gross margin increased from in to in this increase was primarily due to benefits derived from the automation of database search and support processes as well as the leveraging of database and technical support costs over a larger revenue base 
we expect that gross margin  as a percentage of revenue  will remain in excess of of revenue for the foreseeable future 
operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and benefits related to personnel engaged in selling  marketing and customer support functions  along with costs related to public relations  investor relations  advertising  promotions and travel as well as allocated facilities costs and depreciation expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in the increase in selling and marketing expenses of million was primarily due to increased headcount costs and increased advertising and promotional activities in north america  europe and asia 
we expect selling and marketing expenses to increase in the future as more personnel are added to support our expanding selling and marketing efforts worldwide 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software developers  contract programmers  allocated facilities costs and equipment depreciation 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in the increase of million in research and development expenses was primarily a result of personnel and consultants added since to support our expanded list of technology partners  enhancements of websense enterprise  including the development of websense enterprise version  and additional products 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in the future  as more personnel are added to support additional technology partners  enhancements of websense enterprise and expansion of our product offerings 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related expenses for our executive  finance  human resources and administrative personnel  third party professional service fees and allocated facilities and depreciation expenses 
general and administrative 
table of contents expenses increased from million in to million in the million increase in general and administrative expenses in is primarily due to the addition of personnel to support our growing operations  both domestically and internationally  higher state sales tax expenses  higher foreign income tax consulting expenses  as well as higher infrastructure costs in europe 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods  reflecting growth in operations and increasing expenses associated with being a public company and expansion of our international operations 
amortization of stock based compensation 
amortization of stock based compensation decreased from  in to  in the decrease in the amortization expense in is primarily resulting from the accelerated method of amortization used that resulted in higher expense in as compared with we expect amortization of stock based compensation to decrease in future periods as a result of using the accelerated method of amortization 
other income  net net other income decreased from million in to million in the decrease is due primarily to lower interest income due to lower interest rates earned by our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities despite increased balances as of december  as compared with december  provision for income taxes in  provision for income taxes of  related to our wholly owned subsidiary in the united kingdom 
during  we recorded an income tax benefit of  primarily attributable to the release of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
our provision for income taxes includes income taxes related to our wholly owned subsidiaries in the united kingdom  japan and australia as well as several domestic state income taxes 
the release of our valuation allowance offset these taxes as well as the provision for federal and california income taxes 
the result was a net benefit of  and an effective benefit rate of for we expect an effective tax rate of in as a result of the full utilization of our deferred tax assets in subsequent to  we anticipate that our effective tax rate may decrease over time due to benefits derived from lower tax rates associated with foreign income 
years ended december  and revenue revenue increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily a result of the addition of new customers 
approximately of subscription revenue recognized in was derived from sales to first time customers  who initially purchased one  two  or three year subscriptions to websense enterprise in or prior years 
the remaining of subscription revenue was generated from renewal business with existing customers 
cost of revenue cost of revenue increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to the costs associated with additional personnel in our database and technical support groups 
cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased to in from in the decrease in the percentage of revenue was due to the increase in revenue and economies of scale achieved relative to the associated costs 
gross margin gross margin increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to increased revenue and  to a lesser extent  the leveraging of database and technical support costs over a larger revenue base 

table of contents operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in the increase in selling and marketing expenses in of million was primarily due to increased headcount costs  increased commission expenses resulting from increased sales of pre paid subscriptions also referred to as billings  and increased advertising and promotional activities in north america  europe and asia pacific 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in the increase of million in research and development expenses was primarily a result of personnel added in to support our expanding list of technology partners as well as the growing feature set of websense enterprise 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in the million increase in general and administrative expenses in was primarily due to increased professional service fees  increased personnel and facility costs related to our wholly owned subsidiary in the united kingdom  increased third party administrative and accounting costs related to our wholly owned international subsidiaries  and also included increased compensation costs for our executive officers  increased insurance premiums  increased bad debt expense and other increased costs associated with being a public company 
amortization of stock based compensation 
amortization of stock based compensation decreased from million in to  in the decrease in the amortization expense in was primarily due to the accelerated method of amortization used that resulted in higher expense in as compared with other income  net net other income increased from million in to million in the increase was due primarily to higher interest income 
the higher interest income was driven by larger invested balances resulting from the interest earned on the net proceeds from our initial public offering  which closed in march net proceeds were invested for months in as compared with months in  as well as investment of our positive operating cash flow 
provision for income taxes in  there was no provision for income taxes 
during  we incurred estimated income taxes of  related to our wholly owned subsidiary in the united kingdom 
we did not incur income taxes related to our operations in the united states due to the utilization of our deferred tax assets that we recorded in prior periods 
liquidity and capital resources from our inception through march  we financed our operations primarily through the sale of preferred equity securities 
in total  we raised approximately million  net of fees and expenses  through the sale of preferred equity securities 
in march  we closed our initial public offering with proceeds  net of underwriting fees and offering expenses  of approximately million 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and investments in marketable securities of million and an accumulated deficit of  net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared with million in and million in in  cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net income  which includes interest earnings on our invested cash  and an increase in our subscriptions which are initially recorded as deferred revenue 
in and  cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in our subscriptions and interest earnings on our invested cash 
our operating cash flow and 
table of contents revenue are significantly influenced by subscription renewals  and a decrease in subscription renewals would negatively impact our operating cash flow and revenue 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared with million in and million in the relative decrease in cash used in investing activities in is primarily due to maturities of marketable securities exceeding purchases of marketable securities 
the relative decrease in cash used in investing activities in is primarily due to purchases of marketable securities mainly using positive operating cash flow whereas we utilized the proceeds of our initial public offering in march as well as positive operating cash flow to purchase marketable securities during net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared with million in and million in cash provided by financing activities in and was primarily due to proceeds received from the exercise of stock options as well as the issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan 
cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to net proceeds of million from the completion in march of our initial public offering  reduced by the million repayment of our outstanding equipment financing notes payable in the second quarter of at december   existing or future letters of credit totaled  we have operating lease commitments of million in  million in  million in  million in and million in a significant majority of our operating lease commitments are related to our corporate headquarters lease  which was renewed in april the lease renewal incentives resulted in no rent payments in the third and fourth quarters of and escalating rent payments from to the rent expense related to our corporate headquarters lease renewal will be recorded monthly on a straight line basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents balances and investments in marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next months 
we intend to continue to invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in interest bearing  investment grade securities 
if existing cash is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
additional debt would result in increased expenses and could result in covenants that would restrict our operations 
we have not made arrangements to obtain additional financing and there is no assurance that financing  if required  will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
summarized quarterly data unaudited the following tables present unaudited quarterly financial information for the eight quarters ended december  we believe this information reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of such information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the following information in addition to other information in this report before you decide to purchase our common stock 
the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently deem to be material and that we believe are specific to our company and our industry 
if any of these or other risks actually occurs  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
because we expect to derive substantially all of our future revenue from subscription fees for websense enterprise  any failure of this product to satisfy customer demands or to achieve more widespread market acceptance will seriously harm our business 
substantially all of our revenue comes from subscriptions to websense enterprise and we expect this trend will continue for the foreseeable future 
as a result  if for any reason revenue from websense enterprise declines or does not grow as rapidly as we anticipate  our operating results and our business will be significantly impaired 
if websense enterprise fails to meet the needs of our existing and target customers  or if it does not compare favorably in price and performance to competing products  our growth will be limited 
many of our competitors are seeking to compete with us by aggressively reducing the price of their products 
websense enterprise may not achieve continued market acceptance 
our future financial performance also will depend  in part  on our ability to diversify our offerings by successfully developing  introducing and gaining customer acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of websense enterprise  including websense enterprise version which was released in march and add on application modules such as client application manager and bandwidth optimizer 
we may not be successful in achieving market acceptance of any new products that we develop or of enhanced versions of websense enterprise 
any failure or delay in diversifying our existing offerings could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents our future success depends on our existing customers renewing and purchasing additional subscriptions to websense enterprise 
our future success depends on achieving substantial revenue from customer renewals for subscriptions to websense enterprise 
subscriptions for websense enterprise typically have durations of  or months 
our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions upon expiration 
we may be unable to generate significant revenue from renewals 
in order to maintain our revenue we must be successful in selling renewal subscriptions 
our future success also depends on our ability to sell further subscriptions to existing customers in order to add additional seats within their respective organizations 
as a result  to increase our revenue we must sell our existing customers additional subscriptions for websense enterprise to get greater coverage of their workforces 
this may require increasingly costly sales efforts targeting senior management and other management personnel associated with our customers internet infrastructure 
we face increasing competition  which has placed pressure on our pricing and which could prevent us from increasing revenue or maintaining profitability 
in addition  we may face competition from better established companies that have significantly greater resources 
the market for our products is intensely competitive and is likely to become even more so in the future 
our current principal competitors frequently offer their products at a significantly lower price than websense enterprise  which has resulted in pricing pressures on sales of our product and potentially could result in the commoditization of employee internet management  or eim  products 
if we are unable to maintain the current pricing on sales of websense enterprise or increase our pricing in the future  our profitability could be negatively impacted 
in addition  pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales  reduced margins or the failure of websense enterprise to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our current principal competitors include companies offering network filtering products  such as surfcontrol plc  secure computing  symantec corporation  nh incorporated  e technologies  webwasher and elron software  inc  and companies offering network reporting products  such as netiq and wavecrest computing 
we also face current and potential competition from vendors of internet servers  operating systems and networking hardware  many of which now  or may in the future  develop and or bundle eim or other competitive products with their products 
we compete against  and expect increased competition from  anti virus software developers  traditional network management software developers and web management service providers 
as we introduce new products  such as client application manager and bandwidth optimizer  we may face new competition from companies offering quality of service solutions such as packeteer and companies with a direct presence on computer desktops such as microsoft 
if eim functions become standard features of internet related hardware or software  the demand for websense enterprise will decrease 
furthermore  even if websense enterprise provides greater functionality and is more effective than certain other competitive products  potential customers might accept this limited functionality in lieu of purchasing websense enterprise 
in addition  our own indirect sales channels may decide to develop or sell competing products instead of websense enterprise 
many of our potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages  such as greater name recognition and larger marketing budgets and resources  established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases  and substantially greater financial  technical and other resources 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards or customer requirements 
for all of the foregoing reasons  we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 

table of contents sales to customers outside the united states have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue  and we expect this trend to continue  which exposes us to risks inherent in international sales 
we market and sell our products outside the united states through value added resellers  distributors and other resellers 
international sales represented approximately of our total revenue in and approximately in  although international sales increased in absolute dollars in compared with as a key component of our business strategy  we intend to expand our international sales but  as evidenced by the recent decline of our international sales as a percentage of our total sales mix  success cannot be assured 
in addition to the risks associated with our domestic sales  our international sales are subject to the following risks dependence on foreign distributors and their sales channels  localization of our websense enterprise products and our products ability to properly categorize and filter web sites containing foreign languages  laws and business practices favoring local competitors  compliance with multiple  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  including tax laws and regulations  foreign currency fluctuations  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties  and regional economic and political conditions 
such factors could have a material adverse effect on our future international sales 
any further reduction in international sales  or our failure to further develop our international distribution channels  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our international revenue is currently denominated in us dollars 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of the us dollar and foreign currencies may make websense enterprise more expensive for international customers  which could harm our business 
we do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuation 
the market for our products continues to emerge  and if we are not successful in promoting awareness of the need for websense enterprise and of our websense brand  our growth may be limited 
based on our experience with potential customers  we believe that many corporations do not recognize or acknowledge the existence or scope of problems caused by employee misuse of the internet or of their computers 
in addition  there may be a time limited opportunity to achieve and maintain a significant share of the market for eim and our other products due in part to the emerging nature of these markets and the substantial resources available to our existing and potential competitors 
if employers do not recognize or acknowledge these problems  then the market for websense enterprise may develop more slowly than we expect  which could adversely affect our operating results 
developing and maintaining awareness of our websense brand is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future products 
furthermore  we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market develops 
successful promotion of our websense brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to develop reliable and useful products at competitive prices 
if we fail to successfully promote our websense brand  or if our expenses to promote and maintain our websense brand are greater than anticipated  our results of operations and financial condition could suffer 
because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for websense enterprise ratably over the term of the subscription  downturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our revenue 
we expect that nearly all of our revenue for the foreseeable future will come from subscriptions to websense enterprise 
upon execution of a subscription agreement  we invoice our customers for the full term of the subscription agreement 
we then recognize revenue from customers monthly over the terms of their 
table of contents subscription agreements which typically have durations of  or months 
as a result  a majority of the revenue we report in each quarter is deferred revenue from subscription agreements entered into and paid for during previous quarters 
because of this financial model  the revenue we report in any quarter or series of quarters may mask significant downturns in sales and the market acceptance of websense enterprise 
we may not be able to develop acceptable new products or enhancements to our existing products at a rate required by our rapidly changing market 
our future success depends on our ability to develop new products or enhancements to our existing products that keep pace with rapid technological developments and that address the changing needs of our customers 
although websense enterprise is designed to operate with a variety of network hardware and software platforms  we will need to continuously modify and enhance websense enterprise to keep pace with changes in internet related hardware  software  communication  browser and database technologies 
we may not be successful in either developing such products or timely introducing them to the market 
in addition  uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies  or modifications to existing platforms or technology  could increase our research and development expenses 
the failure of our products to operate effectively with the existing and future network platforms and technologies will limit or reduce the market for our products  result in customer dissatisfaction and seriously harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly  and these fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall 
our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past  and will likely vary in the future primarily as the result of fluctuations in our billings  revenues and operating expenses 
we expect that our operating expenses will increase substantially in the future as we expand our selling and marketing activities  increase our research and development efforts and hire additional personnel 
in addition  our operating expenses historically have fluctuated  and may continue to fluctuate in the future  as the result of the factors described below and elsewhere in this quarterly report concentration of marketing expenses for activities such as trade shows and advertising campaigns  concentration of general and administrative expenses  such as recruiting expenses and professional services fees  concentration of research and development costs  and concentration of expenses associated with commissions paid on sales of subscriptions to websense enterprise 
as a result  our results of operations may not meet the expectations of current or potential investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock may decline 
the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
the market price of our common stock has been and likely will continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors that are beyond our control  including announcements of technological innovations or new products or services by our competitors  demand for websense enterprise  including fluctuations in subscription renewals  fluctuations in revenue from our indirect sales channels  changes in the pricing policies of our competitors  and changes in government regulations 

table of contents in addition  the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to announcements of technological innovations or new products or services by us  changes in our pricing policies  quarterly variations in our revenues and operating expenses  and our technological capabilities to accommodate the future growth in our operations or our customers 
further  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price of the stock of many internet related companies  and that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
a number of publicly traded internet related companies have current market prices below their initial public offering prices 
market fluctuations such as these may seriously harm the market price of our common stock 
in the past  securities class action suits have been filed following periods of market volatility in the price of a company s securities 
if such an action were instituted  we would incur substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources  which would seriously harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we acquire any companies or technologies in the future  they could prove difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results 
we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies  services and technologies in the future 
we have not made any acquisitions or investments to date  and therefore our ability as an organization to make acquisitions or investments is unproven 
acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks  including difficulties in integrating operations  technologies  services and personnel  diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations  risk of entering new markets  potential loss of key employees  and inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs 
in addition  if we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities  our existing stockholders may be diluted which could affect the market price of our stock 
as a result  if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments  our business and prospects may be seriously harmed 
we must develop and expand our indirect sales channels to increase revenue and improve our operating results 
we currently sell a significant majority of our products indirectly 
we intend to continue to rely on our indirect sales channels for a significant majority of revenue 
we depend on our indirect sales channels  including value added resellers  distributors  and providers of managed internet services  to offer websense enterprise to a larger customer base than can be reached through a direct sales effort 
we will need to expand our existing relationships and enter into new relationships to increase our current and future market share and revenue 
we may be unable to maintain and expand our existing relationships or enter into new relationships on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we are unable to maintain and expand our existing relationships or enter into new relationships  we would lose customer introductions and co marketing benefits and our operating results could suffer 
our reliance on indirect sales channels could result in reduced revenue growth because we have little control over our value added resellers  distributors and original equipment manufacturers 
our indirect sales channels accounted for more than of our revenue in and for more than of our revenue in we anticipate that sales from our various indirect sales channels  including value 
table of contents added resellers  distributors  providers of managed internet services and others  will continue to account for a significant majority of our total revenue in future periods 
none of these parties is obligated to continue selling our products or to make any purchases from us 
our ability to generate increased revenue depends significantly upon the ability and willingness of our indirect sales channels to market and sell our products to organizations worldwide 
if they are unsuccessful in their efforts or are unwilling or unable to market and sell our new product offerings such as client application manager  our operating results will suffer 
we cannot control the level of effort these parties expend or the extent to which any of them will be successful in marketing and selling our products 
a number of our value added resellers and distributors have been adversely affected by the current global economic downturn and we believe that their financial difficulties may negatively impact their ability to sell and market websense enterprise 
some of our indirect sales channels also market and sell products that compete with websense enterprise or may decide to do so in the future 
we may not be able to prevent these parties from devoting greater resources to support our competitors products and or eliminating their efforts to sell websense enterprise 
we have a history of losses and  because we expect our operating expenses to increase in the future  we may not be able to maintain profitability 
in  we achieved profitability for the first time since prior to the third quarter of  we had experienced net losses in each of our previous fiscal quarters  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of  we may be unable to maintain profitability unless our revenue continues to increase at a greater rate than our operating expenses 
we currently expect our operating expenses to increase substantially  as we  among other things expand our domestic and international selling and marketing activities  expand our product offerings  increase our research and development efforts to upgrade our existing products and develop new products and technologies  develop and expand our proprietary database and systems  upgrade our operational and financial systems  procedures and controls  and hire additional personnel  including sales and marketing personnel  engineers and other technical staff 
we will need to increase our revenue to maintain profitability 
if we fail to increase revenue from subscription fees for websense enterprise  we may experience losses in future quarters 
if we continue to grow  we also may fail to accurately estimate and assess the associated increase in our operating expenses 
if our operating expenses exceed our expectations  our financial performance will be adversely affected 
we are an early stage company with an unproven business model  which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects 
we have only a limited operating history upon which to base an evaluation of our current business and future prospects 
we began offering our eim software in september  but only since may  when we released our first version of websense enterprise as a significant enhancement to our original product  have we directed a majority of our focus on this market 
we introduced websense enterprise version in march along with the add on application modules client application manager and bandwidth optimizer  and we have very little data concerning market acceptance of these new products 
as a result  the revenue and income potential of our business and our market are unproven  particularly with respect to client application manager which represents a new area of business from our traditional eim products 
in addition  we have very limited historical data with respect to subscription renewals because we sell subscriptions that range from one to three years in length and have been selling websense enterprise for five years 
further  because of our limited operating history and because the market for our products is relatively new and rapidly evolving  we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business 
we may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends  which could harm our business 
in making an investment decision 
table of contents with respect to our stock  you should carefully consider the risks  uncertainties and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as ours 
we may not be able to successfully address any or all of these risks 
failure to adequately do so could cause our business  results of operations and financial condition to suffer 
negative economic conditions in the united states and in the other countries and geographic areas in which we offer our products may negatively impact our ability to maintain profitability 
since  the united states and other international markets in which we offer our products have experienced a significant economic downturn 
in addition  the united states and other countries suffered significant acts of hostility and terror  and are now facing the threat of future acts of hostility 
these or similar acts in the future  as well as fears relating to the mere possibility of future acts of hostility  may increase or prolong the negative economic conditions 
the economic downturn may impact our ability to sustain profitability by negatively affecting demand for our products and services  decreasing the renewal rate of subscriptions by our existing customers  and decreasing the strength of our indirect sales channels 
in addition  the economic downturn may force companies to prioritize expenditures  and these companies may decide not to purchase our product in a slowing economy 
there can be no certainty as to the degree or severity of the duration of this downturn 
we also cannot predict the extent and timing of the impact of the economic downturn in the united states and in other countries and geographic regions in which we conduct our business 
any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and establish our websense brand 
intellectual property is critical to our success  and we rely upon trademark  copyright and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our websense brand 
any of our trademarks may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation 
we currently have no issued patents and may be unable to obtain patent protection in the future 
in addition  any issued patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages  or may be challenged by third parties 
furthermore  legal standards relating to the validity  enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain 
effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our products are available 
the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as united states laws  and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate 
as a result our means of protecting our proprietary technology and brands may not be adequate 
furthermore  despite our efforts  we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property  including the misappropriation or misuse of the content of our proprietary database of websites 
any such infringement or misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights 
the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents  trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights 
as the number of entrants into our market increases  the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us grows 
our technologies and products may not be able to withstand any third party claims or rights against their use 
any intellectual property claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle  and could divert management attention from executing our business plan 

table of contents our database categories and our process for classifying web sites and software applications within those categories are subjective  and we may not be able to categorize web sites and software applications in accordance with our customers expectations 
we may not succeed in accurately categorizing internet and application content to meet our customers expectations 
we rely upon a combination of automated filtering technology and human review to categorize web sites and software applications in our proprietary databases 
our customers may not agree with our determinations that particular web sites and software applications should be included or not included in specific categories of our databases 
in addition  it is possible that our filtering processes may place objectionable material in categories that are generally unrestricted by our users internet and computer access policies  which could result in employees having access to such material in the workplace 
any miscategorization could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our reputation 
furthermore  we select our categories based on content we believe employers want to manage 
we may not now  or in the future  succeed in properly identifying the categories of content that employers want to manage 
any failure to effectively categorize and filter web sites and software applications according to our customers expectations will impair the growth of our business and our efforts to increase brand acceptance 
our databases may fail to keep pace with the rapid growth and technological change of the internet 
the success of websense enterprise depends on the breadth and accuracy of our databases 
although our databases currently catalog more than four million web sites and  software applications  they contain only a fraction of the material available on the internet 
in addition  the total number of web sites and software applications is growing rapidly  and we expect this rapid growth rate to continue in the future 
our databases and database technologies may not be able to keep pace with the growth in the number of web sites and software applications  especially the growing amount of content utilizing foreign languages 
further  the ongoing evolution of the internet and computing environments will require us to continually improve the functionality  features and reliability of our databases 
because websense enterprise can only manage access to web sites and software applications included in our databases  if our databases do not contain a meaningful portion of relevant content  the effectiveness of websense enterprise will be significantly diminished 
any failure of our databases to keep pace with the rapid growth and technological change of the internet will impair the market acceptance of websense enterprise  which in turn will harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
future sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by our existing stockholders of large numbers of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur 
these sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 
our systems may be vulnerable to security risks or service disruptions that could harm our business 
although we have taken measures to secure our systems against security risks and other causes of disruption of electronic services  our servers are vulnerable to physical or electronic break ins and service disruptions  which could lead to interruptions  delays  loss of data or the inability to process customer requests 
such events could be very expensive to remedy  could damage our reputation and could discourage existing and potential customers from using our products 
we may experience break ins in the future 
any such events could substantially harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
because our products are complex and are deployed in a wide variety of complex network environments  they may have errors or defects that users identify after deployment  which could harm our reputation and our business 
in addition  products as complex as ours frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
we have from time to time found errors in versions of websense enterprise  and we may find such errors in the future  including in websense enterprise version  client application manager or bandwidth optimizer 
the occurrence of errors could adversely affect sales of 
table of contents our products  divert the attention of engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems 
evolving regulation of the internet may affect us adversely 
as internet commerce continues to evolve  increasing regulation by federal  state or foreign agencies becomes more likely 
such regulation is likely in the areas of user privacy  pricing  content and quality of products and services 
taxation of internet use or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the internet may also be imposed 
laws and regulations applying to the solicitation  collection or processing of personal or consumer information could affect our activities 
furthermore  any regulation imposing fees for internet use could result in a decline in the use of the internet and the viability of internet commerce  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the success of our business depends on the continued growth and acceptance of the internet as a business tool 
expansion in the sales of websense enterprise depends on the continued acceptance of the internet as a communications and commerce platform for enterprises 
the internet may not prove to be a viable commercial medium due to inadequate development of the necessary infrastructure  such as a reliable network backbone  or timely development of complementary products  such as high speed modems 
additionally  the internet could lose its viability as a business tool due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of internet activity  security  reliability  cost  ease of use  accessibility  and quality of service 
if the internet does not continue to become a widespread communications medium and commercial platform  the demand for websense enterprise could be significantly reduced  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our products create risks of potential negative publicity and legal liability 
because customers rely on websense enterprise to manage employee behavior  any significant defects or errors in our products may result in negative publicity or legal claims 
negative publicity or legal claims could seriously harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  websense enterprise s capability to report internet data retrieval requests and software application execution requests along with the workstations from which they originated may result in negative publicity or legal claims based on potential privacy violations 
we are dependent on our management team  and the loss of any key member of this team may prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner 
our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key management and development personnel 
we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing engineering personnel because of the complexity of our products and technologies 
we do not have employment agreements with a majority of our executive officers  key management or development personnel and  therefore  they could terminate their employment with us at any time without penalty 
we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
the loss of one or more of our key employees could seriously harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in such an event we may be unable to recruit personnel to replace these individuals in a timely manner  or at all  on acceptable terms 
our growth could strain our personnel and infrastructure resources  and if we are unable to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage our growth  we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan 

table of contents we are currently experiencing a period of rapid growth in our operations  which has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on our management  administrative  operational and financial infrastructure 
our future success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage growth effectively 
this will require us to hire and train additional personnel to manage our expanding operations 
in addition  we will be required to continue to improve our operational  financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures 
if we fail to successfully manage our growth  we will be unable to execute our business plan 
because competition for our target employees is intense  we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth 
to execute our growth plan  we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
we need to hire additional personnel in virtually all operational areas  including selling and marketing  research and development  operations and technical support  customer service and administration 
competition for these personnel is intense  especially for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and internet related products 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
we have from time to time in the past experienced  and we expect to continue to experience in the future  difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications 
many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have 
if we fail to attract new personnel or retain and motivate our current personnel  our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed 
it may be difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as some provisions of delaware law  may discourage  delay or prevent third parties from acquiring us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
for example  our certificate of incorporation provides for a classified board  with each board member serving a staggered three year term 
it also provides that stockholders may not fill board vacancies  call stockholder meetings or act by written consent 
our bylaws further provide that advance written notice is required prior to stockholder proposals 
each of these provisions makes it more difficult for stockholders to obtain control of our board or initiate actions that are opposed by the then current board 
additionally  we have authorized preferred stock that is undesignated  making it possible for the board to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights and preferences that could impede the success of any attempted change of control 
delaware law also could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
section of the delaware general corporation law may have an anti takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board  including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price of the shares of common stock held by our stockholders 
we do not intend to pay dividends 
we have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock since we have been a publicly traded company 
we currently intend to retain any future cash flows from operations to fund growth and  therefore  do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures are related to our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments  commercial paper  corporate bonds  and mortgage backed securities 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our short term available for sale investments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at december  declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income 
we mitigate our foreign currency risks principally by contracting primarily in us dollars and maintaining only nominal foreign currency cash balances 
working funds necessary to facilitate the short term operations of our subsidiaries are kept in the local currencies in which they do business 
for the year ended december   all of our billings  including those billed by our operations in ireland  were denominated in our functional currency  which is the us dollar
