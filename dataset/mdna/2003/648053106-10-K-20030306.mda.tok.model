item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of all majority owned subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize rental revenue on a straight line basis  which averages minimum rents over the terms of the leases 
the cumulative difference between lease revenue recognized under this method and contractual lease payment terms is recorded as deferred rent receivable  and is included in trade receivables in our consolidated balance sheets 
certain leases provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee 
percentage rents are recorded once the required sales level is achieved 
leases also typically provide for tenant reimbursements of common area maintenance and other operating expenses 
rental income also includes lease termination fees 
we must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables related to base rents  expense reimbursements and other revenue or income 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
these estimates have a direct impact on our net income  because a higher bad debt reserve results in less net income 
the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition provides guidance on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states to selected revenue recognition issues 
we have concluded that our revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and sab no 
real estate we record land  buildings and building and tenant improvements at cost and they are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
major replacements and betterments  which improve or extend the life of the asset  are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives  ordinary repairs and maintenance  are expensed as incurred 
properties are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimated useful lives are as follows buildings to years building improvements to years tenant improvements the shorter of the term of the related lease or useful life we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income 
for example  if we were to lengthen the expected useful life of a particular building improvement  the improvement would be depreciated over a greater number of years  resulting in less depreciation expense and higher net income on an annual basis 
long lived assets on a periodic basis  we assess whether there are any indicators that the value of the real estate properties may be impaired 
a property s value is impaired only if our estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by the property taking into account the anticipated holding period of the asset is less than the carrying value of the property 
such cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property 
when we identify assets as held for sale  we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the sales price  net of selling costs of such assets 
if  in our opinion  the net sales price of the assets which we have identified for sale is less than the net book value of the assets  a valuation allowance is established 
for investments accounted for under the equity method  a loss is recognized if the loss in value of the investment is other than temporary 
when we make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of our real estate properties  we have a direct impact on our net income  because taking an impairment results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
recently issued accounting standards in january  fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  fin an interpretation of abr fin provides guidance on identifying entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights  variable interest entities vie  and how to determine when and which business enterprises should consolidate the vie

funds from operations funds from operations ffo is a widely used performance measure for real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure of operating performance to net income calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we calculate ffo in accordance with the best practices described in the april national policy bulletin of the national association of real estate investment trusts the white paper 
the white paper defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
given the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator  we believe that ffo is helpful to investors as a measure of our operational performance because it excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance such as various non recurring items  gains and losses on sales of real estate and real estate related depreciation and amortization  which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult to compare 
ffo should not  however  be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance  is not an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  and is not indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make distributions 
our computation of ffo may differ from the methodology utilized by other equity reits to calculate ffo and  therefore  may not be comparable to such other reits 
the following information is provided to reconcile net income  the most comparable gaap number  to ffo  and to show the items included in our ffo for the past periods indicated in thousands year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  net income before extraordinary item add depreciation and amortization continuing operations real estate assets discontinued operations real estate assets impairment of real estate impairment of real estate impairment of real estate held for sale deduct preferred a dividends preferred b dividends preferred d dividends gains loss on sale of real estate gain on sale of discontinued operations funds from operations basic add preferred a dividends minority interest in income of consolidated partnership funds from operations diluted net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities weighted average of common shares outstanding diluted note preferred a shares have a dilutive effect for ffo calculations 
on july   we redeemed all preferred a shares outstanding  resulting in the issuance of approximately million shares of common stock 
includes pro rata share of joint venture projects 
excludes gain loss on sale of land 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million in available cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our taxable income to our stockholders on an annual basis 
therefore  as a general matter  it is unlikely that we will have any substantial cash balances that could be used to meet our liquidity needs 
instead  our liquidity needs must be met from cash generated from operations and external sources of capital 
short term liquidity needs our short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for operating and other expenses directly associated with our portfolio of properties including regular maintenance items  interest expense and scheduled principal payments on our outstanding debt  capital expenditures incurred to facilitate the leasing of space eg  tenant improvements and leasing commissions  and quarterly dividends and distributions that we pay to our common and preferred stockholders and holders of partnership units in a partnership that we control 
historically  we have satisfied these requirements principally through cash generated from operations 
we believe that cash generated from operations and borrowings under our fleet revolving facility will be sufficient to meet our short term liquidity requirements  however  there are certain factors that may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from tenants under existing leases at our properties 
therefore  our operating cash flow is dependent on the rents that we are able to charge to our tenants  and the ability of these tenants to make their rental payments 
we believe that the nature of the properties in which we typically invest primarily community and neighborhood shopping centers provides a more stable revenue flow in uncertain economic times  in that consumers still need to purchase basic living essentials such as food and soft goods  even in difficult economic times 
however  general economic downturns  or economic downturns in one or more markets in which we own properties  still may adversely impact the ability of our tenants to make lease payments and our ability to re lease space on favorable terms as leases expire 
in either of these instances  our cash flow could be adversely affected 
the current economic downturn in the united states has had an adverse effect on our performance thus far 
a continuation of the current downturn could continue to negatively impact our operating results in  depending on the magnitude and length of the downturn 
on january   kmart corporation  our second largest tenant  filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy laws 
since the bankruptcy filing leases at seven locations where kmart is our lessee were rejected  kmart indicated that it intends to close six additional locations at our properties on or about march   and we entered into agreements with kmart to reduce rent at four of our store locations effective july  and at six of our other store locations effective april   however  two of the store locations where rent reductions were effective july  are included in the six store locations scheduled to close on or about march   resulting in eight store locations where we have agreed to rent reductions 
as of december   kmart was our lessee at locations excluding the seven previously rejected locations that contain a total of million square feet of gross leasable area  or approximately of our total gross leasable area 
as of december   kmart s annualized base rent for these locations was million  or approximately per square foot  not taking into account the rental reductions agreed to at the six locations effective april   which are not material 
in january  kmart formally rejected one lease where designation rights had previously been assigned 
under federal bankruptcy laws  kmart can reject the six leases at the locations scheduled to close on or about march   as well as the remaining leases that we have with kmart 
it could also seek to receive rent reductions or deferrals or other lease modifications 
we have no information at this time as to kmart s plans for the remaining leases 
the delay or failure of kmart to make payments under its leases  or the rejection by kmart of a substantial number of leases with us under federal bankruptcy laws  would adversely impact our performance  which impact could be material 
in the event that leases are terminated  we would seek to re lease those spaces to new tenants 
in some cases  we believe we could re lease the space currently occupied by kmart on terms that would be at least as favorable as the current lease with kmart 
in other cases  however  we may not be able to achieve the rental rates that kmart is currently paying 
it may also take a significant amount of time to re lease any space vacated by kmart during which period we would not be collecting any rent for that space 
in addition  kmart s termination of leases or closure of stores could result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases  the impact of which could be material to us 
we are not currently aware of any pending tenant bankruptcies that are likely to materially affect our rental revenues 
in december  we completed the eig acquisition  which increased the net rentable area of our properties by more than 
as a result of this acquisition  we will incur substantial  additional expenses that are attributable to the operation of these properties 
we also assumed or incurred approximately million of additional debt to finance the transaction 
subsequently  in connection with the sale of four of our factory outlet centers  we repaid approximately million of this debt 
while we believe that the cash generated by these newly acquired properties will more than offset the operating and interest expenses associated with these properties  it is possible that these properties may not perform as well as expected and as a result  our cash needs may increase 
in addition  there may be other costs incurred as a result of the acquisition of these properties  including increased general and administrative costs while we assimilate such a large number of properties into our operating system 
we spent approximately million in to complete our million deferred maintenance program that began in we believe that completing this maintenance enhanced the competitiveness of our properties 
we also completed redevelopment projects in  the aggregate cost of which including costs incurred in prior years on these projects was approximately million 
our current pipeline is comprised of an additional redevelopment projects  including community and neighborhood shopping centers and one enclosed regional mall project  the aggregate cost of which including costs incurred in prior years on these projects is expected to be approximately million 
we also regularly incur significant expenditures in connection with the re leasing of our retail space  principally in the form of tenant improvements and leasing commissions 
the amounts of these expenditures can vary significantly  depending on negotiations with tenants and the willingness of tenants to pay higher base rents over the life of the leases 
we expect to pay for these capital expenditures out of excess cash from operations or  to the extent necessary  draws on our revolving credit facilities 
we believe that a significant portion of these expenditures is recouped in the form of continuing lease payments 
we have established a stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to million of our outstanding common stock through periodic open market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions 
as of december   we had repurchased approximately  shares under this program at an average purchase price of per share 
we repurchased approximately  shares in at an average purchase price of per share 
in light of the current trading price of our common stock  we do not anticipate effecting additional stock repurchases in the near future  although we could reevaluate this determination at any time based on market conditions 
we have also established a repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to million of our outstanding preferred stock and public debt through periodic open market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions 
as of december   no purchases had been made under this program 
on july   we redeemed all outstanding shares of our series a cumulative convertible preferred stock 
each share of series a stock was redeemed for shares of common stock  and resulted in the issuance of approximately million shares of common stock at an equivalent price of per share 
the redemption occurred at a discount to the carrying value of the preferred stock aggregating approximately million based on the shares we redeemed at the closing price of the common stock at redemption 
this discount has been reflected as an adjustment to earnings attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december  the current quarterly dividend on our common stock is per share 
we also pay regular quarterly dividends on our preferred stock 
the maintenance of these dividends is subject to various factors  including the discretion of our board of directors  our ability to pay dividends under maryland law  the availability of cash to make the necessary dividend payments and the effect of reit distribution requirements  which require at least of our taxable income to be distributed to stockholders 
we also make regular quarterly distributions on units in a partnership that we control 
in addition  under our existing credit facilities  we are restricted from paying common stock dividends that would exceed of our funds from operations during any four quarter period 
long term liquidity needs our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the principal amount of our long term debt as it matures  significant non recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically at our properties  redevelopment projects that we undertake at our properties and the costs associated with acquisitions of properties that we pursue 
historically  we have satisfied these requirements principally through the most advantageous source of capital at the time  which has included the incurrence of new debt through borrowings through public offerings of unsecured debt and private incurrence of secured and unsecured debt  sales of common and preferred stock  capital raised through the disposition of assets  repayment by third parties of notes receivable and joint venture capital transactions 
we believe that these sources of capital will continue to be available in the future to fund our long term capital needs  however  there are certain factors that may have a material adverse effect on our access to these capital sources 
our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including our degree of leverage  the value of our unencumbered assets  our credit rating and borrowing restrictions imposed by existing lenders 
currently  we have investment grade credit ratings for prospective unsecured debt offerings from two major rating agencies standard poor s bbb and moody s investor service baa 
a downgrade in outlook or rating by a rating agency can occur at any time if the agency perceives an adverse change in our financial condition  results of operations or ability to service debt 
if such a downgrade occurs  it would increase the interest rate currently payable under our existing credit facilities  it likely would increase the costs associated with obtaining future financing  and it potentially could adversely affect our ability to obtain future financing 
based on an internal evaluation  the estimated value of our properties is well above the outstanding amount of mortgage debt encumbering the properties 
therefore  at this time  we believe that additional financing could be obtained  either in the form of mortgage debt or additional unsecured borrowings  and without violating the financial covenants contained in our unsecured debt agreements 
in  we entered into the fleet revolving facility  issued million of senior unsecured notes in a public offering and increased the fleet term loan from million to million 
our ability to raise funds through sales of common stock and preferred stock is dependent on  among other things  general market conditions for reits  market perceptions about our company and the current trading price of our stock 
in january  we sold million shares of common stock in a public offering that raised net proceeds of approximately million 
we will continue to analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any particular point in time  but the equity markets may not be consistently available on terms that are attractive 
we have selectively effected asset sales to generate cash proceeds over the last two years 
in particular  in december we sold four of our factory outlet centers and generated gross proceeds of approximately million 
in september we sold our portfolio of garden apartment properties and generated gross proceeds of approximately million 
in and  we also sold other assets and generated proceeds from certain of our joint venture projects and notes receivable that raised an additional and million in gross proceeds  respectively 
our ability to generate cash from asset sales is limited by market conditions and certain rules applicable to reits 
our ability to sell properties in the future to raise cash will necessarily be limited if market conditions make such sales unattractive 
the following table summarizes all of our long term contractual cash obligations  excluding interest  to pay third parties as of december  in thousands contractual cash obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total long term debt includes scheduled amortization and scheduled maturities for mortgage loans  notes payable including notes payable  other and credit facilities 
as described elsewhere  in november  we increased the borrowing base of our fleet term loan by million and extended the maturity date until december  the additional borrowings under this facility were used to pay down a portion of the balance outstanding under the fleet revolving facility 
in january  we repaid our notes payable  other with deposits held in escrow 
on march   we repaid million of mortgage indebtedness that was to mature in july through borrowings under the fleet revolving facility 
we intend to repay million issued under our medium term note program that matures in november and the balance outstanding under the fleet term loan that matures in december either through draws under the fleet revolving facility or from the proceeds generated through the issuance of public or private secured or unsecured debt or a combination thereof 
we anticipate repaying the million of other mortgage loans due in and the balance of the long term debt obligations  which consist primarily of scheduled amortization  through draws under the fleet revolving facility 
the following table summarizes certain terms of our senior unsecured credit facilities as of december  loan amount available to be drawn in thousands amount drawn as of december  in thousands current interest rate maturity date fleet term loan libor plus bp december fleet revolving facility libor plus bp april total we incur interest using a day libor rate  which was at december  the fleet revolving facility and the fleet term loan require that we maintain certain financial coverage ratios 
these coverage ratios currently include net operating income of unencumbered assets to interest on unsecured debt ratio of at least ebitda to fixed charges ratio of at least minimum tangible net worth of approximately billion total debt to total adjusted assets of no more than total secured debt to total adjusted assets of no more than unsecured debt to unencumbered assets value ratio of no more than book value of ancillary assets to total adjusted assets of no more than book value of new construction assets to total adjusted assets of no more than ffo payout ratio no greater than under the terms of each of the fleet term loan and the fleet revolving facility  the respective covenants will be modified to be consistent with any more restrictive covenant contained in any other existing or new senior unsecured credit facility that we enter into 
we have also issued approximately million of indebtedness under three public indentures 
these indentures also contain covenants that require us to maintain certain financial coverage ratios 
these covenants are generally less onerous than the covenants contained in our senior unsecured credit facilities  as described above 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants under our existing credit facilities and public indentures  and we believe that we will continue to remain in compliance with these covenants 
however  if our properties do not perform as expected  or if unexpected events occur that require us to borrow additional funds  compliance with these covenants may become difficult and may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives 
in addition  these financial covenants may restrict our ability to pursue particular acquisition transactions for example  acquiring a portfolio of properties that is highly leveraged and could significantly impact our ability to pursue growth initiatives 
in addition to our existing credit facilities and public indebtedness  we had approximately million of mortgage debt outstanding as of december   having a weighted average interest rate of per annum  and million of notes payable with a weighted average interest rate of per annum 
joint ventures in a few cases  we have made commitments to provide funds to joint ventures under certain circumstances 
the liabilities associated with these joint ventures do not show up as liabilities on our financial statements

as of december   the aggregate book value of our investment in these joint ventures was approximately million 
phase under the terms of this joint venture  we have a interest in the venture that owns the community shopping center 
our ownership interest was reduced to from on november  when a us partnership comprised substantially of foreign investors purchased a interest in the joint venture

as of december   the book value of our investment in the vail ranch ii joint venture was approximately million 
other funding obligations in addition to the joint venture obligations described above  we also had the following contingent contractual obligations as of december   none of which we believe will materially adversely affect us letter of credit extension 
in connection with the sale of our garden apartment portfolio  we arranged for the provision of a letter of credit to the buyer in the amount of approximately million  which can remain outstanding through september subject to extensions for up to one year 
the letter of credit was used by the buyer as collateral for a loan obtained to finance the purchase of the garden apartment portfolio 
if the letter of credit is drawn for example  following a default by the buyer under the loan  we will be obligated to reimburse the providing bank for the amount of the draw 
the balance outstanding and thus the maximum amount of exposure under this letter of credit was approximately million as of december   however  as of december   approximately million of this balance was secured by funds held in escrow 
these funds reduced our exposure under the letter of credit to approximately million 
non recourse debt guarantees 
under certain of our non recourse loans and those of our joint ventures  we could  under certain circumstances  be responsible for portions of the mortgage indebtedness in connection with certain customary non recourse carve out provisions such as environmental conditions  misuse of funds and material misrepresentations 
as of december   we had mortgage loans outstanding of approximately million and our joint ventures had mortgage loans outstanding of approximately million 
leasing commitments 
we have entered into leases  as lessee  in connection with ground leases for shopping centers which we operate  an office building which we sublet  and our administrative office space 
these leases are accounted for as operating leases 
the minimum annual rental commitments during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are approximately as follows in thousands year thereafter for a discussion of other factors which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources  please see the section titled risk factors in item i of this annual report on form k 
inflation the majority of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
these provisions enable us to receive percentage rents  which generally increase as prices rise but may be adversely impacted by tenant sales decreases  and or escalation clauses which are typically related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
in addition  we believe that many of our existing lease rates are below current market levels for comparable space and that upon renewal or re rental these rates may be increased to match  or get closer to  current market rates 
this belief is based upon an analysis of relevant market conditions  including a comparison of comparable market rental rates  and upon the fact that many of our leases have been in place for a number of years and may not contain escalation clauses sufficient to match the increase in market rental rates over such time 
most of our leases require the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  we periodically evaluate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  and may enter into interest rate protection agreements which mitigate  but do not eliminate  the effect of changes in interest rates on floating rate loans 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding floating rate mortgages 
we also had approximately million outstanding under floating rate credit facilities 
we do not believe that the interest rate risk represented by our floating rate debt is material as of december   in relation to our billion of outstanding total debt  our billion of total assets and the billion total market capitalization as of that date 
in addition  as discussed below  we have fixed million of floating rate borrowings through the use of two hedging agreements 
we have entered into two hedging agreements a cap agreement which reduces our interest rate exposure  and a reverse arrears swap agreement under which we will receive the difference between the fixed rate of the swap   and the floating rate option  which is the six month libor rate  in arrears 
hedging agreements enable us to convert floating rate liabilities into fixed rate liabilities 
however  hedging agreements expose us to the risk that the counterparties to these agreements may not perform  which could increase our exposure to rising interest rates 
generally  the counterparties to hedging agreements that we enter into are major financial institutions 
we may borrow additional money with floating interest rates in the future 
increases in interest rates  or the loss of the benefit of existing or future hedging agreements  would increase our expense  which would adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt 
future increases in interest rates will increase our interest expense as compared to the fixed rate debt underlying our hedging agreements and we could be required to make payments to unwind such agreements 
if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increase by  the increase in annual interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt decrease by  the decrease in interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
this assumes that the amount outstanding under our variable rate debt remains at approximately million  the balance as of december  if market rates of interest increase by  the fair value of our total outstanding debt would decrease by approximately million 
if market rates of interest decreased by  the fair value of our total outstanding debt would increase by approximately million 
this assumes that our total outstanding debt remains at billion  the balance as of december
