item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and the audited consolidated financial statements of the company included in this report 
recent developments home healthcare industry events updates during fiscal  a number of state legislatures were in session dealing with record budget deficits and contemplating cuts to medicaid funding  some of which  if enacted  would reduce reimbursement levels for services provided by the company 
as is typically the case  many of the original proposals highlighted in the media were substantially modified either in committee or in the general sessions of the various legislatures 
as of the date of this filing  the company is not aware of any enacted state changes that would have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial or liquidity position  however  some states are still considering rate or volume reductions which  if enacted could have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial or liquidity position 
in an effort to impact these legislative issues  the company has engaged consultants in selected markets to directly present the company s cost saving strategies and related rate requests to the medicaid program 
as of the date of this filing  the company has received positive indications from one state medicaid commissioner to consider its reimbursement rate request 
in addition  the company has begun negotiations with another state medicaid commissioner to pilot a program to more rapidly discharge hospitalized medically complex and medically fragile children into the company s care 
these accelerated discharges should provide the state with significant cost savings and potentially motivate the state to increase the reimbursement rate for services provided by the company 
in addition  the company s local market staff routinely collaborate with the appropriate community and regulatory authorities on behalf of the company and its patients 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of the act  passed by congress in november and signed into law in december  represents an important change to medicare 
while the more immediately visible changes mandated by the act relate to extension of the medicare benefit to prescription drug coverage  other aspects may impact the operations and profitability of health care providers  including the company

hipaa s standard transaction in data set rules mandate that covered entities  including the company  transmit claims and certain related healthcare information in standardized formats and data sets 
compliance was required on october   but many payors  including most state medicaid agencies  were not in compliance by that date 
most medicaid agencies are running dual systems to accommodate hipaa compliant transactions as well as non compliant transactions 
some states  however  are running only hipaa compliant systems and other states are not yet hipaa compliant 
there is uncertainty as to when those states using dual systems will discontinue their non hipaa compliant systems 
these uncertainties surrounding claims processing as a result of hipaa s standard transaction and code set rules  which uncertainties are outside of the control of the company  could result in delayed reimbursement by some payors  including medicaid agencies  and could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position 
in addition  a few states are experiencing internal problems with the administration of their medicaid programs  which are temporarily disrupting payments of claims for services rendered by the company 
one of the states encountered three missed deadlines by its contractor for implementation of a new computer system designed to standardize its technology platform and facilitate faster claims payment 
as a result  the state chose to make progress payments to providers without assigning those payments to specific claims for services rendered 
the company received some payment application instructions  however  the reconciliation of those payments is ongoing 

table of contents company events updates during fiscal  the company appointed dr 
susan j 
kelley to serve as a member of the company s board of directors in the class iii membership group 
in october  the company appointed mr 
david crane to serve as a member of the board of directors in the class ii membership group 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company hired mr 
ken wilson as vice president for sales and marketing 
mr 
wilson s leadership will further develop the company s sales capabilities as the company implements its market matrix approach to home healthcare services 
his experience in negotiating contracts with managed care payors should help the company strengthen its contract portfolio and aggressively pursue patient referrals from these covered lives 
the audit committee recently engaged a national accounting firm to review its current internal audit department and perform an independent assessment of the internal audit function 
the purpose of this assessment is to benchmark the scope of the company s audit program against other healthcare providers and refine the findings resolution process 
this report should be delivered to the audit committee in the second quarter of fiscal during fiscal  the company acquired the pennsylvania assets of health med one  inc  a pennsylvania corporation doing business as advanced health care  for a purchase price of million in cash 
the acquisition included advanced health care s pediatric private duty nursing facilities in york  harrisburg  allentown and philadelphia  pennsylvania 
revenues from these locations are estimated to exceed million annually 
during fiscal  the company opened a new pilot ppec in raleigh  north carolina 
the company believes this ppec will be an important step in establishing the ppec concept in the state of north carolina  where the company owns and operates seven private duty nursing locations as well as pharmacy and respiratory businesses 
the company believes that the potential exists to create a statewide network of centers in north carolina and may use this relationship model in other states as well 
on july   the company announced the opening of two branch offices  to provide home medical equipment primarily for infants and children  in san antonio  tx and chesapeake  va 
during fiscal  the company repurchased million of its senior subordinated notes due the notes 
the notes were repurchased in private transactions for approximately million cash  plus accrued interest 
the gain net of the write off of the related deferred financing fees of approximately million is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
the aggregate principal amount of the notes outstanding as of the date of this filing is million 
during fiscal  the company engaged a financial advisor to review capital structure alternatives necessary to support the company s growth plans 
these alternatives include recapitalization of its debt obligations to take advantage of potential interest rate arbitrage opportunities and financing of potential acquisitions 
the company has obtained a financing commitment and is presently negotiating the terms of a definitive credit agreement with a potential lender 
however  there is no assurance that the negotiations will result in the completion of a new credit facility 
during fiscal  as a result of a field audit by a medicare carrier  the company was notified of an asserted claim for recoupment of approximately million of accounts receivable 
the carrier claimed that incomplete clinical documentation was contained in the patients medical records to substantiate the payments for the services provided 
the company has investigated the assertion and has determined that the alleged insufficiency relates to information that is required to be maintained in the patient s medical record 
during january  the medicare carrier notified the company that it had begun recoupment of million under audit against weekly disbursements made to the company 
as of april   the company was 
table of contents notified by a representative of the medicare carrier that upon further review a significant number of the patients contained in the original audit sample were deemed to have sufficient medical documentation and would be excluded from their reported findings 
this revised the recoupment to million plus accrued interest 
medicare has recouped this amount as of september  among the issues under examination was the company s compliance with a local medical review policy lmrp requiring a specific type of documentation to be included in the patient s medical record 
as of april   the medicare carrier rescinded the lmrp 
while this action does not directly affect the audit sample  which pre dates the rescission of the lmrp  the company believes that arguments it intends to cite on appeal regarding the validity of the lmrp may be bolstered by the elimination of this requirement  however  the ultimate resolution of this issue as it pertains to the company cannot be predicted at this time 
the company continues to believe that its documentation for substantially all the remaining patients in the audit sample is sufficient 
at this time  the company believes that a repayment of some amount is probable 
the company s estimate of the liability is based upon the status of its review to date  and the settlement of similar claims made against other home health care providers 
based upon this estimate  the company accrued a million liability reflected in the consolidated financial statements for fiscal the ultimate resolution of this asserted claim may be different from the current estimate and could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial or liquidity position 
management will continue to assess its various growth opportunities  ranging from evaluation of acquisition alternatives in key markets  geographical expansion through the use of start up branch offices  marketing initiatives impact on existing branch office growth  and technology improvements in order to ration capital available from operations 
risk management on october   the company completed its annual renewal of its risk management program and implemented several changes 
the company renewed its insurance program for medical malpractice  commercial and general liability coverage with arch specialty insurance company  rated a by am best company 
per claim deductible limits remained at million 
the annual aggregate limit changed from no annual aggregate to million 
the policy amount increased from million to million with a significant increase in annual premiums 
the company has hired a full time risk manager with extensive homecare nursing and occupational medicine experience to strengthen the initial incident reporting and investigation process 
the company expects these process refinements to positively influence claim adjustment activities and ultimately  loss history 
the company s risk committee continues to monitor incident reporting and claim adjustment activity  reviews existing patient census and discharges high risk cases where legally permissible 
the company continues to educate location staff on risk management procedures including appropriate nurse staffing decisions 
the company s third party actuary has completed an analysis of the company s medical malpractice loss history and has quantified liability recognition under the new policy terms 
under the new medical malpractice policy  if the company s loss experience worsens it could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results and liquidity position 
during fiscal  the company renewed its directors  officers and corporate liability insurance policy d o 
due to the turbulent conditions in the d o market  the company chose to reduce the amount of coverage from a million limit to a million limit 
during november  the company was notified by its former workers compensation carrier of its intent to reduce its surety bond collateral requirement by approximately million 
the surety bond carrier has  in turn  decreased its cash collateral requirement and refunded to the company the same million 
material changes to the fiscal workers compensation policy included the claim deductible increasing from million to million 

table of contents operations the company has three reportable segments i nursing and ppec  ii respiratory therapy  equipment and services and iii pharmacy see note 
the company continues to experience downward pressure on its operating margins in two of the three segments 
in the nursing and ppec segment  increased business insurance costs and increased staffing costs at start up ppec centers contributed to lower margins in fiscal as compared to fiscal in the pharmacy segment  increased product acquisition costs and decreased reimbursements on select hemophilia factor products contributed to the lower margin rates in fiscal as compared to fiscal the company continues to monitor ongoing changes in the infusion drug delivery market and the alternatives available to various payors 
if some of these alternatives are selected by various payors  there could be significant reductions to the company s future pharmacy revenues 
in addition  the company remains exposed to significant revenue fluctuations as a result of changes in service or usage levels by a limited number of hemophilia factor patients 
the company is expanding its capability to distribute injectable medication nationally and continues to assess opportunities for these injectables in selected payor patient populations 
the company s marketing strategy is to capitalize on core product opportunities within these patient populations  as well as to expand product offerings 
the company has implemented a number of programs to try to improve operating margins which include staffing reductions at selected locations including the corporate office  primarily through position eliminations  reductions in workforce and attrition  certain supplier relationships have been adjusted to yield cost savings while still satisfying business requirements  and full implementation of the nurse scheduling system shine 
the company expects that the shine system will enable local management to more effectively utilize the availability of nurses in our registry and optimize the profitability of specific cases 
in addition  the company has engaged consultants and is currently in negotiations with a number of state medicaid programs to identify additional opportunities for the company s private duty nursing and ppec services which could provide the states with lower cost alternatives to existing care plans 
the company continues to pursue a managed care marketing strategy which focuses on select key markets with unfulfilled market share potential 
the company s regional managed care sales personnel work directly with branch office directors to increase local market share 
initiatives include identification of the dominant local market managed care companies and their provider networks  coordinated marketing and contracting efforts  relationship development and expansion with key referral sources  appropriate patient intakes  development of clinical outcome reporting to satisfy contractual obligations and demonstrate cost savings to the payor  and effective coordination with local market medicaid programs 
during fiscal  the company hired a new vice president for sales marketing to consolidate the company s various marketing resources and programs and focus upon the above initiatives 
source availability of clinical personnel during the weeks ending september   the company experienced an increase in case hours staffed to  from  in the rolling weeks ended june  the company continues to aggressively compete for nurses to staff hours ordered  retain nurses with select wage and benefit improvements and implement employee satisfaction initiatives 
management believes that case hours staffed is the most appropriate measurement of nursing activity 
to date  management has seen inconsistent results in a number of markets and will continue to assess and respond accordingly 
management anticipates that with the full implementation of shine  improvements in both un staffed hours and gross margin levels should occur over time  however  there can be no assurance that this will occur 
critical accounting policies net revenue due to the nature of the health care industry and the reimbursement environment in which the company operates  certain estimates are required to record net revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values 
inherent in these estimates are the risk that they will need to be revised or updated  with the changes 
table of contents recorded in subsequent periods as additional information becomes available to management 
specifically  the complexity of many third party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded 
such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application  claim denial or account review 
as of september   the company had no material claims  disputes or unsettled matters with third party payors  nor were there any material pending settlements with third party payors except as disclosed under the recent developments section above 
net revenue represents the estimated net realizable amounts from patients  third party payors and others for patient services rendered and products provided 
such net revenue is recognized as the treatment plan is administered to the patient and recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement arrangements with payors 
net revenues to be reimbursed by contracts with third party payors are recorded at an amount to be realized under these contractual arrangements 
net revenues from medicaid and medicare are generally based on reimbursement of the reasonable direct and indirect costs of providing services to program participants 
in certain situations  the services and products are recorded separately 
in other situations  the services and products are billed and reimbursed on a per diem or contract basis whereby the insurance carrier pays the company one combined amount for treatment 
because the reimbursement arrangements in these situations are based on a per diem or contract amount  the company does not maintain records that provide a breakdown between the service and product components 
the company has developed a methodology to record the estimated net revenue as a result of the inherent time lag between certain patient treatments and input of the related information into its billing and collection system 
this methodology measures relative changes in the time and overall activity level at each branch office location and aggregates these measurements to estimate the impact to consolidated net revenue 
the estimated net revenue from the inherent time lag was approximately of net revenue for fiscal years ended and  respectively 
any unforeseen volatility to either the time or activity level at specific branch offices has the potential to significantly impact the estimate 
in other select cases  patient treatments may cease for a number of reasons including re hospitalizations  changes in treatment needs  or death  and a time lag may exist before this information is reflected in the company s billing and collection system 
the company has developed a methodology which measures the historical experience over recent time periods and applies this methodology to reduce net revenues recognized in the current period 
allowance for doubtful accounts in determining the adequacy of the allowance and related provision for doubtful accounts  the company has developed a process that combines detailed analysis of historical collections and write off activity with a detailed review of existing account balances meeting certain criteria and their likelihood of being collected at the amounts recorded 
this detailed review involves both the assigned corporate reimbursement department personnel and the respective branch office location personnel assessing each patient claim that falls within prescribed age and amount criteria 
these assessments are aggregated and compared to the results of the detailed analysis of historical collections to provide additional support to management in making the estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inherent in this estimate is the risk that it will need to be revised or updated  with the changes recorded in subsequent periods  as additional information becomes available to management 
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets beginning in fiscal  the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
eliminates goodwill amortization from the consolidated statements of operations and requires an evaluation of goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  and more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
the company performs its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
for these evaluations  the company is using an implied fair value approach  which uses a discounted cash flow analysis and other valuation 
table of contents methodologies 
these evaluations use many assumptions and estimates in determining an impairment loss  including certain assumptions and estimates related to future earnings 
the company completed the impairment test and  at september   there was no resulting impairment 
subsequent impairments  if any  would be classified as operating expense 
intangible assets that meet certain criteria qualify for recording on the consolidated balance sheet and will continue to be amortized in the consolidated statements of operations 
such intangible assets will be subject to a periodic impairment test based on estimated fair value 
accrued insurance the company s insurance broker retains the services of an independent actuary to prepare an actuarial analysis of the company s development of reported and incurred but not reported claims for workers compensation and medical malpractice 
these estimates are updated as determined necessary based on recent claims history and other events 
inherent in these estimates are the risk that they will need to be revised or updated  with the changes recorded in subsequent periods  as additional information becomes available to management 
accrued workers compensation and medical malpractice losses have been discounted at 
results of operations due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which the company operates  certain estimates are required in recording net revenue 
inherent in these estimates are the risk that net revenue will have to be revised or updated  with the changes recorded in subsequent periods as additional information becomes available to management

interest income decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of lower cash balances and interest rates earned 
the company invested its excess cash balances in highly liquid investments 
for fiscal  the company recorded a net tax benefit of million primarily due to the full reversal of the previously recorded deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
management considered all available evidence  primarily focusing on scheduled reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities and projected future taxable income 
based on this analysis  management concluded it was more likely than not that all of the net deferred tax assets would be realized 
accordingly  the company reversed the remaining valuation allowance as of september  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the net tax benefit of million was allocated first to continuing operations by taking the tax effect of pretax income from continuing operations and adding the tax effect of the full reversal of the valuation allowance
