item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
factors that may affect future results matters discussed in md a and in other parts of this document include forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
this includes statements concerning management s plans and objectives relating to our operations or economic performance and related assumptions 
forward looking statements are made based on management s current expectations and beliefs concerning future events and  therefore  involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
management cautions that forward looking statements are not guarantees and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause our actual results of operations or financial condition to differ include  but are not necessarily limited  to the following factors 
general business factors o changes in the national or regional us economic conditions  including  but not limited to  recessionary trends  level of the equity markets  consumer credit availability  interest rates  inflation  consumers disposable income and spending levels  job security and unemployment  and overall consumer confidence  o continuing terrorist activities in the us  as well as the international war on terrorism  o the disruption of international  national or regional transportation systems  o changes in the amount and degree of promotional intensity exerted by current competitors and potential new competition from both retail stores and alternative methods or channels of distribution  such as e commerce  telephone shopping services and mail order  o the lack of availability or access to sources of inventory  o changes in the financial markets that would reduce or eliminate access to longer term capital or short term credit availability  o the inability to attract  retain and grow an effective management team in a dynamic environment or changes in the cost or availability of a suitable work force to manage and support our service driven operating strategies  o the imposition of new restrictions or regulations regarding the sale of products and or services we sell or changes in tax rules and regulations applicable to us  o the occurrence of severe weather events or natural disasters  which could destroy outlets or prohibit consumers from traveling to our retail locations  especially during the peak winter holiday season  radioshack specific factors o the failure to differentiate ourselves as an electronics specialty retailer in the us marketplace  o the inability to successfully execute our solutions strategy to dominate cost effective solutions to meet everyone s routine electronics needs and families distinct electronics wants  o the inability to successfully execute our strategic initiatives  including our anchor  participatory and opportunistic apos business model and emerging sales channels strategies  as well as new business arrangements which may be formed with other retailers  distributors and third party service providers  o the inability to maintain profitable contracts or execute business plans with providers of third party branded products and with service providers relating to cellular and pcs telephones and direct to home dth satellite programming  o the presence or absence of new services or products and product features in the merchandise categories we sell and unexpected changes in our actual merchandise sales mix  o the inability to collect the level of anticipated residual income  subscriber acquisition fees and rebates for products and third party services offered by us  o the inability to successfully maintain our business arrangements  including those with compaq  directv  dish network  thomson rca  sprint  and verizon wireless  o contingent lease obligations relating to our discontinued retail operations arising from a sub lessee s failure to fulfill its lease commitments  or o the inability to establish and implement our internal and external supply chain initiatives 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our conclusions 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment changes 
the use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements  but the accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical are as follows revenue recognition our revenue is derived principally from the sale of private label and third party branded products and services to consumers 
revenue is recognized  net of an estimate for customer refunds and product returns  when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain products  such as wireless phones and satellite systems  require the customer to use the services of a third party service provider 
in most cases  the third party service provider will pay us a fee or commission for obtaining a new customer  as well as a monthly recurring residual amount based upon the ongoing arrangement between the service provider and the customer 
fee or commission revenue  net of estimated service disconnects  is generally recognized at the time the customer is accepted as a subscriber of a third party service provider 
residual income is recognized as earned under the terms of each contract with the service provider  which is typically as the service provider bills its customer 
different revenues would have been recorded if we had made different assumptions or evaluations 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if actual returns  sales  fee or commission revenue adjustments exceed our estimates 
additionally  our retail operations offer repair service ie  non warranty contracts on products sold 
these contracts generally provide extended service coverage for periods ranging from to months 
we offer these contracts in all but three states on behalf of an unrelated third party obligor 
we are not considered the primary obligor on these contracts 
in these circumstances  our share of commission revenue is recognized as income at the time the contract is sold 
for the contracts offered in the three states where we are the primary obligor  revenues from the sale of these contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the contracts 
costs directly related to the sale of such contracts are deferred and charged to cost of products sold proportionately as the revenues are recognized 
a loss is recognized on extended service contracts if the sum of the expected costs of providing services pursuant to the contracts exceeds the related unearned revenue 
receivables we record receivables based on the amount of revenue recognized as described above 
our receivables are primarily comprised of amounts due from certain vendors  third party service providers  dealer franchisees and commercial customers 
the carrying amount of the receivables is continually evaluated based on the likelihood of collection 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is established for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our vendors  third party service providers and customers to make their required payments 
factors such as these parties creditworthiness  payment terms  historical results and economic conditions are considered when making these decisions 
the actual collection of receivables could be different from our recorded value 
if any of these parties creditworthiness deteriorates beyond our expectations  or if any of their actual defaults exceed our historical experience  material charges could be required to our selling  general and administrative expenses 
inventory inventory is our largest asset class 
our inventory is primarily comprised of finished goods and is recorded at the lower of cost or market using the average cost method 
we make estimates regarding the carrying value of our inventory on an item by item basis 
if the amount we expect to receive from the sale of the inventory is less than its cost  we write down the cost of the inventory to its estimated realizable value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if unexpected changes in technology affect demand for certain products  we could be exposed to losses in excess of our established reserves 
accrued expenses the amount of liability we record for claims related to self insurance  warranty and pending litigation requires us to make judgments about the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred 
we use our past history and experience  as well as other specific circumstances surrounding these claims  in evaluating the amount of liability that we should record 
actual results may be materially different from these estimates 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our various claims and revise our estimates as appropriate 
such revisions could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions  including the us  states and localities  and abroad 
we must first determine which revenues and expenses should be included in each taxing jurisdiction 
this process involves the estimation of our actual current tax exposure  together with the assessment of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences in the timing of deductions result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are recorded on our balance sheet 
if different judgments had been used  our tax liability could have been materially different 
if we prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or are required to settle matters in excess of established accruals  our effective tax rate for a particular period could be materially affected 
furthermore  if our actual results differ from estimated results or if we adjust our estimates in the future such that we would not expect to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets  we may need to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  also potentially impacting our effective tax rate 
retail outlets the table below shows our retail locations broken down between company and dealer franchise outlets

compared with net sales and operating revenues sales decreased approximately to  million in from  million in this decrease was primarily the result of a decline in sales to our dealer franchise outlets in  mainly due to the decline in dth unit sales 
in addition  we also had a decrease in comparable company store sales due primarily to the decline of dth unit sales and desktop computers  but offset by sales increases in wireless handsets and related accessories 
additionally  the number of company stores decreased slightly due to the closure of cool things blockbuster test stores in early  despite the opening of company stores  net of store closures 
we expect a sales gain for as discussed in further detail below 
retail support operations sales are generated from the outside sales of our retail support operations  consisting primarily of radioshack installation services rsis  repair centers  and domestic and overseas manufacturing 
the decrease in retail support operations sales from to primarily resulted from a million decrease in domestic manufacturing sales  due to large verizon fixture sales in  and a million decrease in rsis sales as a result of our exit from the national commercial installation business at the end of sales in the wireless communication department  which is made up of wireless handsets including related services  accessories  and wireless services such as prepaid airtime and bill payments  increased in dollars and increased to of our total retail sales in from in this sales increase was due to an increase in sales of wireless handsets and accessories which resulted from our emphasis on national carrier offerings with desirable product features and content  such as color screens  photo capability and internet access 
although we have previously experienced sales gains in this department  we realize that the overall wireless industry is experiencing a slow down in net new customer activations 
while there is no assurance that we can maintain these sales gain levels  we believe our plans  if executed successfully  will result in wireless sales increases 
sales in the wired communication department  which includes residential telephones  answering machines and other related telephony products  decreased in dollars and increased slightly as a percentage of our total retail sales to in from in increased sales of cordless telephones were more than offset by decreased sales of corded telephones 
we anticipate sales in this department will be relatively stable in sales in the radio communication department decreased in dollars and decreased slightly as a percentage of our total retail sales to in from in the decrease in this department was primarily the result of a decrease in family radio service frs and cb radio sales  scanner sales and communication accessories  partially offset by a sales increase in gps devices 
we believe that this department will experience a small sales gain in over the prior year due to the anticipated introduction of new models in the second half of the year 
sales in the home entertainment department  which consists of all home audio and video end products and accessories  including dth hardware and installation  decreased in dollars and decreased as a percentage of our total retail sales to in from in substantially all of the dollar decrease was attributable to a decrease in sales of satellite dishes and related installations 
this decrease was partially offset by increased sales of dvd players 
we expect that satellite dish sales will continue to decline in  but at a reduced rate  as compared to the prior year 
we anticipate that the other categories within the home entertainment department will have gains to offset this decline  resulting in overall flat sales in this department for sales in the computer department  which includes desktop  laptop  handheld computers and related accessories  in addition to digital cameras and home networking products  decreased slightly in dollars and increased as a percentage of our total retail sales to in from in these sales dollars were maintained primarily due to an increase in laptop computers  computer accessories and digital camera sales  offset by a decline in unit sales of desktop cpus and monitors 
we expect that sales in the computer department will increase in  driven by sales of the products discussed above  particularly digital cameras and related accessories  with this increase partially offset by a planned decrease in sales of desktop computers 
sales in the power and technical department increased in dollars and also as a percentage of our total retail sales to in from in these increases were primarily due to increased sales of general and special purpose batteries  partially offset by decreased sales of bulk and packaged wire and technical parts 
we anticipate a slight sales increase in this department in sales in the personal electronics  toys and personal audio department increased in dollars  as well as increasing as a percentage of our total retail sales to in from in  due primarily to increased sales of micro radio controlled cars and related accessories  in addition to unique giftables 
we expect that sales in this department will continue to grow in as a result of our additional name brand product offerings and our product line increases in these areas 
gross profit gross profit for was  million or of net sales and operating revenues  compared with  million or of net sales and operating revenues in gross profit decreased million or in  primarily as a result of a decrease in net sales and operating revenues 
despite this decrease in gross profit dollars  the gross profit percentage increased from to in  due primarily to an increase in the gross profit percentage in the home entertainment department and  to a lesser extent  increases in both the power and technical and computer departments gross profit percentages 
our gross profit percentage increase was partially offset by reductions in both the wireless and wired departments gross profit percentages  compounded by the increase in the wireless communication department s percent of total retail sales 
the reduction in gross profit dollars was partially offset by a decrease in the total retail sales mix for the home entertainment department  which has a lower gross profit percentage than our overall average gross profit percentage  as well as an increase in gross profit dollars for the power and technical department 
additionally  the gross profit percentage improved for our retail support operations in we anticipate that gross profit as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues will improve by the end of  when compared to  enhanced by sales mix changes towards higher margin products  such as computer accessories  batteries  toys  and personal audio and electronics  and also enhanced by improved efficiencies realized from supply chain management initiatives  particularly in vendor relations and end of life inventory management 
selling  general and administrative expense the table below summarizes the breakdown of various components of our consolidated selling  general and administrative sg a expense and its related percentage of total net sales and operating revenues 
year ended december  of of of sales sales sales in millions dollars revenues dollars revenues dollars revenues payroll and commissions rent advertising other taxes utilities and telephone insurance credit card fees california lawsuit settlement stock purchase and savings plans repairs and maintenance printing  postage and office supplies travel loss on real estate sub lease bad debt store closing costs other our sg a expense increased in dollars and increased as a percent of net sales and operating revenues to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the dollar increase for was primarily due to a million litigation charge related to the settlement of a class action lawsuit in california and a million charge to our restructuring reserve as a result of the bankruptcy of a sub lessee in a former incredible universe store site 
a million increase in our rent expense and lower overall sales in also contributed to a higher sg a expense ratio 
this was partially offset by a million charge for store closing costs from  which did not reoccur in payroll expense decreased by million to million in  but increased slightly as a percent of net sales and operating revenues to in  compared to in the decrease in dollars was due primarily to our reduction in headcount during the third quarter of rent expense increased by million to million in and increased as a percent of net sales and operating revenues to in from in these increases were due primarily to lease renewals and relocations at higher rates  as well as a slight increase in the average store size 
we expect a similar increase in rent for the same reasons described for the rent increase 
advertising expense decreased million in to million from million in  while remaining at percentage of net sales and operating revenues during both and the dollar decrease was due primarily to an increase in advertising contributions from our various vendors and third party service providers 
insurance expense increased million to million in from million in and increased as a percent of net sales and operating revenues to in  compared to in substantially all of our insurance expense relates to our self insurance programs 
we maintain reserves for self insurance liabilities related to our group medical and casualty losses  which include general and product liability and workers compensation 
in some cases  risks are insured through outside carriers for losses in excess of self insured amounts 
these reserves are adjusted to reflect estimates based on historical experience  estimated claims incurred but not reported  the impact of risk management programs and the estimated effect of external factors 
as of december   actual losses had not exceeded our expectations 
we expect insurance expense to continue to increase in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues due to the rising health care costs in the us  in addition to increases in premiums resulting from the recent terrorist activities 
in  we expect sg a expense to increase slightly in dollars  but decrease slightly as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues due to increased sales volume 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased million dollars to million and decreased as a percent of net sales and operating revenues to in from in these decreases are primarily attributable to the elimination of goodwill amortization related to amerilink corporation amerilink  as well as the sale of our corporate headquarters during the fourth quarter of we expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase slightly in  due to depreciation increases associated with store fixtures and capitalized software related to inventory management and other information systems projects 
gain on contract termination radioshack and microsoft mutually agreed during to terminate their agreement and settle the remaining commitments each had to one another 
the termination of this agreement took effect at the start of the fourth quarter of  upon satisfaction of several contractual obligations 
the net financial result was an million gain principally cash received  driven primarily by the settlement of a multi year obligation microsoft had to connect our stores with broadband capabilities 
impairment of long lived assets as a result of continued difficulties in the dth business and a refocus during the fourth quarter on our satellite installation strategy  together with a revised cash flow projection for our overall installation business  we determined that the remaining long lived assets associated with rsis were impaired 
we compared the carrying value of these long lived assets with their fair value and determined that the remaining goodwill balance of million was impaired and we  therefore  recorded an impairment charge of this amount in the accompanying consolidated statement of income 
as of december   there was no remaining goodwill balance on our balance sheet relating to rsis 
see the discussion below under the section titled compared with for further discussion of the rsis business 
loss on sale of assets there were no losses on the sale of assets in for information on prior year losses  see the discussion below under the section titled compared with employee separation and other costs there were no employee separation or other costs in for information on prior year employee separation and other costs  see the discussion below under the section titled compared with net interest expense interest expense  net of interest income  was million for versus million for interest expense decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in the average debt outstanding throughout in addition  our interest rate swap instruments also lowered overall interest expense for the year ended december   when compared to the same prior year period 
interest income decreased almost to million in from million in  due primarily to compusa s early payment of its note to us on june   which eliminated the associated interest income 
interest income  including accretion of discount as applicable  earned on the amounts outstanding during the three years ended december   and was as follows year ended december  in millions compusa note receivable other includes short term investment interest total interest income interest expense  net of interest income  is expected to be flat during  when compared to other income in the second quarter of  we received payments and recorded income of million in partial settlement of amounts owed to us under a tax sharing agreement that was the subject of an arbitration which commenced in july and was styled tandy corporation and te electronics  te vs 
o sullivan industries holdings  inc o sullivan 
the arbitration ruling requires o sullivan to comply with the tax sharing agreement that was entered into by theparties at the time of o sullivan s initial public offering 
during the second half of  we received two payments totaling million relating to quarterly payments under the tax sharing agreement with o sullivan 
future payments will vary based on the level of o sullivan s future earnings 
in the near term  we expect that the quarterly payments to us will approximate those received to date  however  these payments are dependent upon o sullivan s overall financial condition and ability to pay 
consequently  there can be no assurances that we will receive timely each payment that may be due to us under the tax sharing agreement 
provision for loss on internet related investment there were no losses on internet related investments in for information on prior year losses on internet related investments  see the discussion below under the section titled compared with provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes reflects an effective income tax rate of for and for the decrease in the effective tax rate in when compared to was the result of the impairment of rsis goodwill  which was not deductible for tax purposes and caused the increased effective tax rate in for further information  see the discussion below under the section titled compared with we anticipate that the effective tax rate for will be approximately

the home entertainment department  which consists of all home audio and video products  including dth satellites and installation services  decreased slightly in dollars and as a percentage of total retail sales to in from in this dollar decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in sales of satellite dishes  which was partially offset by increased sales of video and cable accessories 
the computer department  which includes not only computers and related accessories  but narrow and broadband connectivity  as well as home automation and networking  decreased in dollars and decreased as a percentage of total retail sales to in from in these decreases were primarily attributable to a decline in unit sales of cpus and an decrease in the average selling price of cpus from the prior year

the personal electronics  toys and personal audio department decreased in dollars  as well as decreasing as a percentage of total retail sales to in from in  due primarily to decreased sales of toys and giftables 
gross profit gross profit in was  million or of net sales and operating revenues  compared with  million or of net sales and operating revenues in gross profit for was reduced by a million charge in the fourth quarter for a write down of non strategic inventory product lines which we intend to exit 
in addition  the decline in the gross profit percentage from to was affected by a decrease in the wired communication gross margin 
this gross profit decrease was partially offset by a decrease in the total retail sales mix for the computer department  which has a lower gross margin than our overall average gross margin  as well as an increase in the computer department gross profit percentage 
increases in the gross profit percentage for the wireless communication and power and technical departments  coupled with an increase in the departments gross profit percentages  also favorably affected the overall gross profit percentage 
selling  general and administrative expense our sg a expense increased in dollars and increased as a percent of net sales and operating revenues to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  this percentage point increase in the sg a percentage in was primarily attributable to an increase in advertising expense during  without proportional sales growth 
an increase in the rent expense in also contributed to the sg a expense increase 
payroll expense decreased by million to million in and decreased as a percent of net sales and operating revenues to in  compared to in these decreases were due primarily to a reduction in our labor force during and reduced incentive pay resulting from a decrease in operating income 
advertising expense increased million to million and increased to as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in  compared to million and of sales in both the dollar and percentage point increases were due primarily to a decrease in advertising contributions from our various vendors and third party service providers and  to a lesser extent  an increase in tv commercials 
rent expense increased by million to million in and increased as a percent of net sales and operating revenues to in from in the rent increase was partially due to new company store openings throughout the year  as well as the addition of the cool things blockbuster test stores 
the relocation of existing stores to larger locations  as well as a renewal of store leases at higher rates  also contributed to the rent expense increase 
bad debt expense increased by million to million in and increased as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues to in from in the bad debt increase was primarily related to both bankruptcies and uncollected accounts receivable  as well as the write off of a note receivable from digital convergence corporation dc 
store closing costs of million in relate to the closure of underperforming stores prior to the expiration of their leases 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased million dollars to million and increased as a percent of net sales and operating revenues to in from in impairment of long lived assets amerilink  also known as rsis  was acquired in to provide us with residential installation capabilities for the technologies and services offered in our retail stores 
since its acquisition  rsis has incurred operating losses and negative cash flows 
in and in  we attempted to restructure and reorganize rsis  but due to the overall slowdown in the economy and the market decline for professionally installed home internet connectivity services  rsis continued to report losses 
during the fourth quarter of  we prepared a revised analysis of estimated future cash flows for rsis  which indicated that its long lived assets were impaired 
the carrying value of rsis s long lived assets principally goodwill and fixed assets exceeded the discounted present value of the estimated future cash flows by approximately million 
an impairment of goodwill for that amount was recorded and included in the accompanying consolidated statement of income 
our test concept with blockbuster to introduce a radioshack store within a store at blockbuster locations did not provide sufficient cash flows to recover our investment in fixtures and other fixed assets 
an impairment loss of million was recorded for those assets in and is included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
loss on sale of assets in the fourth quarter of  we sold and leased back most of our corporate headquarters at a loss of million 
on june   we received million for the settlement of the purchase price and settlement of the million note which was received in connection with the sale of computer city  inc in thus  we incurred an additional loss from the sale of computer city  inc of million 
employee separation and other costs during the third quarter of  as part of our effort to control operating costs  we incurred approximately million in charges related to a reduction of our labor force  primarily for early retirements and involuntary and voluntary employee severance 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  million in charges were incurred relating to the closure of rsis s national commercial installation business 
these costs were primarily comprised of severance costs  write offs of certain fixed assets and future lease commitments 
net interest expense interest expense  net of interest income  was million for versus million for interest expense decreased to million in  from million in this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in the average debt outstanding throughout interest income decreased almost to million in from million in  due primarily to repayment of various notes receivable associated with our exit of other retail formats in previous years 
provision for loss on internet related investment during the second quarter of  we made a million investment in dc  a privately held internet technology company 
in the first quarter of  we concluded that our investment had experienced a decline in value that  in our opinion  was other than temporary 
this conclusion was based on dc s inability to secure sufficient additional funding or to complete an initial public offering 
as such  we recorded a loss provision equal to our initial investment 
dc subsequently filed for bankruptcy on march  provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of for and for the increase in the effective tax rate in was the result of the impairment of rsis goodwill discussed above  which was not deductible for tax purposes

we used million  million and million for the repurchase of our common and preferred stock in  and  respectively 
repurchases of common stock were made under our share repurchase and employee stock plans 
see further discussion of our stock repurchase programs below in the section titled capital structure and financial condition 
the  and stock repurchases were partially funded by million  million and million  respectively  received from the sale of treasury stock to employee stock plans and to a lesser extent from stock option exercises 
the balance of capital to repurchase shares was obtained from cash generated from operations 
we purchased all of microsoft s preferred units in radioshack 
com llc for million during the third quarter of we also received million from the sale and lease back of our corporate technology center building during the second quarter of this transaction was recorded as a financing obligation due to responsibilities which we retain during the lease period 
dividends paid  net of tax  in  and amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
the long term notes we issued in provided approximately million in cash  the majority of which was used to repay short term debt 
in  the increase in short term debt was used primarily to fund increases in accounts receivable  stock repurchases and additional inventory 
our free cash flow  defined as cash flow from operating activities less dividends paid and additions to property  plant and equipment  was million in  compared to million in we believe free cash flow is an appropriate indication of the corporation s ability to fund share repurchases  repay maturing debt  change dividend payments or fund other uses of capital that management believes will enhance shareholder value 
the decrease in free cash flow  compared to  was due primarily to an increase in the working capital components  principally inventory  as described above 
we expect free cash flow to be approximately to million in the anticipated decrease in free cash flow from to is primarily related to the increase in capital expenditures noted above 
the comparable financial measure to free cash flow under gaap is cash flow from operating activities  which was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the following table is a reconciliation of cash provided from operating activities to free cash flow 
year ended december  in millions net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property  plant and equipment dividends paid free negative free cash flow capital structure and financial condition management considers our financial structure and condition solid 
at december   total capitalization was  million  consisting of million of debt and million of equity and resulting in a debt to total capitalization ratio of  which was equal to the prior year debt to total capitalization ratio 
the ratio remained the same as the prior year due to proportional decreases in debt of million and equity of million from long term debt as a percentage of total capitalization was at december   compared to at december   and at december  this increase in was due to the financing obligation resulting from the sale and lease back of our corporate technology center building and the reduction of equity 
our debt is considered investment grade by the rating agencies 
there were no changes to our debt ratings during the year 
below are their latest ratings by category 
standard category moody s and poor s fitch medium term notes baa a a esop senior notes baa a a commercial paper p a f our debt primarily consists of medium term notes and two issuances of year long term notes 
we have a million debt shelf registration statement shelf registration which became effective in august in august  we issued million of year unsecured long term notes under the shelf registration 
the interest rate on the notes is per annum with interest payable on september and march of each year  commencing march  these notes are due september  we also issued  in various amounts and on various dates from december through september  medium term notes totaling million under the shelf registration 
at december   million of these notes remained outstanding 
the interest rates at december   for the outstanding million medium term notes ranged from to and had a weighted average coupon rate of 
these notes have maturities ranging from to as of december   there was no availability under this shelf registration 
on may   we issued million of year notes in a private offering to initial purchasers who offered the notes to qualified institutional buyers under sec rule a 
the annual interest rate on the notes is per annum with interest payable on november and may of each year 
payment of interest on the notes commenced on november   and the notes mature on may  in august  under the terms of an exchange offering filed with the sec  we exchanged substantially all of these notes for a similar amount of publicly registered notes 
because no additional debt was issued in the exchange offering  the net effect of this exchange was that no additional debt was issued on august   and substantially all of the notes are now registered with the sec 
during the third quarter of  we entered into several interest rate swap agreements  with maturities ranging from to  to manage our exposure to interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our long term fixed rate debt to variable rates 
we entered into these agreements to balance our debt portfolio by changing from all fixed interest rates to a mixture of fixed and floating interest rates  thereby taking advantage of lower short term rates 
the notional amount of the interest rate swaps subject to variable rates is million 
under these agreements  we have contracted to pay a variable rate based upon libor and to receive fixed rate payments ranging from to 
we have designated the agreements as fair value hedging instruments 
at december   we recorded an asset in other assets  net  of million its fair value for the swap agreements and adjusted the fair value of the related debt by the same amount 
the effect of these agreements was a reduction in our interest expense of million during  when compared to the fixed rates 
at current interest rates  we expect this favorable condition to reoccur in from time to time  we utilize short term debt such as commercial paper issuances and uncommitted bank loans to supplement our short term financing needs 
the commercial paper and the short term seasonal bank debt have a typical maturity of days or less 
the amount of commercial paper that can be outstanding is limited to a maximum of the unused portion of our million bank syndicated revolving credit facility described in more detail below 
in the second quarter of  we replaced our existing million bank syndicated credit facilities with new bank syndicated credit facilities  also totaling million 
these facilities are comprised of a million day revolving credit facility maturing in june and a million five year revolving credit facility maturing in june the terms of these revolving credit facilities are substantially similar to the previous facilities 
the new revolving credit facilities will support any future commercial paper borrowings and are otherwise available for our general corporate purposes 
we anticipate replacing our day revolving credit facility which matures in june with a new day credit facility with similar terms 
as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities 
we use operating leases  primarily for our retail locations  distribution centers and corporate headquarters  to lower our capital requirements 
other than these operating leases  we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or transactions  arrangements or relationships with special purpose entities 
our outstanding debt and bank syndicated credit facilities have customary financial covenants 
management believes that our present ability to borrow is greater than our established credit lines and long term debt in place 
however  if market conditions changed and sales were to be dramatically reduced or operating costs could not be controlled  our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced 
additionally  if a scenario as described above occurred  it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit ratings  thereby increasing our borrowing costs  or even causing a reduction in or elimination of our access to debt and or equity markets 
we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million for the year ended december   under our existing million share repurchase program 
in connection with our share repurchase program  our board of directors authorized us to enter into both equity forwards and put options  with expiration dates no later than december   covering up to million shares of our common stock  consequently  there were no outstanding equity forward instruments or put options at december  we may continue to execute share repurchases from time to time in order to take advantage of attractive share price levels  as determined by management 
the timing and terms of the transactions depend on market conditions  our liquidity and other considerations 
on february   our board of directors authorized a new repurchase program for million shares  which is in addition to our existing million share repurchase program 
at february   there were million shares available to be repurchased under the two repurchase programs 
we anticipate that we will repurchase  under our authorized repurchase programs  between million and million of our common stock during this new program has no expiration date and allows shares to be repurchased in the open market 
the funding required for these share repurchase programs will come from cash generated from net sales and operating revenues and cash and cash equivalents 
under our programs described above  we will also repurchase shares in the open market to offset the sales of shares to our employee stock plans 
on october   our board of directors approved the conversion of our radioshack series b convertible preferred stock  held by the radioshack k plan  to radioshack common stock effective december  on december   million shares of this preferred stock  representing all the outstanding series b convertible preferred stock were converted to million shares of our common stock 
the preferred stock was held by the radioshack k plan to fund radioshack contributions to plan participants 
in the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of  we sold our corporate headquarters buildings and we are now constructing a new headquarters in fort worth  texas 
we entered into sale leaseback agreements in which our existing corporate headquarters land and buildings were sold and leased back to us 
these arrangements should provide us with the necessary time to construct our new headquarters  which we expect to be completed by the end of or early currently  we plan to finance our new corporate headquarters  with construction costs estimated to total million during and  with cash from operations and  if needed  existing cash and cash equivalents 
the following tables  as well as the information contained in note indebtedness and borrowing facilities to our notes to consolidated financial statements  provide a summary of our various contractual commitments  debt and interest repayment requirements  and available credit lines 
the table below contains the contractual commitments associated with our financing obligations  lease obligations  and marketing agreements 
in millions december  thereafter total debt principal debt interest financing obligation operating leases marketing agreements the table below contains our credit commitments from various financial institutions 
in millions commitment expiration per period total amounts less than credit commitments committed year years years over years lines of credit stand by letters of credit total commercial commitments we have contingent liabilities related to retail leases of locations which were assigned to other businesses 
the majority of these contingent liabilities relate to various lease obligations arising from leases that were assigned to compusa  inc as part of the sales of our computer city  inc 
subsidiary to compusa  inc in august in the event compusa or the other assignees  as applicable  are unable to fulfill their obligations  we would be responsible for rent due under the leases 
our rent exposure from the remaining undiscounted lease commitments with no projected sublease income is approximately million 
moreover  we have no reason to believe that compusa or the other assignees will not fulfill their obligations under these leases  consequently  we do not believe there will be a material impact on our financial statements 
inflation inflation has not significantly impacted us over the past three years 
we do not expect inflation to have a significant impact on our operations in the foreseeable future  unless world events substantially affect the global economy 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
at december   we did not have any derivative instruments that materially increased our exposure to market risks for interest rates  foreign currency rates  commodity prices or other market price risks  other than the interest rate swaps noted in md a 
we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes 
our exposure to interest rate risk results from changes in short term interest rates 
interest rate risk exists with respect to our net investment of million  comprised of fluctuating short term investments of million and offset by million of indebtedness which  because of the interest rate swaps discussed in md a  effectively bears interest at short term floating rates 
in the future  an unfavorable change of basis points in the interest rate applicable to this floating rate net exposure could result in an increase in annual net interest expense of million 
this assumption assumes no change in the net principal balance 
we also manage our portfolio of fixed rate debt to reduce our exposure to interest rate changes 
the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt is sensitive to interest rate changes 
interest rate changes would result in increases or decreases in the fair value of our debt due to differences between market interest rates and rates at the inception of the debt obligation 
based on a hypothetical immediate basis point increase in interest rates at december  and  the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt would decrease for both years by million  respectively 
based on a hypothetical immediate basis point decrease in interest rates at december  and  the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt would increase by million and million  respectively 
regarding the fair value of our fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates have no impact on our consolidated financial statements
