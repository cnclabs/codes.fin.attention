these businesses were sold during and are reported as discontinued operations 
the company s customers include original equipment manufacturers and end users in a variety of industries  such as transportation  power generation  chemicals  metals  home electronics  office equipment and consumer goods 
the company s business units are organized into two major product categories metals manufactures and markets fabricated and machined industrial metal parts and products including large diameter seamless pressure vessels  hydraulic and pneumatic cylinders and leaf springs 
plastics manufactures precision molded plastic parts and provides engineered plastics services 
metals includes two reportable segments pressure vessels and springs  cylinders 
plastics is a single segment 
recent events in the fourth quarter of  we developed and adopted a restructure plan for our continuing businesses and certain other businesses were identified for disposal 
elements of the plan included consolidation of our pressure vessel operations into one facility  consolidation of our cylinder operations into one facility  eliminate plastics corporate headquarters and address certain asset impairments 
we also planned to sell our bridges and cranes and material handling systems operations  which we then accounted for as discontinued operations 
the plan was approved by the company s board of directors in december the company recorded a fourth quarter charge for restructuring costs  including facility shut down costs  lease termination costs and asset writedowns  including impaired goodwill related to plastics  and a charge for estimated loss on disposal of discontinued operations related solely to alliance machine including phase out period operating losses  lease termination costs and asset writedowns 
the charges are identified below discontinued restructuring operations asset impairments   goodwill impairment plastics  lease termination costs  reserve for operating losses during phase out  employee separations total charges   during  the company has made significant progress towards completion of the plan 
on september   we sold kingway  our discontinued materials handling systems operations  for cash proceeds of million and a million note receivable 
future proceeds from the note receivable are contingent upon the operating results of the combined operations of the buyer s material handling businesses 
the net cash proceeds of million after transaction related expenses were used to reduce borrowings under our boa revolving credit facility of million  term loan a facility of million and pay overadvance fees of million 
we realized a net gain of million  classified within discontinued operations  on this transaction 
finalization of this sale is subject to a post closing working capital adjustment 
this amount is in dispute between the company and the buyer 
the buyer alleges it is owed approximately  based on its calculation of working capital on the closing date 
although we have accrued an approximate mid point estimate of  related to this post closing adjustment  based on our review of their calculation we have determined that we are owed an additional  pursuant to the asset purchase agreement  both parties have agreed to submit this dispute to a mutually agreed upon independent accounting firm for resolution in arbitration 
on june   we sold the inventory and substantially all of the property  plant and equipment of alliance  our discontinued bridges and cranes operations  for cash proceeds of million and the assumption by the buyer of  of accrued liabilities 
we retained all receivables  trade payables and certain other liabilities of this discontinued operation 
the net cash proceeds of million were used to reduce borrowings under our boa revolving credit facility  term loan a facility million and capital expenditure facility 
we realized a loss of million  classified within discontinued operations  on this transaction 
during the first quarter of  npsac  the company s former pressure vessel operations in clearfield  utah  was relocated to and combined with the pressure vessel operations in mckeesport  pa 
the cylinder operations in milwaukee  wi have been relocated to our leased facility in libertyville  il 
the land and building in milwaukee  wi is being prepared for sale 
we have been preparing to move the cylinder operations in chicago  il to the libertyville facility 
we closed the plastics corporate headquarters in charlotte  nc and all administrative and managerial positions were eliminated 
plastics corporate responsibilities have been returned to our manufacturing and administrative operations in oneida  ny 
we reevaluated the shut down of our plastics operation in siler city  nc and have determined to maintain our presence in the southern us and service the customers of the siler city  nc location 
the cash components of the charge were comprised of reserves for lease termination costs and employee separations 
we did not accrue for any additional employee separations related to the restructuring  although such separations totaled approximately employees as of december  the termination costs were recorded upon notification to the employees  which occurred in the same period as the terminations 
the following represents a summary of cash activity of our restructuring charge in thousands at at description activity lease termination costs  employee separations reserve for restructuring  of the remaining lease termination costs  relates to idle manufacturing facilities in milwaukee  wisconsin and clearfield  utah 
the remainder relates to lease commitments under idle machinery in the plastics group 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  continuing operations net sales  gross margins and ebitda percentages for and are as follows 
net sales gross margin ebitda pressure vessels and springs   cylinders   plastics   totals   pressure vessels and springs sales were down significantly in compared to this decrease is due primarily to management s decision to shut down our pressure vessels facility during the first quarter of and also in july we made these decisions to reduce spending due to our liquidity problems and to lessen the strain on this segment s raw material vendors 
the decrease was also caused by the fact that the first quarter of included the recognition of million of revenues on a large nasa contract manufactured in but shipped in the first quarter of we have made significant progress in correcting vendor related issues with cash proceeds from asset sales resulting in greater raw material availability 
although not a certainty  
this segment s sales should recover to near normal operating levels in 
sales of cylinders in was affected by the temporary manufacturing disruption caused by the relocation of our former milwaukee  wi cylinder operations to libertyville  il and continues to be affected by a softness in this market 
although not a certainty  
management believes this trend will bottom out and reverse during 
the decrease in plastics revenues is the continuation of a downward trend which began in and resulted from several factors  including certain customers relocating manufacturing operations to mexico and asia  reduced customer orders for continuing programs  end of product cycles and delays in new program starts  which affected all plastics facilities 
plastics also lost a top ten customer in the second half of to competitive bidding on the internet 

management is seeking to expand plastics product offerings in the business machines  consumer products and medical products industries to mitigate this trend 
although not a certainty  
management believes this trend will bottom out and reverse during 
gross margins in were negatively affected by inventory charges of million at pressure vessels and springs  million at cylinders and  at plastics 
excluding these charges  the decreases in gross margins across all segments is related to volume declines resulting in a decrease in production activity and our inability to absorb costs 
we have responded to these conditions by completing our plan to restructure  including disposing of assets  combining certain operations and eliminating various administrative and management positions 

the benefits of these actions have only been partially realized to date 
management evaluates the company s segments based on ebitda  a measure of cash generation  which is presented  not as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  but because it is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service debt and due to the close relationship it bears to reunion s financial covenants in its borrowing agreements 
ebitda and ebitda as a percentage of sales in were negatively affected by charges totaling million at pressure vessels and springs  million at cylinders and million at plastics 
excluding these charges  ebitda and ebitda as a percentage of sales decreased during compared to primarily due to the same factors affecting gross profit margin discussed above 
total ebitda as a percentage of sales in and exclude corporate and other ebitda of negative million and million  respectively 
a reconciliation of ebitda to operating losses in and by segment and corporate and other is as follows s operating deprec amortiz loss iation ation ebitda pressure vessels and springs  cylinders plastics   corporate and other   totals   pressure vessels and springs   cylinders   plastics    corporate and other    goodwill impairment   totals    selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sga expenses for were million  compared to million for this decrease in sga is directly related to the decreasing trend in sales  resulting in lower commissions expense  cost cutting measures taken during june and progress made on the restructuring  both of which included personnel reductions in sales and administration 

management estimates the savings from these reductions to be approximately million annually 
however  the benefits of these cost cutting measures are being more than offset by the continuation of the negative trend in sales and the resulting effect on the company s ability to absorb costs 
sga expenses as a percentage of sales increased to for compared to in although sga as a percentage of sales was higher in compared to  which was due to the faster rate at which volume decreased compared to decreases in relatively fixed administrative costs  sga as a percentage of sales should decrease in with 
the volume increases anticipated by management 
other income expense other income for was million  compared to other expense of million for the components are as follows change amortization of goodwill and other intangibles   gain on sale of equipment with zero book value other income expense  net total other income expense  net   we stopped amortizing goodwill effective january  in both december and january  we sold two items of equipment at  neither of which had book value 
the increase in the remaining other income is primarily due to higher levels of sales of scrap and miscellaneous parts due to cleaning out idled facilities 
there were no significant offsetting items netted into other income expense  net  in either period 
interest expense interest expense  net  for was almost million compared to million for for and  a total of million and million  respectively  of interest expense has been allocated to or actually incurred in discontinued operations 
on a combined basis  interest expense was million in compared to million in although our debt has decreased by million using cash from asset sales  and prime lending rates have decreased from the end of levels to the end of levels  the effect on interest expense resulting from these decreases was more than offset by the increased default rate being paid on the boa revolving credit and term loan facilities and million in overadvance fees paid in income taxes there was no tax provision from continuing operations in compared to a tax provision of million for the company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal tax return reporting purposes totaling million at december   million of which expire by in and and continuing until and if the company returns to profitability and it is more likely than not that the company will realize some benefit from its loss carryforwards  management has determined to fully reserve for the total amount of net deferred tax assets as of december  and discontinued operations there was a loss from discontinued operations for of million compared to a loss from discontinued operations of million in the loss from discontinued operations in relates to a million gain on disposal of the discontinued materials handling systems operations in september partially offset by a loss from its discontinued operations of million  which includes allocated interest expense of million  and a loss on disposal of the discontinued bridges and cranes operations of million  which includes allocated interest expense of million 
the loss on disposal of the discontinued bridges and cranes operations differed from the due to adjustments of the carrying values to net realizable value  primarily machinery and equipment and receivables  of assets retained from the sale of the discontinued bridges and cranes operations 
there was a loss from discontinued operations for of million 
the company recorded a fourth quarter charge for estimated loss on disposal of discontinued operations million related to estimated phase out period operating losses  lease termination costs and asset writedowns of the discontinued bridges and cranes business 
as management expects that the materials handling systems business will be sold at a price exceeding its carrying value 
there was a loss from discontinued bridges and cranes operations during million and income from discontinued materials handling systems operations million 
management adjusted the reserve for estimated expenses related to chatwins group s former grating business million due to an increase in estimated future operating lease commitments 
there was a loss from discontinued agricultural operations  during for  discontinued operations includes a total of million of interest expense 
interest expense is allocated to discontinued operations on the basis of the percentage of total average assets of discontinued operations to gross total assets for the period presented 
other comprehensive loss there was an other comprehensive loss in of million compared to million in both other comprehensive losses relate to additional minimum pension liabilities recorded as the result of the decline in the fair market value of the assets of the company s two defined benefit pension plans 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  continuing operations metals metals net sales  gross margins and ebitda percentages for and are as follows 
pressure vessels and spring sales and margins for are pro forma as though the acquisition of npsac occurred at the beginning of cylinders ebitda percentage for excludes a million gain on sale of its chicago  il property 
net sales gross margin ebitda pressure vessels and springs   cylinders   metals totals   the increase in pressure vessel sales in compared to was due to a strong order levels in that product line towards the end of  the backlog for which at the end of was million higher than at the end of  and the recognition of million of revenues on a large nasa contract shipped in the first quarter of gross margin has been affected by a change in product mix towards lower margin domestic products  an increase in unfavorable variances in the fourth quarter of due to decrease in production activity as the result of lower order levels towards the end of and provisions for obsolete and slow moving inventories of million in the fourth quarter of also  sales of leaf springs in continued to be impacted by the economic downturn as consumers decreased spending on recreational items  particularly in the marine market 

management anticipates that these trends will continue into 
sales of cylinders continues to be affected by a downturn in this market  
a trend which the company believes will continue into 
gross margin has been affected accordingly as the decreased volume has significantly impact this segment s ability to absorb costs 
gross margin has also been impacted by provisions for obsolete and slow moving inventories of million in the fourth quarter of plastics plastics sales for totaled million  compared to million in year to date plastics sales included million from its former irish plastics subsidiary which the company sold in the third quarter but excluded million of sales from the pre march  merger period 
on a proforma basis assuming these events occurred at the beginning of  plastics sales would have been million  indicating a million decrease year to year 
this decrease in revenues is the continuation during of a downward trend which began in and resulted from several factors  including certain customers relocating manufacturing operations to mexico and asia  reduced customer orders for continuing programs  end of product cycles and delays in new program starts  which affected all plastics facilities 

management is seeking to expand plastics product offerings in the business machines  consumer products and medical products industries to mitigate this trend 
however  if not successful  this trend in plastics revenue could continue into 
plastics gross profit for was million  or  compared to million  or  for on a proforma basis for the events described above plastics gross profit and margin would be million  or 
the decrease in gross profit and margin is directly related to the decreasing trend in sales  resulting in inefficiencies and the inability to absorb fixed overheads 

depending on future sales volumes  the declining trend in gross margin could continue 
plastics ebitda for was a negative million  or negative  compared to million  or  for on a proforma basis for the events described above  plastics ebitda and percentage would be million  or 
ebitda was impacted by the same factors as gross profit and margin 
management evaluates the company s segments based on ebitda  a measure of cash generation  and is presented  not as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  but because it is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service debt and due to the close relationship it bears to reunion s financial covenants in its borrowing agreements

this decrease in sga is directly related to the decreasing trend in sales  resulting in lower commissions expense  and cost cutting measures taken during june  which included personnel reductions in sales and administration 
the cost of these reductions was inconsequential as the company paid no severance packages and retained no post severance obligations related to these reductions 

management estimates the savings from these reductions to be approximately million annually 
however  the benefits of these cost cutting measures are being offset by the continuation of the negative trend in sales and the resulting effect on the company s ability to absorb costs 
sga expenses as a percentage of sales increased to for compared to on a proforma basis in sga as a percentage of sales was higher in compared to due to the faster rate at which volume has decreased compared to decreases in relatively fixed administrative costs 
provision for restructuring the company recorded a fourth quarter charge for restructuring costs  including facility shut down costs  lease termination costs and asset writedowns  including impaired goodwill related to plastics

except for goodwill amortization and the gains as described above  there were no individually significant or offsetting items in either or interest expense interest expense  net  for and was million 
although level from year to year  interest expense decreased due to the lower level of debt of the company as the result of a decrease in overadvance fees in compared to overadvance fees paid in the first half of before the company significantly reduced debt levels in the second half of through asset sales  the million of cash proceeds generated through asset sales and used to reduce debt during the second half of and the lower interest rates on the company s bank of america facilities due to the many rate reductions by the federal reserve after june the decreases were offset by an increase due to the debt assumed in the npsac acquisition  an increase in amortization of deferred financing fees and an increase in interest rates in november on the company s bank of america facilities to a default rate as specified in the boa financing and security agreement

the company may be able to utilize its loss carryforwards against possible increased profitability as the result of the company s corporate wide restructuring plan 
however  until the amount of proceeds from and timing of asset dispositions as part of such plan are known  management has determined to fully reserve for the total amount of net deferred tax assets as of december  the tax benefit from continuing operations in was the result of a decrease in the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets related to the company s net operating loss carryforwards established at the merger date due a change in the then current estimates of future taxable income

the facilities require reunion to comply with financial covenants  including fixed charge coverage and leverage tests  and other covenants 
the fixed charge coverage covenant requires the company to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio to be tested as of the last day of each fiscal quarter 
the components of the calculation are on a rolling twelve month basis 
the ratio is defined as ebitda adjusted to exclude non financed capital expenditures and income taxes paid divided by fixed charges defined as scheduled or required principal and interest payments on debt 
the leverage test is defined as the ratio of funded debt to ebitda 
funded debt is defined as all secured and unsecured long term debt  including current maturities 
see covenant compliance below 
in addition  the facilities contain various affirmative and negative covenants  including limitations on stockholder and related party distributions 
the company was in compliance with all such non financial covenants 
the facilities require reunion to pay the reasonable expenses incurred by the lenders in connection with the facilities 
available borrowings under the bank of america revolving credit facility are based upon a percentage of eligible receivables and inventories

when this evaluation indicates such inventories exist  the reserve is increased by a charge to operations or such inventories are written off 
goodwill and impairment the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses is considered to be goodwill and  until december   was being amortized over years using the straight line method 
the company reviews goodwill when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
we also review goodwill as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill be tested annually using a two step process 
the first is to identify any potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of reporting units to their fair value 
if a potential impairment is identified  the second step is to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the impairment loss 
reporting unit fair value is estimated using the income approach  which assumes that the value of a reporting unit can be computed as the present value of the assumed future returns of an enterprise discounted at a rate of return that reflects the riskiness of an investment 
a significant increase in the rate at which the assumed future returns are discounted could result in an unexpected impairment charge to goodwill  which could have a negative impact on our operating results 
at december   the company had million of goodwill on its consolidated balance sheet 
of the million of goodwill  million relates to the pressure vessels and springs segment and million relates to the cylinders segment 
we have completed all transitional and annual impairment tests necessary to date and concluded that our goodwill is not impaired 
pensions the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions which requires that amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
the company makes contributions to the defined benefit plans based on the minimum funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act of the company uses the fair value of plan assets to determine the expected and actual returns on plan assets 
the difference between the expected return and actual return is deferred 
during the second half of and the year  the fair value of assets in both of the company s defined benefit pension plans decreased for various reasons  including a downturn in the overall economy and unusual world events 
this decrease in asset values resulted in the company recording additional minimum pension liabilities in excess of amounts previously accrued totalling million  which is classified as accumulated comprehensive loss within stockholders deficit at december  although management believes the long term rates of return used to calculate the expected returns on plan assets are reasonable  a trend of actual returns being less than expected returns has developed such that future pension costs will likely increase 
in determining the discount rates to be used at the end of each year to determine plan liabilities  the company looks at rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
changes in discount rates over the last three years have not materially affected pension costs and the net effect of changes in the discount rate  as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience  have been deferred as allowed by sfas 
the company currently expects consolidated pension costs for to increase from 
other postretirement benefits the company provides health benefits for certain retired employees at the company s pressure vessel operations and plastics and of its corporate executive payroll 
these plans are not funded 
other postretirement benefit costs and the benefit obligation are actuarially determined based on discount rates and expected trends in healthcare costs 
recent experience has been less favorable during than the actuarial assumptions resulting in a deferral of costs 
as a result  
the company currently expects consolidated other postretirement benefit costs for to increase from 
stock based compensation the company has elected to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations in accounting for stock options and awards 
accordingly  no compensation costs for stock options is included in operating results since all awards were made at exercise prices at or above their fair value on the dates of grants 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  amending fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement amends sfas no 
to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosure about the effects on operating results of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also amend apb  interim financial reporting to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information 
we adopted the disclosure provisions for the year ended december the following table illustrates the effect on results of operations if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
year ended december  net loss income as reported    add stock based employee compensation expense included in reported results deduct total stock based employee compensation determined under fair value method for stock options  net of tax deduct preferred dividend accretions pro forma income loss applicable to common stockholders    basic loss earnings per share  as reported basic loss earnings per share  pro forma diluted loss earnings per share  as reported diluted loss earnings per share  pro forma environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired  a loss is recognized assuming the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
except as described in the following paragraphs  the company believes it is currently in material compliance with existing environmental protection laws and regulations and is not involved in any significant remediation activities or administrative or judicial proceedings arising under federal  state or local environmental protection laws and regulations 
in addition to management personnel who are responsible for monitoring environmental compliance and arranging for remedial actions that may be required  the company has also employed outside consultants from time to time to advise and assist the company s environmental compliance efforts 
except as described in the following paragraphs  the company has not recorded any accruals for environmental costs 
in february  reunion was informed by a contracted environmental services consulting firm that soil and ground water contamination exists at its lafayette  indiana site 
since then  the company has expended  of remediation costs 
the company estimates completion of this remediation effort to be  in connection with the sale of its former oil and gas operations  pre merger reunion retained certain oil and gas properties in louisiana because of litigation concerning environmental matters 
the company is in the process of environmental remediation under a plan approved by the louisiana department of natural resources office of conservation ldnroc 
the company has recorded an accrual for its proportionate share of the remaining estimated costs to remediate the site based on plans and estimates developed by the environmental consultants hired by the company 
during  the company conducted remediation work on the property 
the company paid  of the total cost of  regulatory hearings were held in january and to consider the adequacy of the remediation conducted to date 
in august  ldnroc issued its order for the company to complete the soil remediation under the plan approved in and to perform additional testing to determine to what extent groundwater contamination might exist 
no remediation was performed in  or pending the decision 
however  the company has paid  for its share of consulting services in connection with the hearings 
most recently  the company s environmental consultants filed with the ldnroc updated amendments to the prior approved plan for sampling and remediation 
if approved  the plan will be implemented 
at december   after accruing an additional  in december  the balance accrued for these remediation costs is approximately  the company believes that future remediation costs will not exceed the amount accrued 
litigation on this matter had been stayed pending the determination by the ldnroc as to the extent of remediation that would be required 
most recently  such stay was lifted and the district court has established a jury trial for september  to determine the necessity for any further remediation and the extent of damages  if any  suffered by the plaintiff owners of the property 
the company is contesting this litigation and believes its proposed methodology is well within accepted industry practice for remediation efforts of a similar nature 
no accrual has been made for costs of any potential alternative clean up methodology that might be imposed as a result of the outcome of the litigation 
on march   the company received a request for information from the united states environmental protection agency usepa regarding the gambonini mine site outside petaluma  marin county  california 
the company gathered and forwarded to the usepa the information it requested 
on may   the company  as the successor to buttes gas oil company bgo  received from the usepa a notice of potential liability and demand for payment of  for reimbursement of costs related to its removal and disposal efforts initiated in pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla 
bgo  predecessor by merger to the company  leased the site for mining purposes and operated a mercury mine on this site from to bgo s mining operations were terminated in subsequently  under the supervision of the environmental and planning representatives of marin county  bgo completed closure and environmental restoration activities at the site  including stabilization and re vegetation of the site 
bgo then quitclaimed the mining lease back to the gambonini s in because of apparent overgrazing at the site subsequent to bgo s restoration efforts  a storm in caused severe flooding resulting in the failure of the dam built to retain mining materials 
runoff from the flood released mining materials into the creek below and  ultimately  into the tomales bay  a local recreation and fishing area 
in  bgo  headquartered in houston  texas  filed chapter proceedings in bankruptcy court in the southern district of texas in houston 
in december  bgo confirmed its plan of reorganization which provided for  among other things  a discharge of all claims that arose prior to the date of confirmation of the plan 
the reorganization plan became effective in february in response to the usepa s demand  the company filed an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court in the southern district of texas in houston seeking an order to enjoin the efforts of the usepa to pursue collection of any claims related to the site 
the usepa responded by filing a motion to dismiss based on several jurisdictional and substantive grounds 
a status conference was held on august   at which time the judge for the bankruptcy court in the southern district of texas in houston ruled that the court did not have jurisdiction and  at that time  the company and the usepa entered into a standstill agreement through december  which has been extended through may  in march  the company and the usepa reached an agreement in principle to settle the usepa s demand for payment for  payable in three installments over a two year period 
this amount has been accrued as of december  this settlement agreement will resolve the usepa s claims for reimbursement of environmental response costs  but does not resolve all possible claims the united states may have with respect to the gambonini mine site which could include  but not be limited to  claims for natural resource damage 
the united states has given no indication as to whether or not it will pursue such claims 
however  the company has agreed in principle to extend the statute of limitations with respect to any such claims for a period of five years from the date of the execution of the above discussed settlement agreement 
factors that could affect future results reunion is a going concern the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
the negative working capital position of  the defaults of the boa financing and security agreement and the senior notes  and the lack of borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility indicate that 
the company may not be able to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
reunion s vendors may restrict credit terms we have corrected many vendor related problems with liquidity generated from asset sales 
however  another period of tight liquidity could result in key vendors restricting or eliminating the extension of credit terms to us 
if this would happen  our ability to obtain raw materials would be strained significantly and our ability to manufacture products would be reduced 
reunion may not be able to consummate a planned refinancing we have made significant progress recently on a planned refinancing of our boa term and revolving credit obligations 
however  it is not a certainty that this planned refinancing will happen 
if we are unable to refinance our boa credit facilities  they may move to take advantage of all remedies available to them including  but not limited to  acceleration of all amount currently due and a liquidation of their collateral 
reunion s senior noteholders may accelerate although our senior note obligations are in default  the senior noteholders have stood still as we continue to work through the refinancing of our boa credit facilities 
however  it is not a certainty that they will continue to stand still and they may move to take advantage of all remedies available to them including  but not limited to  acceleration of all amount currently due 
reunion s current bank lender may require us to pay exorbitant fees and cause us to incur significant incremental costs again since entering into the boa facilities  we have incurred significant incremental costs related to our bank financing 
these costs total million  including million paid to boa relating to amendment and overadvance fees and approximately million in default interest 
the additional incremental costs included legal fees  audit and consultant fees and reappraisal costs 
these costs have negatively affected our liquidity 
if we do not refinance our boa credit facilities  they could continue to strain our liquidity with incremental fees and costs

whereas  eitf requires an estimated liability to be recognized for exit or disposal activities at the date an entity commits to an exit plan 
this statement will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with earlier application encouraged

in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin expands the disclosure requirements related to guarantees and requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of guarantees 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions will be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued after december  the disclosure provisions are effective for financial statement periods ending after december  because our financing agreements prohibit us from guaranteeing  either directly or otherwise  the indebtedness of others  the adoption of fin is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations

the major raw material used by plastics is thermoplastic polymers 
these materials are available from a number of suppliers 

prices for these materials are affected by changes in market demand  and there can be no assurances that prices for these and other raw materials will not increase in the future 

reunion industries contracts with its plastics customers generally provide that such price increases can be passed through to its customers 
a change in raw material prices would affect results of operations by approximately  reunion industries operating results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on debt that carries variable interest rates 
the variable rate debt was approximately million at december   which is representative of balances outstanding during the year 
a change in interest rates would affect results of operations by approximately
