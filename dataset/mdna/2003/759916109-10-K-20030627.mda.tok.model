item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
when used in this report  the words intend  anticipate  believe  estimate  plan and expect and similar expressions as they relate to us are included to identify forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements and are a result of certain factors  including those set forth under certain factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are engaged in the development of new products for profound pediatric developmental disorders 
our therapeutic product candidates are secretin for autism and schizophrenia  ctla ig for autoimmune disorders and uridine for neurologic and metabolic diseases 
these products are synthetic forms of naturally occurring substances which may correct improperly regulated biological processes with minimal toxicity or side effects 
our product candidates have the potential to produce clinical benefits not attainable with any existing drug in diseases for which there are few alternative therapies or treatments 
our business strategy is to partially fund the development of our proprietary therapeutic products with the profits derived from the sales of our specialty pharmaceutical products protein a and secreflo tm 
this will enable us to independently advance our proprietary drug development programs while at the same time minimizing our operating losses 
we may also seek corporate partners for development or marketing of our therapeutic product candidates 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit and activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the company does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
in response to a growing number of companies announcing plans to record expenses for the fair value of stock options  sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of fas to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation 
the amendments to statement in paragraphs a e of this statement is effective for our fiscal year ending march  the company believes that adoption of this statement did not have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   except for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of nonpublic entities 
the company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the securities and exchange commission requires that reporting companies discuss their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one that is important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and operating results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have identified the policies and estimates below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this report 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition the company applies staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab to its revenue arrangements 
the company generates product revenues from the sale of its protein a products to customers in the pharmaceutical and process chromatography industries  and from the sale of secreflo tm  the first synthetic version of the hormone secretin  to hospital based gastroenterologists 
in accordance with sab  the company recognizes revenue related to product sales upon shipment of the product to the customer as long as there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
license and research revenue derived from collaborative arrangements is recognized as earned under cost plus fixed fee contracts  or on a straight line basis over the term of contract  which approximates when work is performed and costs are incurred 
research expenses in the accompanying statements of operations include funded and unfunded expenses 
in addition  under certain contracts  the company recognizes research and development milestones as they are achieved assuming the milestone is deemed to be substantive 
impairment analysis of long lived assets during  under the terms of a licensing agreement with chirhoclin  inc crc we made a milestone payment to crc that consisted of  in cash and  shares of our common stock 
we have recorded the fair value of the shares issued   and the cash paid of  as a long term intangible asset 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
beginning in april  we began to amortize this intangible asset to cost of revenue over the remaining term of the license  approximately seven years 
in october  we commenced commercial shipment of secreflo tm  our synthetic version of the hormone secretin 
we amortized  during the year ended march  at march   in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we performed an impairment analysis of this intangible asset in order to determine if an impairment loss existed and should be recognized 
the impairment analysis consisted of an evaluation of the expected cash flows from the sale of secreflo tm over the term of the license and also included various assumptions and estimates concerning selling price  cost and volume of unit sales 
we concluded that there was no impairment loss as of march  we believe that our assumptions and estimates are reasonable  however  actual results could differ from these estimates 
clinical trial estimates our clinical development trials related to our proprietary drug products are primarily performed by outside parties 
it is not unusual at the end of each accounting period to estimate both the total cost of the trials and the percent completed as of that accounting date 
we then need to adjust our estimates when final invoices are received 
to date  these adjustments have not been material to our financial statements  and we believe that the estimates that we made as of march  are reflective of the actual expenses incurred as of that date 
however  readers should be cautioned that the possibility exists that the timing or cost of certain trials might be longer or shorter or cost more or less than we have estimated and that the associated financial adjustments would be reflected in future periods 
results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared with fiscal year ended march  total revenue total revenue for the fiscal year was  as compared to  in fiscal  resulting in an increase of  or 
during fiscal year we commenced selling secreflo tm  a diagnostic product that is marketed in the us to hospital based gastroenterologists 
in addition  this increase in product sales is attributable to increased demand from value added resellers who incorporate our protein a products into their proprietary antibody purification systems  which they sell to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry

this increase is largely attributable to increased staffing  investor relations and litigation expenses partially offset by a reimbursement by crc of premarketing and launch expenses associated with the launch of secreflo tm 
we anticipate that sg a expenses will increase as our litigation activities continue and an expected increase in marketing expenses as we expand our commercial operations 
investment income investment income for fiscal and  was approximately  and  respectively  a decrease of  or in this decrease is attributable to lower average funds available for investment and lower interest rates during fiscal as compared to fiscal we expect interest income to vary based on changes in the amount of funds invested and fluctuation of interest rates

this decrease is attributable to lower average funds available for investment and lower interest rates during fiscal compared to fiscal liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities and revenues derived from product sales  collaborative research agreements  government grants  and payments received from licensing and royalty agreements 
at march  we had cash and marketable securities of  compared to  at march  our operating activities in used cash of approximately  consisting of the net loss from operations for the year of  and a decrease in accounts payable of  these uses of cash were offset by non cash charges of  for depreciation and amortization and a decrease in accounts receivable of  a decrease in inventory of  a decrease in prepaid expenses of  and an increase in accrued expenses of  during fiscal  we purchased  of capital equipment  consisting of laboratory and office equipment 
in may  a certain investor purchased approximately million of our common stock through a private placement of  shares 
repligen received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting the estimated expenses of the transaction 
we have leased  pursuant to a ten year lease agreement  a new corporate headquarters in waltham  massachusetts 
we anticipate that this new facility will increase operating efficiencies and manufacturing capacity to meet the growing demand for our protein a products  and to better meet corporate goals and objectives 
we relocated to this facility in may in connection with this lease agreement  a letter of credit in the amount of  was issued to our landlord 
in october  this letter of credit was reduced to  the letter of credit is collateralized by a certificate of deposit held by the bank that issued the letter of credit

also pursuant to such license agreement  we issued to chirhoclin approximately   shares of our common stock in fiscal we have not granted registration rights to chirhoclin with respect to the shares issued under the license agreement 
in addition  under the terms of the licensing agreement with chirhoclin  if the fda approves the nda for human secretin diagnostic  we will be required to pay chirhoclin future milestones in cash 
we will also be required to pay royalties on sales of both synthetic porcine and human products 
we expect to incur significantly higher costs in fiscal as a result of the expansion of research and development costs associated with the clinical trials of our proprietary drug candidates and the commercialization of our diagnostic product  secreflo tm 
we believe that we have sufficient resources to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twenty four months 
should we need to secure additional financing to meet our future liquidity requirements  we may not be able to secure such financing  or obtain such financing on favorable terms because of the volatile nature of the biotechnology marketplace 
at march   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and research and development credit carryforwards of approximately  to reduce future federal income taxes  if any 
the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates  beginning in  if not used 
net operating loss carryforwards and available tax credits are subject to review and possible adjustment by the internal revenue service and may be limited in the event of certain changes in the ownership interest of significant stockholders
