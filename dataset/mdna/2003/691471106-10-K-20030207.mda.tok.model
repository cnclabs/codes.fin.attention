the excess insurance carriers have advised the company that the retention is currently million 
the company believes that  under the terms of the policies  the retention is currently million  but the excess insurance carriers have not accepted this interpretation 
the policies do not cover taxes  fines or penalties imposed by law or the cost to comply with any injunctive or other non monetary relief or any agreement to provide any such relief 
the coverage under the policies is in addition to approximately million of coverage remaining under preexisting primary insurance that is not subject to the retention applicable to the excess insurance policies 
of the remaining million in primary insurance coverage  collectibility of some portion of million is in doubt because one of the company s directors and officers insurance carriers  reliance insurance company reliance  was placed in liquidation in october by the commonwealth court of pennsylvania 
accordingly  during the third quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million related to a provision for estimated insurance recoveries related to anticipated legal expenses that may not be recoverable from reliance 
reliance also insured million of the million excess insurance 
due to the liquidation of reliance  collectibility of some portion of million of the excess insurance would also be in doubt if the company makes a claim on that coverage

each of the amounts of million and million in the preceding sentence reflects the insurance carriers position regarding the current retention under the excess insurance 
under the company s interpretation of the policies  these amounts would be million and million  respectively 
in the event that the excess insurance carriers become liable to pay any losses under the policies  the company would be obligated to pay the carriers an additional premium of million 
on september   judge brieant agreed to hold a settlement conference on november  with parties to the securities class actions and the excess insurance carriers 
in view of the inherent risks and uncertainties of litigation and the related time and expense  and in anticipation of the settlement conference  the company communicated to the plaintiffs and the insurance carriers the company s willingness to pay million 
this offer reflects the full amount of the current retention under the insurance carriers interpretation of the excess insurance policies 
as a result  the company has recorded a net liability and pre tax charge of million against earnings in the third quarter of this million charge represents the company s settlement offer  less million that the company estimates would be available and collectible under its primary directors and officers insurance 
if a settlement is reached and the total settlement amount exceeds million  the amount of co payments by the company required under the excess insurance policies and the amount  if any  not collected from reliance under the excess insurance would depend on the terms and total amount of any settlement 
at the present time  no total settlement amount beyond million can be reasonably estimated 
accordingly  the company has not recorded a liability for any co payments required by the excess insurance or any amount not collected from reliance 
also  in the event the excess insurance carriers contribute any amount to a settlement  the company would be obligated to pay the million additional premium referred to above 
at this time  there is no assurance that a settlement will be reached 
accordingly  the company has not recorded a liability for the additional premium payment 
there can be no assurance as to the terms of any settlement  or that the court would approve any such settlement 
if no settlement is reached and approved  the securities class actions would proceed to trial  and  at the present time  no amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
accordingly  the company has not recorded a net liability for a potential unfavorable judgment or settlement costs in excess of million 
there can be no assurance as to the ultimate result in this litigation

the proceeds of the new term loan were used  along with available company cash  to fund the recapitalization 
the company has not drawn on the revolver 
the agreement governing the senior credit facilities the credit agreement  provides for scheduled quarterly repayments of principal of the new term loan with a final maturity of june the credit agreement provides for voluntary prepayments of principal and voluntary reductions in commitments under the revolver without penalty of a minimum amount of million and mandatory prepayments of principal from proceeds upon the occurrence of certain events 
mandatory prepayments of principal and or reductions in the revolver are required from the net proceeds from the sale of assets  subject to certain exceptions  of the net proceeds from certain equity issuances  and the net proceeds from the issuance of debt securities

the company is subject to various contracts with certain health care providers  facilities and the federal government for the provision of health care services to its members 
such contracts involve payments to or from the company  generally on a monthly basis  in the ordinary course of business and are not included in the above table 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the company s management to make a variety of estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect  among other things  the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results can differ from the amounts previously estimated  which were based on the information available at the time the estimates were made 
the critical accounting policies described below are those that the company believes are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and which require management to make subjective and or complex judgments 
critical accounting policies cover matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
the company has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of the board of directors 
the company believes that its critical accounting policies include revenue recognition including the estimation of bad debt and retroactivity reserves  medical costs payable including reserves for incurred but not reported or paid claims  the carrying value of investments and accounting for contingent liabilities 
revenue recognition commercial membership contracts are generally established on a yearly basis subject to cancellation by the employer group  individual or the company upon days written notice 
premiums  including premiums from both commercial and governmental programs  are due monthly and are recognized as revenue during the month in which the company is obligated to provide services to members  and are net of estimated terminations of members and groups 
premiums collected in advance of the coverage period are recorded as unearned revenue 
premiums receivable are presented net of valuation allowances for estimated uncollectible amounts  including retroactive membership adjustments  based on known activities and balances and on historical trends 
the company receives premium payments from cms on a monthly basis for its medicare membership 
membership and category eligibility are periodically reconciled with cms and could result in revenue adjustments 
all other material revenue is generated from investments 
the company evaluates the collectibility of its premiums receivable based on a combination of factors 
these estimates are based on the company s assessment of the collectibility of specific accounts  the aging of premiums receivable  historical retroactivity trends  bad debt write offs and other known factors 
if economic or industry trends change beyond the company s estimates or if there is a deterioration in financial condition of a major group or account  increases in the reserve for uncollectible accounts may result 
at december   the company maintained reserves for billing adjustments of million compared with million at december   and reserves for doubtful accounts of million at december  and the reserve for billing adjustments was reduced during based on reduced levels of net retroactivity experienced over the last two years as a result of the company receiving billing and member change information on a more timely basis 
medical costs payable the company contracts with various health care providers for the provision of covered medical care services to its members and primarily compensates those providers on a fee for service basis and makes other payments pursuant to certain risk sharing arrangements 
the company also bears the risk of health care expenses for covered services provided by non contracted providers to members 
costs of health care and medical costs payable for health care services provided to members are estimated by management based on evaluations of providers claims submitted and provisions for ibnr 
the company s liability for medical costs payable is also affected by delegation  capitation and risk transfer arrangements  including  without limitation  certain diagnostic testing  disease management and ancillary services  physician and other health care groups and arrangements relating to the company s medicare business generally associated with specific hospitals 
in determining the liability for medical costs payable  the company accounts for the financial impact of the transfer of risk for certain members and the experience of risk sharing providers who may be entitled to credits from oxford for favorable experience or subject to deductions for accrued deficits as well as the impact of incentive arrangements and reserves for estimated settlements 
levels of unpaid claims may also vary based in part on working capital management 
the company estimates the provision for ibnr using standard actuarial loss development methodologies applied to loss development data summarized on the basis of the month services are rendered and the month claims are paid  processed or received  and considers other items including  without limitation  historical levels of denied claims  medical cost trends  seasonal patterns and changes in membership mix 
these estimates are reviewed by the company s external auditors and state regulatory authorities on a periodic basis 
the estimates for submitted claims and ibnr are made on an accrual basis and adjusted in future periods as necessary 
adjustments to prior period estimates  if any  are included in the current period 
medical costs payable also reflects payments required by or anticipated benefits from certain state regulated risk allocation pools and state health care public policy initiatives 
the risk allocation pools include the new york market stabilization pool affecting small employer group and individual products  the new york stop loss pools  the connecticut small employer reinsurance pool and new jersey assessments related to the individual product market 
certain of the risk allocation pools have  and in the future may be  amended in ways more or less favorable to the company and may be the target of legal challenges by insurers or other parties 
the financial impact to the company of the new york market stabilization pool is a function of how the company compares to the entire market relative to the factors defined in the regulations 
in this case  the company considers a range of possible outcomes and establishes its liability or receivable from the pools based on its consideration of the overall health insurance market in new york and certain other factors that may ultimately impact current estimates 
key data considered in developing the company s range of outcomes includes the small group and individual enrollment of its competitors by product type and the risk profile of the company s membership by product 
the range of outcomes also considers the likely differences between the risk profile of small group hmo and small group pos and ppo membership 
management believes this may ultimately be the key determinant of results 
the dominant position of the company in the new york city area with respect to the small group market and the relative attractiveness of the company s provider networks are also key considerations 
final results for any given year cannot be known with certainty until data submissions by all hmos and insurers have been audited by the state or its designee 
as a result  it is not possible to precisely forecast this outcome in advance of actual results 
final results related to the new york market stabilization pools for the period to may differ significantly from current estimates 
considering the major factors that affect the outcome of the pooling mechanism as described above  and particularly the company s dominance in the new york city area  results for each year may vary from having a liability to the pool of approximately million to having a receivable from the pool of approximately million 
at december   the company has established reserves of approximately million  million and million related to the  and pool years  respectively  and a receivable of approximately million related to from the new york stabilization pools 
the company has also established receivables of approximately million and million at december  for the and pool years  respectively  related to the new york stop loss pools 
management believes that the current net receivable established as of december   related to the pool years through represent its best estimate in light of the limited current information available 
also included in medical costs payable are i estimated liabilities for new york s graduate medical education gme and hospital bad debt and charity care bdcc programs  which are state health care public policy initiatives aimed at defraying the costs of other health care providers  such as hospitals  ii amounts due to the company s pharmacy benefit manager pbm  and iii estimated liabilities for various medical contracts between the company and certain current and former providers  some of which are currently in dispute 
for a further description of the risk allocation pools and the state health care public policy initiatives referenced above  see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements 
management believes that the amount of medical costs payable is adequate to cover the company s ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of december   however  actual claim payments and other items may differ from established estimates 
assuming a hypothetical difference between the company s december  estimates of medical costs payable and actual costs payable  net earnings for the year ended december  would increase or decrease by approximately million and diluted earnings per share would increase or decrease by approximately per share 
the following table shows the components of the change in medical costs payable for the years ended december   and in millions balances as of january  business purchases components of health care services expense estimated costs incurred estimate changes health care services expense payments for health care services related to current year prior year total paid balances as of december  balance at december related to current year prior years total included in estimate changes are favorable development of prior years estimated medical costs of approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively  estimate changes in new york market stabilization pool reserves and stop loss pool recoveries of approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively  and claim recoveries of approximately million in the components of medical costs payable were as follows at december  and in millions amounts relating to claims incurred during as of december  total and prior ibnr and medical claims reserves pharmacy pbm payable stabilization and stop loss pools  bdcc and gme reserves  net other reserves amounts relating to claims incurred during as of december  total and prior ibnr and medical claims reserves pharmacy pbm payable stabilization and stop loss pools  bdcc and gme reserves  net other reserves investments investments are classified as either available for sale or held to maturity 
investments that the company has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are designated as held to maturity and are stated at amortized cost 
the company has determined that all other investments might be sold prior to maturity to support its investment strategies 
accordingly  these other investments are classified as available for sale and are stated at fair value based on quoted market prices 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale investments are excluded from earnings and are reported in accumulated other comprehensive earnings loss  net of income tax effects where applicable 
realized gains and losses are determined on a specific identification basis and are included in results of operations 
investment income is accrued when earned and included in investment and other income 
contingent liabilities the company and certain of its former officers and present and former directors are currently defendants in certain securities class actions 
the company  in the opinion of management with the advice of external counsel  has substantial defenses to the plaintiffs claims and may ultimately prevail if these matters are brought to trial 
in view of the inherent risks and uncertainties of litigation  however  and in anticipation of a settlement conference held in november  the company communicated to the plaintiffs and the insurance carriers the company s willingness to pay million 
this offer reflects the full amount of the current retention under the insurance carriers interpretation of the excess insurance policies 
as a result  the company recorded a net liability and pre tax charge of million against earnings in the third quarter of this million charge represents the company s settlement offer less million  classified as other current receivables in the company s consolidated balance sheet  that the company estimates would be available and collectible under its primary directors and officers insurance 
the company  its excess insurance carriers and the plaintiffs have not been able to reach a settlement in the securities class actions 
on december   judge brieant scheduled a trial to begin on march  if the securities class actions are not settled  the class actions will go to trial 
in anticipation of additional legal fees and other expenses related to trial  the company recorded an additional net liability and pretax charge of million in the fourth quarter of at the present time  no total settlement amount beyond million can be reasonably estimated 
if a settlement is not reached  or if the court does not approve any such settlement  the securities class actions would proceed to trial  and  at the present time  no amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
accordingly  the company has not recorded a net liability for a potential unfavorable judgment or settlement costs in excess of million 
there can be no assurance as to the ultimate result in this litigation 
the company is also subject to the litigation described in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements and in legal proceedings 
because of the nature of the company s business  the company is routinely involved in various other disputes  legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations 
liabilities are recorded for estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters 
these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering the company s insurance coverages for such matters 
management does not believe that any of such other matters currently threatened or pending will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company s assumptions or the effectiveness of the company s strategies related to these proceedings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december   includes a significant amount of assets whose fair values are subject to market risk 
since a substantial portion of the company s investments are in fixed income securities  interest rate fluctuations represent the largest market risk factor affecting the company s consolidated financial position 
interest rates are managed within a tight duration band  generally averaging to years  and credit risk is managed by investing in us government obligations  corporate debt and asset and mortgage backed securities with high average quality ratings and maintaining a diversified sector exposure within the debt securities portfolio 
the company s investment policies are subject to revision based upon market conditions and the company s cash flow and tax strategies  among other factors 
the company continues to require a high credit rating  a or higher  and maintains an average rating of aa on the overall portfolio 
in order to determine the sensitivity of the company s investment portfolio to changes in market risk  valuation estimates were made on each security in the portfolio using a duration model 
duration models measure the expected change in security market prices arising from hypothetical movements in market interest rates 
convexity further adjusts the estimated price change by mathematically correcting the changes in duration as market interest rates shift 
the model used industry standard calculations of security duration and convexity as provided by third party vendors such as bloomberg and yield book 
for certain structured notes  callable corporate notes  and callable agency bonds  the duration calculation utilized an option adjusted approach  which helps to ensure that hypothetical interest rate movements are applied in a consistent way to securities that have embedded call and put features 
the model assumed that changes in interest rates were the result of parallel shifts in the yield curve 
therefore  the same basis point change was applied to all maturities in the portfolio 
the change in valuation was tested using positive and negative adjustments in yield of and basis points 
hypothetical immediate increases of and basis points in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of the company s investments in debt securities as of december  by approximately million and million  respectively compared to million and million as of december   respectively 
hypothetical immediate decreases of and basis points in market interest rates would increase the fair value of the company s investment in debt securities as of december  by approximately million and million  respectively compared to million and million as of december   respectively 
because duration and convexity are estimated rather than known quantities for certain securities  there can be no assurance that the company s portfolio would perform in line with the estimated values 
the year over year variation in the portfolio s sensitivity to changes in interest rates is a function of increased investment balances and an increase in the average duration of the portfolio
