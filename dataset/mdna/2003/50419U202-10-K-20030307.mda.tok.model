overview nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the basis of presentation includes management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for each of the separate companies  lq corporation and lq properties  on a consolidated basis 
our management believes that the lq corporation s consolidated presentation is most informative to holders of our common stock 
general nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we are a leading limited service lodging company providing clean and comfortable rooms at affordable prices in convenient locations 
we are one of the largest owner operators of limited service hotels in the united states 
we owned and operated la quinta reg  inns and la quinta inn nbsp  amp  suites reg  containing approximately  rooms in states as of december nbsp  we strive to design and operate hotels that attract both business and leisure travelers seeking quality rooms that are generally comparable to those of mid price  full service hotels  but at lower average room rates 
we believe that by not providing full service  management intensive facilities and services  such as in house restaurants  cocktail lounges  or room service  that typically carry high fixed costs and low margins  we are able to deliver a product that satisfies our customers needs and price expectations  while also permitting us to concentrate on the variable cost structure and the high margin nature of our limited service product 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in addition to owning and operating our hotel properties  we began  in late  to license the use of our proprietary brand names  including la quinta reg  la quinta inns reg  and la quinta inn nbsp  amp  suites reg  in return for royalty and other fees through franchise agreements with franchisees 
as of december nbsp   our franchisees operated la quinta inns reg  and la quinta inn nbsp  amp  suites reg  representing approximately  rooms under our brands 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as of december nbsp   we held approximately  of healthcare related investments 
consistent with our intention to focus on the lodging industry  the remaining healthcare operations and assets in our portfolio have been divested pursuant to our healthcare asset disposition strategy 
we were successful in selling these assets to other healthcare real estate investors or to the operators of the facilities 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  over the last three years  we have undergone significant financial and strategic changes 
in january nbsp  we began a strategy of selling non lodging real estate assets in order to focus on our lodging business 
as a result of that change in strategy  we replaced substantially all of our senior management with executives who have  on average  approximately nbsp  years of experience in lodging and lodging related industries 
over the last three years  we have improved the operations of our lodging assets  including the reduction of costs and the introduction of a franchising program 
during that period  we also have sold approximately nbsp  billion of our non lodging assets  with proceeds from those sales applied to reduce indebtedness and strengthen our balance sheet 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  on december nbsp   our shareholders approved certain proposals which permitted us to restructure the existing organization of our companies by merging a newly formed  wholly owned subsidiary of lq corporation  with and into lq properties  with lq properties surviving the restructuring and becoming a subsidiary controlled by lq corporation while continuing its status as a reit 
the new structure went into effect on january nbsp  we believe the restructuring  which was proposed primarily to address the challenges imposed by federal tax legislation on our previous grandfathered paired share reit structure  will enable us to grow our lodging real estate portfolio  management operations and brand franchising program without the restrictions imposed by this federal tax legislation 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as part of our continued focus on the improvement of revenue performance  we launched our redesigned loyalty program on september nbsp   called la quinta returns reg 
while the previous program allowed members to earn free stay certificates  the new returns program allows members to earn points that can be redeemed for a variety of rewards  in addition to free stay certificates 
in addition  we added several new electronic distribution channels during the year and are currently expanding and reshaping our sales force to put more emphasis on local sales efforts 
these programs are anticipated to increase our costs in la quinta corporation  consolidated results of operations comparison of year ended december nbsp  to year ended december nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we earn revenue primarily by owning and operating la quinta inns and la quinta inn nbsp  amp  suites as well as licensing the use of our brand in return for license and other fees under our franchise program

nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  font size net loss available to common shareholders increased by  or per diluted common share  to  or per diluted common paired share  for the year ended december nbsp   compared to a net loss of  or per diluted common paired share  for the year ended december nbsp  the increase in net loss available to common shareholders was primarily due to the following charges in  a one time charge of approximately  recorded in january nbsp  as a result of our restructuring to establish the net deferred tax liability of la quinta and recognize the future impact of temporary differences between book value and tax basis of lodging and healthcare assets and liabilities  including nols of lq properties and lq corporation   a charge of approximately  recorded in january nbsp  as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle to reflect an adjustment to goodwill as a result of the implementation of sfas no

nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the effect of these charges on net loss available to common shareholders for was partially offset by the following charges taken in  a charge of approximately  recorded in december nbsp  as a result of our restructuring to write off the carrying value of our paired share intangible  and  impairment charges amounting to approximately  taken during to write down the carrying value of certain property  plant and equipment as well as mortgages and other notes receivable

in addition  lodging revenues include franchise fees charged to franchisees for operating under the la quinta brand name and using our hotel designs  operating systems and procedures 
lodging revenues also include approximately  in revenues related to telematrix  a provider of telephones  software and equipment for the lodging industry 
the decrease in lodging revenues was primarily due to a decrease in room revenues  which accounts for of lodging revenues 
room revenue is dictated by demand  measured as occupancy percentage  pricing  measured as average daily rate or adr  and the level of available room inventory 
room revenues decreased during the year ended december nbsp  compared to the year ended december nbsp  due to several factors  including but not limited to  continuing decreases in demand resulting from the downturn in the national economy and the aftermath of the september nbsp  terrorist attacks on the united states 
business and leisure travel have continued to lag during the year of as companies have reduced corporate travel and the demand from leisure travelers has remained weak 
this reduced demand was reflected in the decrease in our occupancy percentage by nbsp  percentage points to for the year ended december nbsp  compared to for the year ended december nbsp    continuing declines in the percentage of full rate customers and reductions in rates in response to decreased demand 
as a result  our adr decreased  or  to for the year ended december nbsp  compared to for the year ended december nbsp   and  sale of hotel properties during caused decreases in room revenues for the year ended december nbsp  compared to the year ended december nbsp  available room inventory decreased by  room nights due to the sale of nine hotels during the year of the impact on room revenues during the year ended december nbsp  due to such sales was approximately  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  these decreases were partially offset by an increase in franchising related revenue of approximately  franchise revenue has increased and is expected to increase in connection with the expansion of our franchise program 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  font size net revenue per available room  or revpar  which is the product of adr and occupancy percentage  decreased  or  to for the year ended december nbsp  compared to for the year ended december nbsp  revpar declined as a result of the above mentioned factors 
we expect these weak demand trends to continue into the first half of a name page dm nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  other revenues  which include revenues from leasing and mortgage financing on healthcare real estate  decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december nbsp   compared to  for the year ended december nbsp  the decrease in other revenues was primarily the result of the sale of certain healthcare assets and repayment of healthcare mortgages during the year of the revenue during the year ended december nbsp  from assets remaining in our healthcare portfolio at december nbsp  was  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  font size direct lodging operating expenses decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december nbsp  compared to  for the year ended december nbsp  direct lodging operating expenses include costs directly associated with the operation of the hotels such as direct labor  utilities  and hotel supplies 
direct lodging operating costs decreased during the year ended december nbsp  due to our continued emphasis on cost control  the decrease in occupancy and available rooms which resulted in the reduction of certain variable costs during the year ended december nbsp  compared to the year ended december nbsp  such as  salaries and related benefits decreased  or  and  other variable expenses  including supplies  travel agency commissions  purchased services  guest services and vehicle and credit card processing costs decreased by  or 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in addition  energy costs decreased by  for the year ended december nbsp  compared to the year ended december nbsp  as a result of deregulation in certain markets as well as other decreases in energy rates coupled with a decrease in usage resulting from the decline in occupancy 
these decreases in direct lodging operating expenses were partially offset by increases in advertising and repair and maintenance of  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  font size other lodging expenses increased by  or  to  for the year ended december nbsp  compared to  for the year ended december nbsp  other lodging expenses include property taxes  insurance costs  certain returns loyalty program expenses  franchise program costs  corporate allocations charged to our owned hotel operations based on a percentage of room revenue and certain costs related to our telematrix subsidiary 
the net increase in other lodging expenses was comprised of  increases in franchise related expenses of approximately  franchise expenses have increased and will continue to increase in connection with the expansion of our franchising program   increases in the la quinta returns loyalty program expenses of approximately  primarily related to the redesign of the program which included a  one time charge incurred in connection with conversion of the program to a point system offset by decreases in the estimated liability for free night certificates issued under the old program   increases in insurance costs of approximately  the events of september nbsp  th and their aftermath are expected to further negatively impact our ability to obtain  and the cost of  general liability and property insurance coverage  and  offsetting decreases in telematrix costs of sales and marketing and selling expenses of  and a decline in corporate overhead allocations of  related to services provided to our owned hotels that are based on a percentage of hotel revenues 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  font size general and administrative expenses increased by approximately  or  to  for the year ended december nbsp  compared to  for the year ended december nbsp  general and administrative expenses include  among other costs  information services  legal  finance and accounting costs  sales  marketing  reservations  human resources and corporate operations 
the increase in general and administrative costs primarily relates to additional expenses related to sales and marketing initiatives  new quality assurance initiatives  certain litigation costs  compensation expense related to an executive supplemental retirement plan as well as a decline in corporate allocations related to services provided to our owned hotels that are based on a percentage of hotel revenues 
these increases were offset by decreases in expenses incurred to support our healthcare operations during the year ended december nbsp  we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase due to planned expansion of our sales force  additional information systems costs and the continued decline in corporate overhead allocations related to services provided to our owned hotels that are based on a percentage of hotel revenues 
depreciation and amortization expense nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  depreciation  amortization and write offs increased by  or  to  for the year ended december nbsp  compared to  for the year ended december nbsp  this increase is primarily due to early retirement losses of  on hotel capital assets replaced during our ongoing renovation program   of losses incurred on replacement of assets for maintenance of the hotels   of accelerated depreciation on a property under redevelopment   of write offs of certain internal and external software costs as well as additional depreciation related to new or redeveloped properties and new assets placed in service during our ongoing renovation program 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease of approximately  in depreciation related to the reclassification of certain healthcare and lodging properties to held for sale in interest  net nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  interest  net decreased by  or  to  during the year ended december nbsp  compared to  during the year ended december nbsp  the decrease in interest expense is due to the reduction of debt of  during the reduction of debt was the result of the application of proceeds generated from asset sales and mortgage repayments during in addition  interest expense for the year ended december nbsp  included a  charge to recognize the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the interest rate swap through income under sfas no

the decrease in interest expense during the year ended december nbsp   was partially offset by acceleration of our amortization of debt issuance costs of  in connection with the repayment of our term loan in june nbsp  impairment of property  plant and equipment  mortgages and other notes receivable nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  held for sale assets are classified as such based on results of our management s review of current facts and circumstances and our management having the authority and intent of entering into commitments for sale transactions that are expected to close in the following twelve months

as a result of the cumulative effect of implementation of sfas nbsp  we incurred a decrease in amortization of goodwill and a corresponding annual increase to net income of  for the year ended december nbsp  during september nbsp  we wrote off  of goodwill related to our telematrix telecommunications reporting unit due to continued decline in that reporting unit s operations and based on results of impairment tests conducted during the third quarter of as required by sfas nbsp  prior to implementation of the statement  goodwill and intangibles were amortized over their estimated useful lives 
subsequent to  we will no longer incur goodwill amortization expense 
write off of paired share intangible nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as a result of and federal tax legislation severely limiting our ability to acquire new real property interests and grow our franchising program  we implemented a restructuring which would enable us to no longer be considered a grandfathered paired share reit or stapled entities for federal income tax purposes 
on december nbsp   our shareholders approved this restructuring 
as a result  in december nbsp  we wrote off the  net book value of the intangible asset related to the grandfathered paired share structure 
income taxes nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as a result of our restructuring  we recorded a one time charge of approximately  in january nbsp  to establish the net deferred tax liability of la quinta and to recognize the future impact of temporary differences between the book value and tax basis of lodging and healthcare assets and liabilities  including nols of lq properties and lq corporation

nbsp  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas nbsp  in as a result of the adoption of sfas nbsp  gains and losses on long lived assets classified as held for sale subsequent to january nbsp   the effective date of sfas nbsp  will be classified as gains or losses from disposal of discontinued operations 
gains and losses on long lived assets classified as held for sale that were disposed of during the year ended december nbsp  and  have been classified in continuing operations because restatement of prior periods is not permitted under sfas nbsp  and no assets have been transferred to the held for sale category subsequent to december nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in  we adopted the provisions of sfas no

sfas nbsp  among other things  rescinds sfas  which required that gains and losses from extinguishment of debt be classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effects 
sfas nbsp  is to be applied in fiscal years beginning after may nbsp  and encourages early application of the rescission of sfas as a result  we have classified losses on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended december nbsp  of  and the gain on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended december nbsp  of  in other expense from continuing operations 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in january nbsp  we implemented sfas nbsp  which primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their initial recognition 
sfas nbsp  nbsp  prohibits the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  nbsp  requires testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on an annual basis for impairment and more frequently if the occurrence of an event or circumstance indicates an impairment  nbsp  requires that reporting units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill and nbsp  removes the forty year limitation on the amortization period of intangible assets that have finite lives 
implementation of the statement resulted in the following impact on goodwill and finite lived intangibles reported on our balance sheet  goodwill 
on january nbsp   we completed the two step process prescribed by sfas nbsp  for nbsp  testing for impairment and nbsp  determining the amount of impairment loss related to goodwill associated with our two reporting units la quinta lodging  carrying value and telematrix  nbsp  inc telecommunications  carrying value 
as a result  we recorded a charge to earnings that is reported as a cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle of  to reflect the adjustment to goodwill 
since goodwill is a permanent difference  the charge to earnings had no tax impact 
as a result of the cumulative effect of implementation  we incurred a decrease in amortization of goodwill and a corresponding annual increase to net income of  for the year ended december nbsp  in september nbsp  we tested the remaining carrying value of goodwill related to our telematrix telecommunications reporting unit for impairment due to continued decline in the unit 
as a result  we recorded a charge of  to write off the remaining goodwill balance for that reporting unit in the third quarter of  finite lived intangibles 
upon implementation of sfas nbsp  we identified finite lived intangible assets related to our lodging brands  la quinta inns reg  and la quinta inn nbsp  amp  suites reg 
as part of our restructuring  more fully described above  we determined that there was no indication of impairment on these finite lived intangible assets and assigned them a useful life of nbsp  years the remaining useful life of these intangibles was nbsp  years as of december nbsp  
this change in the useful life did not have a material impact on the results of our operations 
in addition  we have a finite lived intangible asset resulting from a five year non compete agreement executed as part of our acquisition of telematrix  nbsp  inc we have determined that there is no indication of impairment related to this asset and that the five year life assigned to the asset is appropriate

of the nbsp  million of letters of credit  approximately nbsp  million support insurance arrangements and nbsp  million guarantee the payment of principal and interest on industrial revenue bonds  which are the obligation of an unrelated third party 
the letter of credit supporting the industrial revenue bonds expired in january nbsp  because the bonds require full year extensions of the letter of credit and since our credit facility matures on may nbsp  without considering extension options  we did not renew the letter of credit 
as a result  we funded the repurchase of the bonds in january nbsp  this is similar to our action with respect to these bonds in june nbsp  which were subsequently followed by a reissuance of the bonds 
the guarantee of the bonds was a condition of the sale of a healthcare asset by us to the third party in september nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in addition  as of december nbsp   we had nbsp  million in net book value  after impairment adjustments  of lodging assets held for sale

cash flows from operating activities nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  our sale of assets  the downturn in the national economy and the aftermath of the terrorist attacks against the united states have had a negative impact upon our operating cash flows

our obligation to fund these commitments is contingent upon certain conditions set forth in the respective franchise or joint venture agreements 
at december nbsp   we had nbsp  million in outstanding commitments of financial assistance to various franchisees  of which nbsp  million has been funded 
the unamortized balance of amounts funded on incentive payments is included in other non current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
these agreements generally require that  in the event that the franchise relationship is terminated  the franchisee either repay the outstanding loan balance or unamortized portion of the incentive payment  or transfer to us any equipment  computer or other property purchased by the franchisee with the incentive payment 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we expect to provide funding for new investments through a combination of long term and short term financing including debt  equity and cash 
we may also provide funding for new investments through internally generated cash flow and the sale of select assets 
we may obtain long term financing through the issuance of equity securities  long term secured or unsecured notes  convertible debentures and the assumption of mortgage notes 
we may obtain short term financing through the use of our revolving line of credit  which may be replaced with long term financing as appropriate 
from time to time  we may utilize interest rate swaps to manage our variable interest rate exposure 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  on june nbsp   we entered into a credit agreement with a bank group  which provided a nbsp  million credit facility 
the credit facility consisted of a  nbsp  million revolving line of credit  and  nbsp  million term loan 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the revolving line of credit under the credit facility was subsequently increased in july nbsp  from nbsp  million to nbsp  million  which increased the total size of the credit facility from nbsp  million to nbsp  million 
the credit facility matures on may nbsp  and may be extended at our option under certain conditions 
the credit facility is secured by a pledge of stock of our subsidiaries and intercompany debt evidenced by promissory notes and contains a subjective acceleration clause contingent upon a material adverse effect 
we immediately used proceeds from the credit facility to pay off term debt maturing on july nbsp  of approximately nbsp  million under our prior credit facility 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  on march nbsp   we made a scheduled payment of approximately nbsp  million on the term loan 
on june nbsp   we repaid the entire remaining balance on the term loan of approximately nbsp  million with proceeds from the sale of our healthcare assets 
in addition to accrued interest  the credit facility required a prepayment premium of  or  which is included in other expense as a loss on early extinguishment of debt 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  approximately nbsp  million net of nbsp  million in outstanding letters of credit was available under the revolving line of credit at december nbsp  borrowings under the revolving line of credit currently bear interest at libor plus 
on august nbsp   we borrowed nbsp  million under the revolving line of credit at a rate of month libor plus and subsequently paid the entire amount on august nbsp  with proceeds from one healthcare asset sale 
on september nbsp   we borrowed nbsp  million under the revolving line of credit at the base rate option of prime plus and subsequently repaid the entire amount on september nbsp  with proceeds from operations 
at december nbsp   there were no borrowings under the revolving line of credit 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the credit facility contains several restrictive financial covenants as defined in the credit agreement of which we are in compliance with at december nbsp   and include the following  minimum lodging ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization   net debt to ebitda total leverage ratio   interest coverage ratio   fixed charge coverage ratio   net debt to total capitalization ratio  and  consolidated tangible net worth minimum 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the credit facility is collaterized by the stock of our subsidiaries and intercompany debt evidenced by notes 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we obtained an amendment to the credit facility on march nbsp   which relaxed the maximum total leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenants through march nbsp   and reduced the minimum lodging ebitda covenant to nbsp  million through december nbsp  the minimum lodging ebitda covenant increases to nbsp  million for and thereafter 
this may impact our ability to exercise any extension options under the credit agreement 
the amendment also included modifications to certain definitions and other provisions in the credit facility 
in addition to the financial covenants  the credit facility also includes limitations on capital expenditures  asset sales  secured debt  certain investments  common stock dividends  and debt and share repurchases 
in light of the decline in our lodging ebitda  it is unlikely that we will be able to meet all of our financial covenants under the credit facility  particularly the minimum lodging ebitda covenant in and beyond 
because it is unlikely that we will meet these covenants in  we intend to request a waiver or amendment from the bank group 
however  we cannot provide assurances that the bank group would be agreeable to such a waiver or amendment or that we will be able to extend the maturity of the credit facility 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  during the year ended december nbsp   we repaid approximately nbsp  million in principal on bonds and mortgages payable  which included a balloon payment of  on a mortgage  which matured on january nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  during the year ended december nbsp   we repaid approximately nbsp  million in principal on notes payable scheduled to mature or that were redeemable at the option of the holder in august nbsp  september nbsp  march nbsp  and august nbsp  and recorded a net loss on early extinguishment included in other expense during the year ended december nbsp  of approximately  in addition  during  we waived our purchase option on a nbsp  million capital lease asset and related obligation and as a result removed the asset and liability from the balance sheet 
the lease will be accounted for as an operating lease going forward and future payments on the lease will be recorded as rent expense

nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we have certain debt that is redeemable at the option of the holders in september nbsp  and august nbsp  we are currently reviewing our alternatives for additional financings to fund these maturities should the holders redeem them 
such options under consideration include issuing new senior unsecured debt  securitized debt  borrowings under the existing or a new revolver  new term debt  or a combination thereof 
there are no assurances that any of these alternatives will be available to us when and if this debt is redeemed or will contain terms that are attractive to us 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  if our notes due in the notes are still outstanding from and after august nbsp   the interest rate will increase by a spread amount over the current interest rate  which spread amount is determined by a bidding process involving up to five dealers in publicly traded securities and is based on the present value of the remaining principal and interest payments at a coupon rate from august nbsp   discounted at the rate of us treasury securities having maturities similar to the remaining term of the notes the interest rate to maturity

the trust is required to exercise the put option if a nbsp  the call holder fails to exercise the call option or b nbsp  the call holder exercises the call option but fails to make payment on the date required 
if the call holder exercises the call option but we do not repurchase the notes from the call holder or if the trust does not exercise the put option  from and after august nbsp  until august nbsp   the notes will remain an outstanding obligation of the company and will bear interest at the interest rate to maturity 
as of december nbsp   the company owned nbsp  million of the exercisable put option securities issued by the trust

nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  on july nbsp   our shelf registration statement on file with the sec became effective 
under the shelf registration statement  either or both of lq corporation and lq properties may offer and sell  from time to time  either separately  together  or in combination in one or more offerings  debt securities  which may be senior or subordinated   shares of common stock   shares of preferred stock   depositary shares  and  warrants exercisable for debt securities  common stock or preferred stock 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in conjunction with our decision to seek shareholder approval of our restructuring  our board of directors approved a nbsp  million share repurchase program to allow us to repurchase common and or preferred stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
as of december nbsp   we had repurchased approximately nbsp  million or  shares of our equity securities under the program 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we believe that our current various sources of capital  including cash on hand  operating cash flows  and expected proceeds from the sale of certain assets are adequate to finance our current operations  including capital expenditures which we currently expect to be approximately nbsp  million 
we have significant debt maturing in  assuming such debt is redeemed at the option of the holders 
in addition  our credit facility matures in may nbsp  if we are unable to elect available extension options 
as a result  we may need to raise capital  through one or more of the methods described above  in order to satisfy these debt maturities 
effects of certain events on lodging demand nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the potential threat of terrorist and the continued effect of the attacks on september nbsp  have negatively impacted general economic  market and political conditions 
the terrorist attacks and their aftermath  compounded with the slowing national economy  have resulted in substantially reduced demand for lodging for both business and leisure travelers across all lodging segments 
lodging demand has been  and is expected to continue to be  affected by the public s attitude towards the safety of travel and the international political climate 
the possibility of military action against iraq  events such as the terrorist attacks in the us on september nbsp  and the threat of additional attacks  and the resulting political instability and concerns over safety and security aspects of traveling  have had a significant adverse impact on lodging demand and may continue to do so in the future 
economic or political changes that reduce disposable income or consumer or business confidence may affect demand for hotel rooms  which in many cases are discretionary purchases 
decreases in lodging demand could lead to price discounting which  in turn  could reduce the profitability of our business 
these factors may also limit our ability to raise additional capital to meet debt maturities 
critical accounting policies and estimates nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  our consolidated financial statements of lq corporation and separate financial statements of lq properties have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which require our management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures and contingencies 
our management evaluates estimates used in preparation of its financial statements on a continual basis  including estimates related to the following carrying amount and classification of lodging real estate assets  potential impairment and recognition of sales nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we evaluate the carrying value and classification of all owned lodging assets on an ongoing basis 
the evaluation process includes a review of current facts and circumstances such as guest satisfaction scores  profitability  changing market conditions  and condition of the property 
as a result of this evaluation process  we identify properties we intend to sell and properties we intend to hold for use 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  with respect to properties we intend to sell  our management begins to initiate marketing efforts upon obtaining authority to sell the property 
the properties that we expect to sell within twelve months are reclassified as assets held for sale and depreciation of the asset ceases upon this reclassification 
we record impairment charges on these properties when the estimated fair value less costs to sell is less than the carrying amount of the property 
these assets are then monitored through the date of sale for potential adjustment based on the offers that we are willing to take under serious consideration and our continued review of facts and circumstances 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  for the assets that may take longer than one year to sell or for those assets we intend to hold and use  we estimate when the assets may be sold or otherwise disposed of 
we apply a probability weighted cash flow estimation approach to recovery of the carrying amount of each lodging asset held for use to determine if the undiscounted net cash flows exceed the carrying amount of the property 
if this test results in a loss  we then calculate an impairment loss on the lodging asset held for use by determining the excess of the property s carrying amount over our estimate of fair market value of the asset 
the fair value of those assets becomes the new cost basis and is depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as we sell the related assets  contracts are reviewed to determine if  a sale has been consummated   the buyer s investment is adequate   a complete transfer of risks and rewards has occurred  and  any contingencies or obligations on our part continue to exist 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as of december nbsp   we had lodging properties classified as held for use with a net book value of  and a related impairment balance of  and seven lodging properties and two parcels of land classified as held for sale with a net book value of  and a related impairment balance of  goodwill nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in january nbsp  we completed the two step process prescribed by sfas nbsp  for nbsp  testing for impairment and nbsp  determining the amount of impairment loss related to goodwill associated with our two reporting units la quinta lodging  carrying value and telematrix  nbsp  inc telecommunications  carrying value 
as a result  we recorded a charge to earnings that is reported as a cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle of  to reflect the adjustment to goodwill 
as a result of the cumulative effect of implementation  we incurred a decrease in amortization of goodwill and a corresponding annual increase to net income of  for the year ended december nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in september nbsp  we tested the remaining carrying value of goodwill related to our telematrix  nbsp  inc telecommunications reporting unit for impairment due to continued decline in the unit 
as a result  we recorded a charge of  to write off the remaining goodwill balance for that reporting unit in the third quarter of finite lived intangibles nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as of december nbsp   our balance sheet included two intangible assets totaling approximately  related to our lodging brands  la quinta inns reg  and la quinta inn nbsp  amp  suites reg  and a year non compete agreement 
upon implementation of sfas nbsp  we identified finite lived intangible assets related to our lodging brands  la quinta inns reg  and la quinta inn nbsp  amp  suites reg 
we assessed our intangible assets for impairment in accordance with sfas nbsp  the results of this analysis indicate that there was no impairment on these finite lived intangible assets and assigned them a useful life of nbsp  years the remaining useful life of these intangibles was nbsp  years as of december nbsp  
this change in the useful life did not have a material impact on the results of our operations 
in addition  we have a finite lived intangible asset resulting from a five year non compete agreement executed as part of our acquisition of telematrix  nbsp  inc we have determined that there is no indication of impairment related to this asset and that the five year life assigned to the asset is appropriate 
going forward  we will continue to test these intangibles for impairment annually or more frequently if the occurrence of an event or circumstance indicates impairment 
carrying value of trade and other receivables and related bad debt allowance and expense nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as of december nbsp   we had approximately  in trade receivables with a related bad debt allowance of  we continually review the aging of our trade receivables and provide a bad debt reserve for all balances over nbsp  days old 
we also consider other facts and circumstances such as impending bankruptcy of our customers  credit history  etc 
in determining whether additional trade receivable amounts should be reserved as uncollectible
