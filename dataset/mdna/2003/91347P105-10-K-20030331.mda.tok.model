item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general since inception  the company has been exclusively engaged  and for the foreseeable future expects to continue to be exclusively engaged  in funding and performing research and development activities related to oled technologies and associated materials  and in attempting to commercialize these technologies and materials 
the company has incurred significant losses since its inception  resulting in an accumulated deficit of  as of december  the rate of loss is expected to increase as the company s activities increase  and losses are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and until such time  if ever  as the company is able to achieve  from the commercial licensing of its oled technologies and sale of its oled materials  revenues that are sufficient to support its operations 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the company had a net loss attributable to holders of common stock of  or per share for the year ended december   compared to a net loss attributable to holders of common stock of  or per share for the year ended december  the increase in net loss attributable to holders of common stock is primarily attributed to o an increase in cash and non cash research and development expenses  o an increase in non cash interest expense on convertible promissory notes issued by the company in august  and the incurrence of non cash expenses relating to the conversion and extinguishment of these notes see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and the company earned  in contract research revenue from the us government in  compared to  in the increase is primarily due to the company s commencement of work under six new government contracts in  with work under four of these contracts beginning in the third and fourth quarters of in  contract revenue was derived from three government contracts  one of which was completed in the third quarter of in  contract revenue was derived from the following government contracts o  recognized under a month   phase i contract received from the us department of defense advanced research projects agency darpa  which commenced in june and was completed in december  o  recognized under a month   sbir phase ii contract received from the department of defense dod  which commenced in february  o  recognized under a  subcontract with princeton university  pursuant to a month   prime contract princeton university received from darpa  which commenced in june  however work on the contract commenced in  o  recognized under a month   cooperative agreement received from the us army research laboratories arl  which commenced in august  o  recognized under a month  sbir phase i contract received from the us department of the army  which commenced in february  o  recognized under a month   sbir phase i contract received from the us department of energy doe  which commenced in july  o  recognized under a subcontract with princeton university  pursuant to a month  prime contract princeton university received from arl  which commenced in july and o  recognized under a month   sbir phase i contract received from doe  which commenced in july the company earned  from its sales of oled materials for evaluation purposes in  compared to  in the increase in this amount is mainly due to an increased volume of oled materials purchased for evaluation by potential oled manufacturers  including the company s current joint development partners 
the company commenced sales of oled materials for evaluation purposes in during  the company received non refundable cash payments of  in the aggregate in connection with its joint development  technology development and evaluation and license agreements compared to  in the company recognized revenues of  of this amount as fees for technology development and evaluation  with the remainder being recorded as unearned revenue 
the increase in these payments resulted from the company entering into new agreements of this nature in and receiving additional amounts under such agreements that were in place during during  the company sold approximately million of it net operating losses nols to new jersey under the technology tax certificate transfer program 
the company received  for the sale of the nols and recorded it as other revenue 
the company has not sold any of its nols in the past but may sell more in the future 
the company incurred research and development expenses of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase is mainly attributed to the following o the company incurring costs in in the amount of  for further development and operation of the company s facility in ewing  new jersey  compared to  in such costs during the increase is mainly attributable to increased salaries and costs incurred in connection with  and as a result of  the expansion of this facility 
o the company incurring costs in in the amount of  for the preparation  filing and prosecution of patent applications and for other intellectual property rights protection  compared to  in such costs during the increase is attributable to increased number of patents filed in as compared to o the company incurring non cash charges in the amount of  during in connection with its development and license agreement with ppg industries  inc ppg  compared to  in similar charges during the increase is due to the company issuing  shares of its common stock  warrants to purchase  shares of its common stock to ppg and options to purchase  shares of its common stock to ppg employees for services performed in  as compared to the company having issued  shares of its common stock  warrants to purchase  shares of its common stock to ppg and options to purchase  of its common stock to ppg s employees for services performed in for further discussion  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
o the company incurring non cash charges in the amount of  during for options granted to its scientific advisory board the sab  compared to similar charges of  during for the vesting of warrants issued to the sab in and for options granted to the sab in the decrease is due mainly to the warrants issued in becoming fully vested in for further discussion  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
general and administrative expenses for the company were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in these expenses is mainly due to increased salaries and costs incurred in connection with  and as a result of  the expansion of the company s facility in ewing  new jersey 
the company also experienced an increase in marketing costs  including costs relating to public relations and shareholder services 
in september   of the  in convertible promissory notes that had been issued by the company in august the notes were converted into shares of the company s common stock  with the remaining amount being repaid by the company in cash 
as of the date of conversion and repayment  the  face value of the notes exceeded their then carrying value due to an unamortized original issuance discount oid and beneficial conversion feature bcf on the notes 
as a result  upon the conversion and repayment of the notes  the company recognized a non cash debt conversion and extinguishment expense of  related to the unamortized portion of the oid and bcf and the intrinsic value of the notes repurchased 
in the same period in  there were no such expenses 
for further discussion  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s interest expense was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to amortization of the original issuance discount oid and the beneficial conversion feature bcf of the notes 
for further discussion  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in september  the conversion price of the series b convertible preferred stock issued to motorola in september was adjusted in accordance with the certificate of designations for this stock 
the company accounted for this adjustment as a contingent beneficial conversion feature cbcf 
as a result  the company recorded the cbcf as a deemed dividend in the amount of  in  the adjustment resulted in a deemed dividend of  for further discussion  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in august  the company completed a private placement financing transaction with institutional investors for the purchase of the notes  convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase the company s common stock

year ended december  compared to year ended december  the company had a net loss attributable to common stock shareholders of  or per share for the year ended december   compared to a net loss attributable to common stock shareholders of  or per share for the year ended december  the increase in net loss attributable to common stock shareholders was primarily attributed to the following o an increase in cash and non cash research and development expenses  o an increase in non cash interest expenses due to convertible promissory notes issued by the company in august see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and o non cash deemed dividends associated with a private placement completed in august see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company earned  in contract research revenue from the us government in  compared to  in the increase was primarily due to the company being awarded and commencing work on additional government contracts 
in  contract revenue was derived primarily from the following government contracts o  recognized under an month   phase i contract received from darpa  which commenced in june  o  recognized under a month   sbir phase ii contract received from dod  which commenced in february  and o  recognized under a two year   phase ii contract from the national science foundation under the small business technology transfer program  which commenced in october and was completed in september the company earned  from its sales of oled materials for evaluation purposes in  compared to no such earnings in the company commenced these sales in during  the company received non refundable cash payments of  in the aggregate in connection with joint development and technology evaluation agreements  all of which was recorded as unearned revenue 
in  the company had no such agreements in place 
the company incurred research and development expenses of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was mainly attributed to the following o the company incurring costs in in the amount of  for the development and operation of the company s facility in ewing  new jersey  compared to  in such costs during the increase was mainly attributable to the expansion of the company s research and development team and increased costs associated with an additional  square feet added to the facility in april o the company incurring non cash charges in the amount of  during in connection with the development and license agreement with ppg  compared to  in similar charges during the increase was mainly due to timing of services performed  since work under this agreement had only commenced in october for further discussion  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
o the company incurring non cash charges of  for amortization of the company s acquired technology  compared to similar charges of  in the increase was due to the timing of the company s acquisition of this technology 
amortization commenced on the date of the acquisition 
for further discussion  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
o the company incurring non cash charges of  for warrants issued to the sab in and options granted to the sab in  compared to  in similar charges for the increase was due to the required accounting treatment for the vesting of warrants and the issuance of options 
the warrants became fully vested as of december  for further discussion  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
general and administrative expenses for the company were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses was mainly due to increased salaries and costs associated with expansion of the company s facility in ewing  new jersey and the company s hiring of additional employees 
in august  the company completed a private placement financing transaction with institutional investors for the purchase of the notes  convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase the company s common stock 
as a result of this financing transaction and the conversion of the preferred stock into shares of the company s common stock in december  the company recorded deemed dividends in the amount of  in in  the company recorded no such deemed dividends 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  and short term investments of  this compares to cash and cash equivalents of  short term investments of  and restricted cash of  as of december  during  cash used in operating activities was  as compared to  in this decreased use of cash in operating activities was mainly due to an increase in deferred license fees and deferred revenues 
in  the company received non refundable cash payments of  in the aggregate in connection with its new and existing joint development  technology development and evaluation and license agreements 
in  the company received non refundable cash payments of  in the aggregate in connection with its joint development and technology evaluation agreements  all of which was recorded as unearned revenue 
also during  the company received cash proceeds of  as a result of the exercise of warrants and options to purchase  shares of the company s common stock 
during  warrants and options to purchase  shares of the company s common stock were exercised  resulting in cash proceeds to the company of  during  warrants and options to purchase  shares of the company s common stock were exercised  resulting in cash proceeds to the company of  in august and september  the company completed registered direct offerings the offerings of  and  shares  respectively  of the company s common stock at per share and per share  respectively 
the offerings resulted in aggregate proceeds to the company of  net of  in costs associated with completion of the offerings 
in august  the company sold in a private placement transaction  shares of series c convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase shares of the company s common stock  resulting in net cash proceeds of  in december  the company completed the second tranche of this private placement by selling  shares of series d convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase shares of the company s common stock  resulting in additional net cash proceeds of  in december  all shares of series c and series d convertible preferred stock were converted into common stock 
for further discussion  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
in the same transaction  the company issued secured convertible promissory notes the notes that resulted in the company receiving restricted cash proceeds of  the notes 
in september   of the notes were converted into  shares of the company s common stock  with the balance of  of the notes being repaid by the company in cash 
as a result  the company received  in cash  net of costs associated with conversion and repayment of the notes  the use of which was previously restricted 
the company has no restricted cash as of december  in december  the company sold in a private placement  units  each unit consisting of one share of the company s common stock and one warrant with an exercise price of 
the units were issued at per unit and the transaction resulted in net cash proceeds to the company of  in the first quarter of  the company received additional net cash proceeds of  from the completion of this private placement transaction through the issuance of an additional  units 
in the fourth quarter of  the company commenced construction on the expansion of its current facility in ewing  new jersey 
this construction was completed in the first quarter of as of december   the company had incurred costs of  relating to the construction and purchase of equipment for the expansion 
working capital increased to  at december  from working capital of  at december  the net increase is due primarily to a decrease from conversion and repayment of the notes and an increase from the receipt of cash payments in connection with the company s joint development  technology development and evaluation and license agreements 
the company s net cash used in operating activities was   and  in  and  respectively 
non cash expenses related to the issuance of common stock  warrants and options  and the amortization of discounts relating to the issuance  conversion and repayment of convertible debt see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements were   and  in  and  respectively 
the company anticipates  based on management s internal forecasts and assumptions relating to its operations including assumptions regarding working capital requirements of the company  the progress of research and development  the availability and amount of other sources of funding available to princeton university for research relating to the oled technology and the timing and costs associated with the preparation  filing and prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement of intellectual property rights  that it has sufficient cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to meet its obligations into management believes that potential additional financing sources for the company include long term and short term borrowings  public and private sales of the company s equity and debt securities and receipt of cash upon the exercise of warrants 
it should be noted  however  that substantial additional funds will be required in the future for research  development and commercialization of the company s oled technologies and oled materials  to obtain and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights in these technologies and materials  and for working capital and other purposes  the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain 
for example  under the company s research agreement with princeton university  the company is required to pay princeton university  per year through july there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to the company when needed  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
critical accounting policies management believes the following represent the company s critical accounting policies revenue recognition contract research revenues represent reimbursements by the us government for all or a portion of the research and development costs the company incurs related to its government contracts 
revenues are recognized proportionally as the research and development costs are incurred or as defined milestones are achieved 
development chemical revenues represent sales of oled materials to potential oled manufacturers for evaluation and product development purposes 
these revenues are recognized at the time of shipment and passage of title to the oled materials 
the customer does not have the right to return the materials 
the company also receives non refundable advanced license payments under certain of its joint development and technology evaluation agreements 
these payments are deferred until a license agreement is executed or negotiations have ceased and there is no likelihood of executing a license agreement with the other party 
if a license agreement is executed  these revenues will be recorded over the expected life of the licensed technology  otherwise  they will be recorded at the time negotiations with the other party show no further likelihood of success 
valuation of acquired technology the company continually reviews its acquired oled technologies for events or changes in circumstances that might indicate the carrying value of such technologies may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could cause impairment include  but are not limited to  significant changes in the company s anticipated future use of these technologies or the company s overall business strategy as it pertains to the technology  particularly in light of patents owned by others in the same field of use 
as of december   management of the company believed that no revision of the remaining useful lives or write down of the company s acquired technology was required in and no such revision was needed in and valuation of stock based compensation the company accounts for its stock option plans see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  under which no compensation cost has been recognized for options issued to employees at fair market value on the date of grant 
in  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
established a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation plans 
sfas no 
requires that a company s financial statements include certain disclosures about stock based employee compensation arrangement regardless of the method used to account for the plan 
the company accounts for its stock option and warrant grants to non employees in exchange for goods or services in accordance with sfas no 
and emerging issues task force no 
eitf 
sfas and eitf require that the company account for its option and warrant grants to non employees based on the fair value of the options and warrants granted 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the options granted 
in order to calculate the fair value of the options  assumptions are made for certain components of the model  including risk free interest rate  volatility  expected dividend yield rate and expected option life 
although  the company uses available resources and information when setting these assumptions  changes to the assumptions  could cause significant adjustments to the valuation 
contractual obligations as of december   the company had the following contractual commitments payments due by period less than contractual obligations total year years years more than years long term debt operating lease obligations    capital lease obligations    purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap other obligations sponsored research obligation     minimum royalty obligation      year total      year under the amended license agreement with princeton university and usc  the company is obligated to pay princeton university minimum royalties of  per year until such time the agreement is no longer in effect 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   the company had no off balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts  retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities or similar arrangements serving as credit  liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets  or obligations including contingent obligations arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to  or that engage in leasing  hedging or research and development services with  the company 
recently issued accounting pronouncements the company does not expect that the adoption of any recently issued accounting pronouncements would have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
for further discussion  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition the following factors  as well as other factors affecting the company s operating results and financial condition  could cause the company s actual future results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected 
the company does not expect to be profitable in the foreseeable future  and may never be profitable 
since inception  the company has generated limited revenues while incurring significant losses 
the company expects to incur losses for the foreseeable future and until such time  if ever  as the company is able to achieve sufficient levels of revenue from the commercial exploitation of its oled technologies to support its operations 
you should note  however  that o oled technology may never become commercially viable  o markets for flat panel displays utilizing oled technology may be limited  and o the company may never generate sufficient revenues from the commercial exploitation of its oled technologies to become profitable 
additionally  even if the company finds commercially viable applications for its oled technologies  the company may never recover its research and development costs 
if the company does not receive additional financing in the future  it might not be able to continue the research  development and commercialization of its oled technologies 
the company s capital requirements have been and will continue to be significant 
the completion of the research  development and commercialization of oled technologies for potential applications will require significant additional effort and resources 
the company s cash on hand may not be sufficient to meet all of its future obligations 
when the company needs additional funds  such funds may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if the company cannot obtain more money when needed  its business might fail 
additionally  if the company attempts to raise money in an offering of shares of its common stock  or if the company engages in acquisitions involving the issuance of additional shares of its common stock  the issuance of these shares will dilute the company s then existing shareholders 
if its oled technologies are not feasible for broad based product applications  the company may never generate revenues sufficient to support ongoing operations 
before oled manufacturers will agree to utilize the company s oled technologies for wide scale commercial production  it is likely that the company must first demonstrate to the satisfaction of these manufacturers that the company s oled technologies are feasible for broad based product applications 
this  in turn  will require substantial advances in the company s research and development efforts in a number of areas  including o device reliability  o the development of long lived oled materials for full color oled displays  and o issues related to scalability and cost effective fabrication technologies for product applications 
the company s efforts may never demonstrate the feasibility of its oled technologies for broad based product applications  particularly full color  large area  high resolution and high information content flat panel displays such as those used in televisions 
the company s research and development efforts remain subject to all of the risks associated with the development of new products based on emerging and innovative technologies  including  without limitation  unanticipated technical or other problems and the possible insufficiency of the funds allocated to complete development of these products 
technical problems may result in delays and cause the company to incur additional expenses that would increase its losses 
if the company cannot complete research and development of its oled technologies successfully  or if the company experiences delays in completing research and development of its oled technologies for use in potential applications  particularly after the occurrence of significant expenditures  the company s business may fail 
even if the company s oled technologies are technically feasible  they may not be adopted by manufacturers of oleds and oled containing products 
the potential size  timing and viability of market opportunities targeted by the company are uncertain at this time 
market acceptance of the company s oled technologies will depend  in part  upon these technologies providing benefits comparable to crt and lcd technologies the current standard display technologies at an appropriate cost  and the adoption of these technologies by consumers  neither of which have been achieved 
also  there may be a number of additional technologies that oled manufacturers need to utilize in order to bring oled containing products to the market 
many potential licensees of the company s oled technologies manufacture flat panel displays utilizing competing technologies  and may  therefore  be reluctant to redesign their products or manufacturing processes to incorporate the company s oled technologies 
moreover  even if the company s oled technologies are a viable alternative to competing technologies  if additional technologies are required to bring oled containing products to the market and potential licensees are unable to obtain access to these technologies  they may not utilize the company s oled technologies 
if the company s research partners fail to make advances in their research  or if they terminate their relationships with the company  the company might not succeed in commercializing its oled technologies 
research and development of commercially viable applications for the company s oled technologies depend substantially on the success of the sponsored research conducted by the company s research partners 
the company cannot be certain that its research partners will make additional advances in the research and development of oled technology 
moreover  although the company funds oled technology research  the scope of and technical aspects of this research and the resources and efforts directed to this research are in large part subject to the control of the company s research partners 
the company s most significant research and development relationships are with princeton university and usc 
the company s research agreement with princeton university expires in july and both this agreement and the amended license agreement with princeton university and usc can be terminated for various reasons 
for example  the research agreement provides that if dr 
forrest is unavailable to continue to serve as the principal investigator  because he is no longer associated with princeton university or for any other reason  and a successor acceptable to both the company and princeton university is not available  princeton university has the right to terminate the research agreement without impacting the amended license agreement 
the termination of the research agreement or the amended license agreement would materially and adversely affect the company s ability to research  develop and commercialize its oled technologies 
if the company cannot form strategic relationships with companies that manufacture oleds and oled containing products  its commercialization strategy will fail 
the company s strategic plan depends upon the development of strategic licensing relationships with high volume manufacturers of oleds and oled containing products 
the company has entered into only one such strategic licensing relationship with dupont displays 
all of the company s other relationships with manufacturers of oleds and oled containing products are currently limited to research  development and pre commercial evaluation and qualification of the company s oled technologies and materials 
the company s ability to enter into additional strategic licensing and sublicensing relationships may require it to make financial or other commitments 
the company might not be able  for financial or other reasons  to enter into these relationships on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s prospects also will be significantly affected by its ability to sell its proprietary oled materials to manufacturers of oleds 
the company s current supply agreement with ppg provides the company with a source for these oled materials and with exclusive rights to sell them to oled manufacturers  but this agreement expires at the end of the company s inability to continue obtaining these oled materials from ppg or another source would have a material adverse effect on the company 
if the company cannot protect its intellectual property rights  or if the company s oled technologies are found to infringe the rights of others  the company s business will suffer 
the value of the company s oled technologies is dependent on the company s ability to secure and maintain appropriate patent and other intellectual property rights protection 
although the company owns or licenses many oled technology patents that have already issued  there can be no assurance that additional patents applied for will be obtained  or that any of these patents  once issued  will afford commercially significant protection for the company s oled technologies  or will be found valid if challenged 
moreover  the company has not obtained patent protection for some of its oled technologies in all foreign countries in which oleds might be manufactured or sold 
in any event  the patent laws of other countries may differ from those of the united states as to the patentability of oled technology and the degree of protection afforded 
other companies and institutions may independently develop oled technologies that are equivalent or superior to those of the company  and may obtain patent or similar rights with respect to these technologies 
there are a number of other companies and organizations that have been issued patents and are filing additional patent applications relating to oled technology  including kodak  which holds a number of patents related to oled technology 
there can be no assurance that the exercise of some aspects of the patent rights respecting the company s oled technologies  including that being developed by princeton university and usc or licensed from motorola  will not infringe on the patents of others 
in this event  the company or its partners may be required to obtain licenses  pay damages  modify their products or methods of operation  or be prohibited from making  using  selling or offering to sell some or all oleds and oled containing products 
the company also might not have the financial or other resources necessary to enforce or defend a patent infringement action  and the licensors of the company s licensed patents might not enforce such an action in a timely manner 
if products incorporating the company s oled technologies are found to infringe upon the patent or other intellectual property rights of others  it could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the us government has rights to the company s oled technologies that might prevent the company from realizing the benefits of these technologies 
the us government  through various government agencies  has provided and continues to provide funding to the company  princeton university and usc for research activities related to certain aspects of the company s oled technologies 
based on its having provided this funding  the government has rights to these oled technologies that could restrict the company s ability to market them to the government for military and other applications  or to third parties for commercial applications 
moreover  if the government determines that the company has not taken effective steps to achieve practical application of these oled technologies in any field of use in a reasonable time  the government may require the company to grant licenses to other parties in this field of use 
any of these occurrences would limit the company s ability to obtain the full benefits of its oled technologies 
because many of the company s competitors have better name recognition and greater financial  technical  marketing and research capabilities  the company may never be able to compete successfully in the flat panel display industry 
the flat panel display industry is characterized by intense competition 
the market is currently  and will likely continue to be for some time  dominated by products utilizing lcd technology 
numerous companies are making substantial investments in  and conducting research to improve characteristics of  lcd technology 
several other flat panel display technologies have been  or are being  developed  including technologies for the production of field emission  inorganic electroluminescence  gas plasma and vacuum fluorescent displays 
in addition  other companies are engaged in research and development activities with respect to technology using oleds 
advances in lcd technology or any of these developing technologies may overcome their current limitations and permit them to become the leading technologies for flat panel displays  either of which could limit the potential market for flat panel displays utilizing the company s oled technologies 
substantially all of the company s competitors have better name recognition and greater financial  technical  marketing  personnel and research capabilities than the company 
the company s competitors may succeed in developing technologies and applications that are more cost effective or have fewer display limitations than the company s oled technologies 
in addition  the company may never be able to compete successfully or develop commercial applications for its oled technologies 
if the company cannot keep its key employees or hire other talented persons as it grows  the company s business might not succeed 
the company s performance is substantially dependent on the continued services of senior management and other key personnel  and its ability to offer competitive salaries and benefits to its employees 
the company does not have employment agreements with any of its management or key personnel 
additionally  competition for highly skilled technical  managerial and other personnel is intense 
the company might not be able to attract  hire  train  retain and motivate the highly skilled managers and employees it needs to be successful 
if the company fails to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel  it will suffer and might fail 
the company can issue shares of preferred stock that can adversely affect the rights of shareholders of its common stock 
the company s articles of incorporation authorize it to issue up to  shares of preferred stock with designations  rights and preferences determined from time to time by the company s board of directors 
accordingly  the board of directors is empowered  without shareholder approval  to issue preferred stock with dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights superior to those of shareholders of its common stock 
for example  an issuance of shares of preferred stock could o adversely affect the voting power of the shareholders of common stock  o make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of the company  o discourage bids for the company s common stock at a premium  or o otherwise adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
the company s board of directors has designated and issued two series of preferred stock that are currently outstanding a  shares of series a nonconvertible preferred stock  all of which are held by an entity controlled by sherwin seligsohn  and b  shares of series b convertible preferred stock that is held by motorola 
the series b convertible preferred stock is convertible into shares of common stock in accordance with the company s articles of incorporation 
as of december    shares of this series b convertible preferred stock are convertible into common stock and  shares of common stock would be issuable upon the conversion of these shares 
the company may issue additional shares of authorized preferred stock at any time in the future 
the market price of the company s common stock might be highly volatile 
the market price of the company s common stock might be highly volatile  as has been the case with the securities of many other companies  particularly other small and emerging growth companies 
factors such as the following may have a significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock o the company s expenses and operating results  o announcements by the company or its competitors of technological developments  new product applications or license arrangements  and o other factors affecting the flat panel display and related industries in general 
the issuance of other publicly traded shares of the company s common stock could drive the stock price down 
the price of the company s common stock can be expected to decrease if o other shares of the company s common stock that are currently subject to restriction on sale become freely salable  whether through an effective registration statement or under rule of the securities act of  or o the company issues additional shares of common stock that might be or become freely salable  including shares that would be issued upon conversion of its series b convertible preferred stock 
if the price of the company s common stock goes down  the company may have to issue more shares than are presently anticipated to be issued under the terms of its development and license agreement with ppg 
under the development and license agreement between the company and ppg  the company is required to issue to ppg shares of the company s common stock for services rendered by ppg 
if  at the time of issuance  the price of the company s common stock has declined materially since the date of the development and license agreement  the company may be required to issue to ppg more shares of the company s common stock than were initially anticipated 
this increase in the number of shares available for public sale could cause people to sell the company s common stock  including in short sales  which could drive the price of the common stock down  thus reducing its value and perhaps hindering the company s ability to raise additional funds in the future 
in addition  such an increase in the number of outstanding shares of the company s common stock would further dilute existing holders of this stock 
the company s executive officers and directors own a large percentage of the company s common stock and could exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval  including takeover attempts 
the company s executive officers and directors  and their respective affiliates  beneficially own as of december   approximately of the outstanding shares of the company s common stock 
moreover  pine ridge financial inc and strong river investments  inc assigned to management of the company their rights to vote the shares of common stock issued to them upon conversion of the convertible preferred stock  notes and warrants issued to them in an august private placement transaction 
accordingly  these shareholders and members of management may  as a practical matter  be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring approval by the company s shareholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combinations 
this concentration could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company 
the company s past use of arthur andersen as its independent auditor limits the ability of shareholders to seek potential recoveries from them related to their work 
on july   the company announced that it had appointed kpmg to replace arthur andersen as the company s independent public auditor 
the company s consolidated financial statements as of and for each of the years ended december  through have been audited by arthur andersen  as stated in its report dated march   which report is incorporated herein 
after reasonable efforts  the company has been unable to obtain arthur andersen s consent to the incorporation by reference into this document of its report with respect to the company s financial statements 
under these circumstances  rule a under the securities act of permits the company to file this document without a written consent from arthur andersen 
the absence of this consent may limit recovery by investors in the company s common stock on certain claims 
in particular  and without limitation  investors will not be able to assert claims against arthur andersen under section of the securities act of in addition  the ability of arthur andersen to satisfy any claims including claims arising from arthur andersen s provision of auditing and other services to the company will be limited as a practical matter due to recent events regarding arthur andersen 
this means that if an investor in the company s common stock were to assert a claim under section of the securities act relating to the purchase of this stock  that investor would not be able to seek damages from arthur andersen 
thus  as compared to a hypothetical investor in stock of a company whose inclusion of financial statements in its annual report was consented to by that company s independent auditor  an investor in the company s common stock would have fewer alternatives in seeking damages relating to the investor s purchase of such stock
