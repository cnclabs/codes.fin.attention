application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which are known as gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions were made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
our accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to a full understanding and evaluation of our reported financial results include those relating to revenue  allowances for doubtful accounts  legal contingencies  and accounting for income taxes 

table of contents each of these critical accounting policies is described in more detail below 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee 
see the notes to our consolidated financial statements  which contain additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
revenue we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
if we have doubt about the collectibility of revenue at the time it is earned  such revenue is deferred until cash has been received 
our revenue streams are derived from different sources in our two business divisions  web properties and jeeves solutions  as described below 
web properties revenues associated with our web properties division are generated from four general sources sales of branded advertising products  sales of premier listings and other paid placement products  sales of paid inclusion products  and syndication of services offered on our web sites to other companies sites 
our branded advertising ranges from traditional advertising units such as banners  towers and interstitials to dynamic animated placements through our branded animation service and highly targeted graphic units through our branded response service 
branded advertising is generally sold on a cost per impression basis with the revenue derived from such arrangements recognized during the period that the service is provided  provided that no significant obligations remain at the end of the period 
such obligations typically include the guarantee of a minimum number of impressions or times that an advertisement appears in pages viewed by users of our online properties 
to the extent the minimum guaranteed impressions are not delivered  we defer recognition of the corresponding revenue until the remaining guaranteed impressions levels are achieved 
our premier listings and other paid placement products are text messages that are designed to simply connect users interested in a particular product or service with an advertiser offering that product or service at the exact moment they need the information  much like a yellow pages listing 
with these products  advertisers pay only for performance  thus these revenues are generated when a user clicks on the answer that links to a merchant s web site on a cost per click  or cpc basis 
alternatively  we may recognize revenue on a revenue sharing basis when the paid placement service is offered through one of our third party providers 
our syndication services range from the sale of promotional material on behalf of partners to the syndication of our web wide search technology to portals  infomediaries  and content and destination web sites 
syndication license fees primarily consist of revenue sharing arrangements  fixed fee arrangements or fee per use arrangements  and revenues are recognized as the service is delivered 
revenues from revenue sharing arrangements are recorded net of amounts paid to syndication partners  except when we act as the primary obligor in the arrangement and bear risk with respect to the inventory of promotional space and credit risk  in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 which expense is recognized as a cost of sale and revenue is recorded on a gross basis 
our paid inclusion products provide an opportunity for web sites to ensure that they are included in our search index 
paid inclusion products are generally priced on a per url basis to have the url included in our database and periodically refreshed over a set period of time  which is typically one year 
revenues are collected in advance and recognized over the appropriate service period 

table of contents jeeves solutions revenues from our jeeves solutions division are derived from two sources software license revenues and services revenue 
software license revenues are generated from companies licensing the rights to use our natural language and customer intelligence technologies for use on their corporate web sites 
services revenue is generated from sales of maintenance agreements  consulting services and training services associated with our licensed software 
we recognize software license revenues in accordance with aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition or sop  as amended by statement of position sop provides specific industry guidance and stipulates that revenue recognized from software arrangements is to be allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the relative fair value of the elements 
under sop  the determination of fair value is based on the objective evidence that is specific to the vendor 
we utilize the residual method under which revenue is allocated to the undelivered element  based on vendor specific evidence of fair value and the residual amounts of revenue are allocated to the delivered element 
we recognize license revenues at the end of the core implementation period if implementation services are included in the original license arrangement and are considered to be essential to the functionality of the software 
as a result  even where we have a signed license agreement for the purchase of our software and have delivered the software  license revenue recognition depends on whether we have begun core implementation 
for license agreements under which we have no implementation responsibility  or where implementation is not considered to be essential to the functionality of the software  we recognize revenue upon delivery of the software 
examples of situations under which we have no implementation responsibility include additional license sales to existing customers or customers who elect to use internal or third party resources to implement the software 
in software license arrangements where a service element is critical to the functionality of the software  license  implementation and service fees are recognized ratably over the life of the arrangement  commencing upon service implementation 
license payments from our joint venture are recorded as deferred revenue and are being recognized as revenues on a straight line basis over a four year period 
we generally provide consulting and training services on a time and materials basis 
we provide maintenance and support services under renewable  term maintenance agreements  which we price as a percentage of our license fees 
maintenance and support fee revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual term  which is generally twelve months and commences from the implementation of service or delivery of product 
amounts paid prior to service implementation are recorded as deferred revenue  with recognition commencing upon service implementation 
allowances for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices 
for those invoices not specifically reviewed  provisions are provided at differing rates  based upon the age of the receivable 
in determining these percentages  we analyze our historical collection experience and current economic trends 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and our future results of operations could be harmed 
we also record a provision for returns and revenue adjustments in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future uncollectible revenue  then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could decrease 
legal contingencies we are involved currently in various claims and legal proceedings 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our material legal proceedings 

table of contents income tax as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million available to reduce future federal and state taxable income 
these net operating loss carryforwards are carried on our balance sheet as a deferred tax asset  but due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of realizing the benefits of our deferred tax assets from our net operating loss carryforwards in future years  we have recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
financial accounting statement standard no 
 accounting for income taxes or sfas requires that a valuation allowance be set up to reduce a deferred tax asset to the extent it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized 
in order for a company to realize the tax benefits associated with a net operating loss  it must have taxable income within the applicable carryback or carryfoward periods 
sources of taxable income that may allow for the realization of those tax benefits include taxable income in the current year or prior years that is available though a carryback claim  future taxable income that will result from the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  ie the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  and future taxable income generated by future operations 
sfas indicates that all available evidence  both positive and negative  should be identified and considered in making a determination as to whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
examples of positive evidence include strong earnings history  existing contracts or backlog  and assets with net built in gains for tax purposes 
examples of negative evidence include but are not limited to the following a pretax loss for financial reporting purposes for the current year or a recent preceding year  a deficit in stockholders equity  a history of operating loss or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused  and cumulative losses in recent years 
we believe that our losses in recent years and deficit in stockholder s equity present negative evidence that required a valuation allowance to be recorded to reduce to zero the deferred tax asset associated with the net operating losses 
accordingly  we have not taken a benefit for that asset 
if we generate taxable income in  this would be positive evidence that could allow us to release a portion of the valuation allowance set up against the asset 
however  since we still have losses in recent years and because there is no other compelling positive evidence  we believe that it would not be appropriate for us to release any more of the valuation than can be utilized in results of operations revenues year ended dollars in thousands change change web properties revenue percentage of total revenues jeeves solutions revenue percentage of total revenues total revenue our revenues are derived from our two business divisions 
web properties revenues are related to our internet search services and to the syndication of web search services to third party web sites 
jeeves solutions revenues are related to the sales of our software and service products to corporations 
total revenues for grew as compared with 
table of contents web properties revenue total web properties revenue increased over our revenues from this division consist of three main categories sales of paid placement products  branded advertising  and paid inclusion 
the following table presents sales for each product line  split between the us and the uk year ended dollars in thousands change change paid placement us uk total paid placement branded advertising us uk total branded advertising paid inclusion us uk total paid inclusion total web properties total us uk total web properties throughout  we made significant investments in technology  new products and in our web sites  with the overall goals of improving relevance of our search answers and user satisfaction 
we believe that these investments resulted in the significant growth in revenues in the us and  combined with our acquisition of our former joint venture in the uk  to overall revenue growth 
paid placement revenues increased in significantly from those in as we had improvement in both unit volumes and unit pricing 
additionally  we benefited from higher revenue sharing terms from one of our paid placement partners 
paid placement revenues also increased from the introduction of our premier listings product  which was launched in the first quarter of total advertising revenues grew for from those in due to the acquisition of our uk joint venture 
uk revenue decreased slightly in as the market demand for traditional online advertising products remained soft 
additionally  as part of our efforts to improve the user experience  we removed interstitial advertising and all banner advertising on ask 
com during the fourth quarter of  which negatively impacted revenues 
however our branded response product experienced strong growth  with its revenues increasing as compared to those in our paid inclusion product  which was launched in the first quarter of  contributed approximately one percent of our revenues 
this product showed strong growth on a percentage basis every quarter during the year  from a small base 
we believe revenues from this product will ramp more slowly due to the nature of this product s revenue model  with fees recognized gradually over the service periods  which typically run one year 
during  web properties revenues were impacted by softer demand for online advertising  most significantly with respect to banner advertising  resulting in a decrease in rates paid 
the decrease was partially offset by revenue from new advertising products  such as branded animation and interstitials  which were introduced during the year 
for  we expect the continued revenue growth we experienced in we intend to seek revenue growth by increasing traffic to our web sites  increasing the percentage of our traffic that produces revenue for us and  by increasing the price we charge for our products and services 
we intend to seek increased web traffic by improving the relevance of our search answers and  thereby  increasing user satisfaction 
during the fourth quarter of  we launched teoma  which is the second generation of our search technology 
this version doubled the size of our search index and added spell check functionality as well as some advanced search tools 
we plan to continue our investments in technology  by doubling the size of the search index again during and adding more features and functionality 
further  we plan to increase our marketing efforts to new users  which during consisted of relatively few and minor initiatives 
we believe that these steps  combined with improvements to the user experience  will lead to growth in traffic of our web sites 

table of contents jeeves solutions revenue total jeeves solutions revenue decreased as compared with revenues from this division consist of license and services revenue 
the following table presents sales from each category and to corporate customers and our joint venture partners 
year ended dollars in thousands change change licenses corporate japan uk and spanish language total licenses services corporate japan uk and spanish language total services total jeeves solutions total corporate japan uk and spanish language total jeeves solutions license revenues decreased significantly in as compared with this was due to the termination of license arrangements with our spanish language joint venture  ask jeeves en espanol  in late and with our uk joint venture  which we acquired in early additionally  licensing to corporate customers decreased in from in  corporate licenses were adversely affected by the reductions in spending across the market for information technology 
services revenues were lower in compared to  almost entirely due to reductions in spending from corporate customers 
services to corporate customers decreased by approximately the same amount as licensing  as demand for services were similarly impacted by the decrease in information technology spending 
in  license revenues increased compared to those in  due to the recognition of deferred revenue associated with international licensing arrangements with our joint ventures  which was partially offset by decreases in new customer bookings for domestic corporate licenses 
service revenue in compared to was reduced because of the decrease in new customer bookings during the year 
a significant portion of service revenues result from the provision of consulting and training services 
such services frequently are associated with new customer bookings 
when customers renew subscription based contracts  such renewals may not result in additional consulting service revenue 
we expect the market for corporate information technology to continue to be soft for the foreseeable future 
for  we plan to continue to develop jeeves services product offerings to meet the needs of our customers  so that we will be well positioned when corporate spending on technology recovers 

table of contents gross margin year ended dollars in thousands change change web properties gross profit web properties gross margin jeeves solutions gross profit jeeves solutions gross margin total gross profit total gross margin web properties gross margin cost of revenues for our web properties division consists primarily of costs related to traffic acquisition and the delivery of our search results

this decrease in cost of revenues was more than offset by the decrease in web properties revenue 
jeeves solutions gross margin cost of revenues for our jeeves solutions division consists primarily of salaries and related personnel costs and other direct costs of providing consulting and licensing to our corporate customers 
cost of revenues for jeeves solutions also includes amortization charges related to technology acquired in certain of our business combinations 
gross margin for jeeves solutions decreased in due entirely to the decrease in jeeves solutions revenue  primarily related to the terminated license arrangements with ask jeeves en espanol and our uk joint venture  which had high margin characteristics 
on a dollar basis  cost of revenues decreased million to million in as compared with the decrease is reflective of significant decreases in salary and related costs resulting from the decrease in revenue levels and to the reduced personnel needs due to our migration to the jeevesone software platform  which is less labor intensive than our hosted product 
the increase in jeeves solutions gross margin in over reflects significant decreases in compensation and compensation related costs and facilities charges relating to our restructuring activities during the year 
this decrease in costs more than offset the decrease in jeeves solutions revenue during the period 
operating expenses year ended dollars in thousands change change product development percentage of total revenues sales and marketing percentage of total revenues general and administrative percentage of total revenues stock based compensation percentage of total revenues amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets percentage of total revenues 
table of contents product development expenses product development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  consultant fees and expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our technology and services 
to date  all software development costs have been expensed as incurred 
decreased compensation and compensation related costs and the use of consultants comprise the majority of the dollar decrease in over  and resulted from our focus on key  strategic areas of product development to support our business plan and reduction in the number of product development initiatives that are not essential to delivering future financial results 
further  we reached several significant product release milestones in the jeeves solutions division  including the release of jeevesone in late and the extension of jeevesone to additional platforms in  which decreased our need for consultants and other product development expenses 
the decrease in product development expenses from to reflects the benefit of our restructuring activities during  including decreased compensation and compensation related costs

sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related personnel expenses as well as advertising and promotional expenditures 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in both and reflects cost cutting measures in variable spending areas including advertising  promotional programs and public relations  which was partially offset in by slightly higher sales commissions reflecting the increased revenues 
during  we replaced mass market promotion with targeted marketing initiatives  resulting in a decrease in the total amount of sales and marketing spending compared to we anticipate that spending on marketing initiatives will increase slightly in as compared with during  we launched relatively few marketing initiatives as we focused on cost cutting efforts

table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist of costs for general corporate functions including depreciation and other facilities charges  and insurance 
further  the provision for doubtful accounts  various accounting  investor relations and legal costs associated with operating our business as well as administrative function salaries  are also included 
expenses were lower primarily due to decreased salary and incentive compensation charges  decreased use of outside consultants and decreased charges for doubtful accounts receivable  partially offset by increased costs for insurance and legal expenses 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in over is the result of significant cost cutting measures in the area of travel and entertainment and other discretionary spending  as well as decreased compensation 
stock based compensation stock based compensation reflects the amortization of stock compensation charges from certain employee stock options 
deferred compensation charges arise from the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of specific stock options granted to our employees and is amortized over the vesting period 
we recorded  in amortization of deferred stock based compensation in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and consultants for the year ended december    for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the decrease in amortization is due to our graded vesting method of amortization resulting in larger deferred compensation charges being incurred in earlier periods 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets we have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of various purchase acquisitions we have completed 
prior to the adoption of sfas on january   goodwill and intangible assets were amortized ratably over the estimated economic lives of the respective assets  which is generally three to five years 
subsequent to the adoption of sfas  we review long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
we assess these assets for impairment based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows from these assets 
if the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows  a loss is recorded for the excess of the asset s carrying value over the fair value 
we recorded no amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets in operating expense for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  during  we recorded an impairment loss of million on goodwill and other intangible assets relating to certain of our acquisitions 
this impairment loss reduced our recorded basis in goodwill and other intangible assets and had the effect of reducing amortization expense during and eliminating the expense in dollars in thousands change change write off of in process technology impairment of long lived assets restructuring costs in process technology for the year ended december   we wrote off in process technology of million in connection with the acquisition of certain technology from evergreen project  inc and direct hit technologies  inc

during the first quarter of  we identified indicators of possible impairment of our long lived assets  consisting principally of acquired intangible assets and goodwill 
with the assistance of independent valuation experts  we performed asset impairment tests at the enterprise level  the lowest level for which there were identifiable cash flows related to our acquired intangible assets and goodwill 
the tests were performed by comparing the expected undiscounted cash flows for a four year period  plus a terminal value for future cash flows  to the carrying amount of the long lived assets resulting from purchase business combinations 
based on the results of these tests  we determined that long lived assets initially recorded in connection with our business combinations were impaired 
we measured the impairment loss related to long lived assets based on the amount by which the carrying amount of such assets exceeded its fair value 
measurement of fair value was based on an analysis by us  with assistance from independent valuation experts  of the future discounted cash flows at the enterprise level 
the analysis indicated that our long lived assets were impaired by an amount totaling million 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment write down  allocated to goodwill  of this amount during the first quarter of during the third quarter of  we identified additional indicators of possible impairment of our long lived assets  consisting principally of acquired intangible assets and goodwill 
we performed asset impairment tests using similar methodologies as those employed in the first quarter 
based on the results of these tests  we determined that the carrying value of long lived assets recorded in connection with our business combinations were impaired 
we measured the impairment loss related to long lived assets based on the amount by which the carrying amount of such assets exceeded its fair value  using similar methodologies as employed in the first quarter of the analysis indicated that our long lived assets were impaired by an amount totaling million 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment write down  allocated to acquired intangible assets and goodwill  of this amount during the three month period ended september  we did not record any write downs of long lived assets during the year ended december  restructuring costs in response to new challenges in the business environment  in december  our board of directors approved a restructuring program aimed at streamlining our underlying cost structure to better position us for growth and improved operating results 
as part of the restructuring program  we implemented a reduction in force of approximately positions 
the reductions came from all areas of our company and  as of december   all of the affected employees had been notified and the majority of these terminations were completed 
as part of the restructuring  we determined that the operations of the evergreen project  inc  which was acquired in january  no longer fit our strategic objectives and were terminated 
we incurred a charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of the year ended december  relating to the restructuring 
this charge included million related to costs associated with employee terminations  which included severance pay and medical and other benefits plus legal and accounting costs 
the charge also included approximately million in estimated facility exit costs and million in non cash asset write downs 
the facility exit costs were associated with the consolidations of various facilities in california and missouri 
non cash asset write downs related to the termination of the evergreen operation were approximately million of goodwill and  of equipment 
in the year ended december   we reported charges of approximately million  which included approximately million related to facility consolidations in california  as a result of unsuccessful attempts to sublease in a rapidly deteriorating market which led to our decision to terminate a significant lease obligation for a termination fee 
in addition  the charge included additional severance pay and medical and other benefits of 
table of contents approximately million  costs relating to termination of marketing agreements totaling approximately million and an asset write off related to the termination of the evergreen operation of approximately  as of december   all of the affected employees had been notified and the majority of the terminations were completed 
in the year ended december   we incurred additional restructuring charges of approximately million relating to workforce reductions and facilities exit costs 
during the second and third quarters  we implemented workforce reductions totaling approximately positions and resulting in charges of million for severance pay and medical and other benefits 
as of december   all of the affected employees had been notified and the majority of the terminations were completed 
additionally  in the fourth quarter  we revised our assumptions relating to our ability to sublease vacated facilities  resulting in facilities exit charges totaling million 
while we believe that our business realignment will assist us in streamlining operations  reducing expenses and thereby achieving profitability  we may in the future be required to take additional actions  including further changes to the business organization  to realign the business with anticipated requirements 
if we are not successful in realigning our business to increase revenues and decrease costs  we may not remain profitable or cash flow positive 
gain on dissolution of joint venture in october  we dissolved ask jeeves en espanol  our spanish language joint venture with univision communications  inc in connection with the dissolution  we received cash of approximately million and reacquired the rights and licenses originally assigned to the venture 
we recorded a gain of million in the fourth quarter of  representing the remaining balance of deferred revenue paid to us by the venture as well as the value of cash received by us 
interest and other income  net dollars in thousands change change interest and other income  net interest income was million  for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  interest income relates primarily to interest earned on fixed income securities and correlates with the average balance of those investments and prevailing interest rates 
the decrease in interest income in over  as well as the decrease in over  relates to decreases in both average balances and prevailing interest rates during the year 
interest expense was  for the year ended december    for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense is attributable to decreases in the amounts due under capital leases 
the increase in interest expense from to is attributable to the interest charges incurred on borrowings under our line of credit and on capital lease obligations 
further  during the year ended december   we recorded a gain of  representing the remaining balance of deferred license fees paid to us by ask jeeves uk  for a licensing arrangement that was terminated when we acquired the remaining outstanding equity interest of ask jeeves uk 
in february  we acquired the entire outstanding equity interests in ask jeeves uk 
the terms of the agreement include an obligation for us to pay to our former partners fifty percent of the net proceeds of any qualifying sale or offering of shares of ask jeeves uk through march as of december   we have recorded a deferred gain of million representing the fair value of assets acquired by us in excess of consideration paid 
the gain will be recognized as other income when the contingent payment obligation to our former partners expires in march seasonality and quarterly fluctuations in operating results our operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
factors that may adversely affect our results of operations include our ability to obtain new corporate customers  the length of the development cycle for corporate customers and the timing of revenue recognition with respect to contracts with corporate customers  our ability to obtain new advertising contracts  maintain existing ones  and effectively manage our advertising inventory  the number of questions asked and answered on our web sites and on the web sites of our corporate customers  our ability to attract and retain advertisers and our ability to link our partners to potential customers  rate changes for advertising on our web sites  
table of contents marketing expenses and technology infrastructure costs as well as other costs that we may incur as we expand our operations 
seasonal and other fluctuations in demand for our services and for advertising space on our web sites  our ability to develop and introduce new technology  announcements and new technology introductions by our competitors  our ability to attract and retain key personnel  and costs relating to possible acquisitions and integration of technologies or businesses 
because of the foregoing factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
as the internet advertising market continues to develop  seasonal and cyclical patterns may emerge  or become more pronounced  thereby causing period to period variability within each year s revenues 
for example  we have historically experienced stronger periods of growth in the second and fourth quarters of the year 
similar to the advertising revenue cycle experienced by traditional media companies  this apparent trend may result in our advertising sales being lower during the summer vacation period 
seasonality in the retail industry and in internet service usage is likely to cause quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations  which could harm our business

since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the private placement of equity securities  our initial public offering in june and our follow on public offering in march as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  and marketable securities  of which million was restricted 
marketable securities consist of highly liquid instruments primarily us  state and municipal government securities and corporate debt securities with short maturities 
of this amount  million was categorized as cash and cash equivalents at december   representing a decrease of million from december  we consider all cash and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of less than three months at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
the decrease resulted primarily from cash used in operations of million  which was partially offset by cash flows from investing activities of million and financing activities of million 
net cash used in operating activities increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase resulted primarily from net losses of million adjusted for non cash items of million  and decreases in working capital of million 
significant non cash items included depreciation and amortization charges of million 
the decrease in working capital resulted from payments of accrued restructuring costs of million and accounts payable of million in addition to decreases in deferred revenue of million 
net cash provided by investing activities increased by million to million in from million in cash from investing activities resulted primarily from the net redemption of marketable securities of million and cash acquired in business combinations of million  which was partially offset by capital expenditures of million for the purchase of fixed assets 

table of contents net cash provided by financing activities decreased by million to million in compared to million in cash from financing relates primarily to net issuances of common stock of million reduced by payments on capital lease obligations 
we have a revolving line of credit with a bank in the amount of million 
the line of credit expires on july   unless extended 
borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at libor plus at december  all borrowings are collateralized by an equal amount of our marketable securities 
the line of credit agreement contains various covenants 
as of december   borrowings of million were outstanding under the line of credit 
additionally  standby letters of credit of approximately  were issued and outstanding under the line of credit  which are being maintained as security for performance under lease obligations 
should we choose not to renew the line of credit  we do not believe our business would be harmed 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our services and the amount of resources we invest in web site and content development  marketing and selling our products and services  our brand promotions and any future acquisitions or divestitures 
we anticipate that our existing unrestricted cash and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
at the end of such period  we will need to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures  or we will need to raise additional capital 
however  if we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us  these failures could seriously harm our business 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   our only unconsolidated subsidiary is in ask jeeves japan  which generally provides ask jeeves services within a defined geographic region 
the company does not have majority voting rights or majority residual interests in the assets or income of any off balance sheet entities  including ask jeeves japan 
further  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide additional funding to any such entities 
accordingly  we are not materially exposed to any market  credit  liquidity or financing risk that could arise from engaging in such relationships 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
contractual obligations  contingent liabilities and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands total less than year years years thereafter borrowings under line of credit capital lease obligations non cancelable operating leases total amounts above include sublease rental income 
we have no material commitments or obligations other than those under leases and our line of credit 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations except for qualifying business combinations that were initiated prior to july  sfas further clarifies the criteria to recognize intangible assets separately from goodwill 
the requirements of sfas are effective for any business combination accounted for by the purchase method that is completed after september  under sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives but with no maximum life 
the amortization provisions of statement apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  sfas will have no affect on our financial statements 
had the provisions of sfas been in effect during the year ended december   our results would not have been materially impacted from those reported 
had the provisions of sfas been in effect during the year ended december   adjusted net loss would have been  and adjusted net loss per share would have been 
during august  the financial accounting standards board also issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and supercedes statements of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
relating to the disposal of a segment of business 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit and disposal activities 
this statement supercedes the accounting for exit and disposal activities under emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
commitment to a plan to exit an activity or dispose of long lived assets will no longer be sufficient to record a one time charge for most anticipated costs 
instead  sfas requires exit or disposal costs be recorded when they are incurred and can be measured at fair value 
sfas further requires that the recorded liability be adjusted for changes in estimated cash flows 
the provisions of sfas are effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  previously issued financial statements cannot be restated for the effect of the provisions of sfas and liabilities previously recorded under eitf issue no 
are grandfathered 
we do not believe sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
provided guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of eitf issue no 
will have on our results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format 
additionally  sfas no 
requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements 
the transition and annual disclosure requirements of sfas no 
are effective for our fiscal year the interim disclosure requirements are effective for the first quarter of our fiscal year we do not expect sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation consolidation of variable interest entities 
the interpretation defines variable interest entities as those in which equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities with out additional subordinated financial support from other parties  or entities in which equity investors lack certain essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected residual returns  or both  as a result of holding variable interests  which are the ownership  contractual  or other pecuniary interests in an entity 
the primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the financial position and results of operations of the variable interest entity 
the interpretation applies immediately to interests in variable interest entities acquired after january  and for the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  for interests previously acquired in such entities 
we believe that adoption of this statement will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents risk factors included below are other risk factors that may affect our future operating results 
risks related to our company we have a history of net losses and might not remain profitable 
we have incurred net losses every year since our inception 
although we were profitable in the fourth quarter of  as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we cannot assure you that we will remain profitable or cash flow positive 
moreover  we might not be able to increase our operating profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
to increase profits  we will need to generate revenue growth from our advertising and corporate customers while continuing to control our expenses 
beginning in late  we announced steps to control costs  including business realignment and a reduction in our workforce 
these measures reduced our operating costs during but might yet result in long term problems  such as delayed product development or reduced morale  which could be expensive and difficult to remedy 
moreover  we might be unable to reduce operating costs any further and we face the risk that our costs might increase again in the future 
indeed  we believe it is critical that we continue to expend financial and management resources to develop our brand loyalty through marketing and promotion  to enhance our search technologies and to expand our other services 
if we fail to increase revenues or control costs  our annual net losses would likely resume  in which case we would eventually need to obtain additional financing or cease operations 
we derive a significant amount of revenue from our paid placement arrangement with google inc we derive a significant amount of our revenues under an agreement with google inc  to participate in their sponsored links program through which we share revenues generated from google s advertisers on our search web sites 
we generated more than of our total revenue for from our participation 
the contract is scheduled to terminate in september  however if the contract were to end unexpectedly  we would need to find another suitable partner or otherwise replace the lost revenues 
further  if google s performance under this contract were to unexpectedly deteriorate or our ability to generate traffic for these listings were to decrease  our results of operations could be harmed 
web based business models are still evolving 
our advertising revenue will depend on our ability to achieve  measure and demonstrate to advertisers the breadth of web traffic using our search service and the value of our targeted advertising 
currently  there are a variety of pricing models for selling advertising on the internet  including models based on the number of impressions delivered  the number of click throughs by users  the duration over which the advertisement is displayed or the number of keywords to which the advertisement is linked 
it is still difficult to predict which pricing model  if any  will emerge as the industry standard 
this uncertainty makes it difficult to project our future advertising rates and revenues 
a decrease in advertising sold or further cuts in advertising rates would reduce our total revenue 
if our jeeves solutions division fails to obtain new sources of licensing revenue  its financial results will be weaker than for the year ended december   our jeeves solutions division generated million  or approximately of our total revenues  from licensing software and services 
included in that amount are intellectual property licensing revenues of approximately million that jeeves solutions received from ask jeeves uk and ask jeeves japan 
however  in february  we acquired full ownership of ask jeeves uk from our joint venture partner 
consequently  
table of contents its intellectual property license has terminated  which may cause a decrease in future licensing revenues of jeeves solutions 
if our jeeves solutions division cannot obtain new sources of licensing revenue from third parties in  its financial results will suffer 
we rely on third party advertising delivery that could affect our ability to deliver advertisements on our web sites 
we rely on third party advertising services  provided by doubleclick  inc to deliver advertisements to our users 
doubleclick is currently the only provider available in the market that meets our delivery needs 
if doubleclick fails to deliver advertisements as contracted for due to reliability or performance problems  or if advertisements cannot be targeted as promised to advertisers  our revenues may decrease 
if we cannot maintain the popularity of our search engine among internet users  our business plan will fail 
we will be successful only if a critical mass of internet users adopt our search technologies and services as a primary method of navigating the internet 
internet users have a variety of other search techniques  including other search engines and subject matter directories  available to them to find information on the web 
users can also use non web based methods of obtaining information through the internet  including call centers  chat rooms and e mail  rather than browsing through difficult to navigate corporate web sites 
our search technologies  including those of our recent acquisition of teoma technologies  inc  are novel and unproven 
it is difficult to predict the rate at which users will sample our services and the extent to which they will adopt them as their primary search technology 
even in the case of repeat users  it is difficult to know whether they return to our web sites because they are satisfied with our offerings or because they are dissatisfied with the alternatives 
at any time  users of our services might revert to prior search techniques or choose new search techniques altogether 
we cannot assure you that widespread acceptance of our search technologies and services will occur 
if we cannot maintain the popularity of our search engine among internet users  our business plan will fail 
if high quality  third party data ceases to be available  or directly accessible  on the web  our business plan might fail 
our internet search services are designed to directly link users to a page within a third party web site that contains an answer to the user s question 
we have little control over the content of these third party web sites 
if these third party web sites do not contain high quality  up to date information  the utility of our service to the user will be reduced 
in addition  when our search engine attempts to direct the user to a page within a third party company s web site  the company administering the site sometimes automatically redirects users to that company s own home page 
if third party companies prevent us from directly linking our users to pages within their web sites  and if there are no comparable alternative web sites to which we can direct our users  the utility and attractiveness of our services to users will be reduced 
if the utility of our services diminishes for either of the above reasons  traffic on our web sites will likely fall  which would reduce our ability to charge for advertising and premium listings 
if we fail to compete effectively against our current and potential competitors  we will lose market share 
we compete in markets that are new  intensely competitive  fragmented and rapidly changing 
many of our competitors are bringing new search technologies to market  establishing alliances with key portals and focusing on specific segments of the search market 
in particular web properties our web properties division faces direct competition from companies that provide internet search and directory services 
for example  web properties competes with search providers  including altavista company  fast alltheweb 
com  google  inc and yahoo inc 
inktomi  for the traffic generated by internet users seeking links to third party content to address their online information retrieval needs 
web properties also competes with directory services  including overture services  inc  looksmart  ltd 
and yahoo inc  because they provide alternative ways for users to obtain the desired information 
jeeves solutions our jeeves solutions division competes with a number of companies that provide customer self service solutions for corporate customers 
for example  jeeves solutions competes with companies providing advanced natural language solutions  including iphrase technologies  inc and 
table of contents kanisa inc  search technology companies  including google  inc 
and verity  inc  and catalog search companies  including easyask  inc 
and mercado software  inc our growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain new users through effective promotional campaigns 
we believe that favorable consumer and business community perceptions of the ask jeeves brands are essential to our future success 
accordingly  we intend to continue pursuing brand enhancement strategies  which may include mass market and multimedia advertising  promotional programs and public relations activities 
as with any public awareness campaign  we face the risk that our expenditures might not lead to the desired result  that is we might experience no net increase in our brand recognition or brand loyalty  our number of new users  our web site traffic or our number of corporate customers 
furthermore  even if such increases occur  they might not be sufficiently large to justify the expenditures 
if we are unable to promote brand awareness and loyalty in a cost effective manner  we are unlikely to attract new users and our existing user base might shrink through attrition 
if we are unable to rapidly and successfully develop new products and new product enhancements  as well as to integrate acquired technologies  we might be unable to meet customer demand 
in the highly competitive  rapidly changing internet search environment  our future success depends in large part on our ability to develop and introduce new products that meet the needs of our customers more rapidly than our competitors 
in our web properties division  for example  we are currently developing new enhancements to many of our advertising products  including branded response  premier listings  site submit and index express to meet new demands in the marketplace 
if we are unable to develop these and other new and enhanced products on a timely basis  we might lose market share to our faster competitors and never recoup our development costs 
product development is complicated by the following factors  among others it is difficult  expensive and time consuming to design alternate versions of a product to run on each of the operating system platforms that our customers might have in place 
additionally  we have acquired technology to accelerate our ability to meet new product requirements and enhancements 
for example  in september we acquired teoma technologies  inc and in january we announced the acquisition of certain technology from octopus software  inc we must continue to scale and integrate these technologies into our existing and new products 
if we are unable to successfully and rapidly integrate these and other technologies into our products  our business may be harmed 
our business may suffer in a variety of ways unless overall economic conditions improve 
current economic conditions pose a variety of additional challenges to our business 
the financial condition of many of our customers has deteriorated and continues to deteriorate because of their inability to raise additional funds for their businesses 
many of our customers are making and will continue to make significant cutbacks in their sales and marketing efforts and capital expenditures  which will in turn harm our financial results 
our inability to rapidly replace this portion of our customer base will negatively impact our business 
our past acquisitions and any future acquisitions may disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value  divert management attention or be difficult to integrate 
we have acquired a number of companies since our initial public offering  including teoma technologies  inc in september and ask jeeves uk in february we may in the future seek to acquire or invest in additional businesses  products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our business  augment our market coverage  enhance our technical capabilities or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
however  in doing so  we may encounter problems with the assimilation of acquired businesses  products or technologies including difficulties in assimilation of acquired personnel  operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs associated with acquisitions  
table of contents diversion of management s attention from other business concerns and potential disruption of our ongoing business  adverse effects on our existing business relationships with our customers  potential patent or trademark infringement from acquired technologies  adverse effects on our current employees and the inability to retain employees of acquired companies  use of substantial portions of our available cash as all or a portion of the purchase price  and dilution of our current stockholders due to issuances of additional securities as consideration for acquisitions 
if we are unable to successfully integrate our acquired companies or to create new or enhanced services  we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions 
if we fail to achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquisitions  we may incur increased expenses and experience a shortfall in our anticipated revenues and we may not obtain a satisfactory return on our investment 
in addition  if a significant number of employees of acquired companies fail to remain employed with us  we may experience difficulties in achieving the expected benefits of the acquisitions 
if we fail to maintain effective internal financial and managerial systems  controls and procedures  our results of operations may be harmed 
our recent business realignment and reductions in workforce placed a significant strain on our managerial staff  financial controls and operational resources as our employees have assumed greater responsibilities and learned to manage their increased workload with reduced resources 
we continue to evaluate our operational and financial systems and our managerial controls and procedures to determine what additional changes  if any  might help us to better manage our current operations 
we face the risk that our systems  procedures and controls might not be adequate to support our operations or to maintain accountability for our assets 
any such failure could harm our results of operations 
our international expansion efforts might lose money 
any expansion by us into international markets will require substantial management attention and financial resources 
establishing operations in other countries is a significant investment that might not produce the desired levels of revenue 
in addition  our foreign operations are subject to other inherent risks and problems  including the impact of business cycles and downturns in economies outside the united states  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  unanticipated tax costs associated with the cross border use of intangible assets  political and economic instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulty in maintaining effective communications with employees and customers due to distance  language and cultural barriers  lower brand recognition for ask jeeves and the jeeves character in non english speaking countries  
table of contents lower per capita internet usage in many foreign countries  for a variety of reasons including lower disposable incomes  lack of adequate telecommunications and computer infrastructure and concerns regarding online security for e commerce transactions  and competition in international markets from a broad range of competitors  including altavista company  google  inc  overture services  inc  looksmart  ltd  yahoo inc 
and other united states and foreign portals  search engines and service providers 
some or all of the above factors could seriously harm the results of our operations 
legal actions may be initiated against us seeking to hold us liable for our links to third party web sites 
our internet search services are designed to directly link users to a page within a third party web site that contains an answer to the user s question 
these direct links might expose us to legal actions seeking to hold us liable for the content of those third party web sites 
these actions might claim  for example  that we should be liable for copyright or trademark infringement or other unauthorized actions by the third party web site 
other claims may be based on errors or false or misleading information provided through our web sites  including information deemed to constitute professional advice including legal  medical  financial or investment advice 
other claims may be based on our links to sexually explicit web sites and our provision of sexually explicit advertisements when this content is displayed 
while no such claims are pending and we do not believe that any such claim would have legal merit  defending against such a legal action could be expensive and distract management 
implementing measures to reduce our exposure to such claims may require us to spend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our service to users 
risks related to operating in our industry the operating performance of our computer systems and web servers is critical to our business and reputation 
any system failure  including network  software or hardware failure due to a computer virus or otherwise  that causes an interruption in our service or a decrease in our responsiveness could result in reduced user traffic on our web sites and reduced revenues for our business 
we have network and server equipment located at metromedia fiber network in california and england  worldcom in massachusetts  and cable wireless communications in england 
although we believe that our current back up methods are adequate  we face the risk that our back up servers might fail or might cause an interruption in our service 
we have experienced slower response times and interruptions in service due to malfunction at our hosting facilities and on the internet backbone networks  major software upgrades on our web sites and undetected software defects 
our web sites have had partial interruptions for periods ranging from a few minutes to three hours 
in addition  our web sites also could be affected by computer viruses  electronic break ins or other similar disruptions 
if we experience outages  frequent or persistent system failures or degraded response times  user satisfaction would decrease  we would likely lose advertising revenues and our reputation and brands could be permanently harmed 
our users and customers depend on internet service providers  online service providers and other web site operators for access to our web sites 
each of these types of providers has experienced significant outages in the past and could experience outages  delays and other operating difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems 
the occurrence of an earthquake or other natural disaster or unanticipated problem at our principal facilities or at the servers that host or back up our systems could cause interruptions or delays in our interactive network or a loss of data 
our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure  break ins  earthquake and similar events 
we have not developed a comprehensive disaster recovery plan to respond to system failures 
our general liability insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur due to interruptions in our service 
our long term success depends upon the growth and acceptance of internet advertising as an effective alternative to traditional advertising media 
we compete with traditional media including television  radio and print  in addition to other high traffic web sites  for a share of advertisers total advertising expenditures 
we face the risk that advertisers might find internet advertising to be a less effective than traditional media at promoting their products or services and may further reduce or eliminate their 
table of contents expenditures on internet advertising 
many potential advertisers and advertising agencies have only limited experience advertising on the internet and have not devoted a significant portion of their advertising expenditures to internet advertising 
acceptance of the internet among advertisers will depend  to a large extent  on the perceived effectiveness of internet advertising and the continued growth of commercial usage of the internet 
filter software programs that limit or prevent advertising from being displayed on a user s computer are available 
it is unclear whether this type of software will become widely accepted  but if it does  it would negatively affect internet based advertising 
our business could be seriously harmed if the market for internet advertising does not continue to grow 
a breach of our computer security could damage our reputation and deter customers from using our services 
we attempt to protect our computer systems and network from physical break ins  security breaches and other disruptive problems caused by the internet or other users 
computer break ins could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network  which could reduce our ability to retain or attract customers  damage our reputation or subject us to litigation 
we could be subject to denial of service  vandalism and other attacks on our systems by internet hackers 
although we intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent break ins  damage and failures  these security measures might fail 
our insurance coverage in certain circumstances might be insufficient to cover issues that might result from such events 
if we do not adapt our search services for users of cell phones  pdas and similar devices  we might lose market share as users increasingly use handheld devices to access the internet 
in the coming years  the number of individuals who access the internet through devices other than a personal computer is expected to increase 
these alternative devices include personal digital assistants  known as pdas  cellular telephones and television set top devices 
the low resolution  functionality and memory currently associated with some of these alternative devices may prevent or impede their users from accessing our graphics rich web services 
unless we successfully launch a version of our web search service that is easily accessible through these alternative devices  we face a risk of losing market share if personal computer users migrate toward use of these alternative devices to access the internet 
our ability to remain profitable might depend on continued growth of internet use 
our revenue model depends in large part on the volume of internet user traffic to our web sites 
our business will be harmed if internet usage does not continue to grow or grows at significantly lower rates compared to current trends 
the continued growth of the internet is subject to various risks  many of which are outside our control 
these risks include the following the internet infrastructure might not be able to support the demands placed on it  performance and reliability of the internet might decline as usage grows and disruptions caused by malicious users or hackers increases  locating useful information online might become more difficult as the number of web sites proliferates  causing internet usage rates to decrease or to grow at a decreasing rate  users might hesitate to engage in online commerce because they feel insecure transmitting confidential information  such as credit card numbers  over the internet  and users privacy concerns might lead them to reduce internet use so as to prevent web sites from gathering user information without the user s knowledge or consent 
our reliance on internet companies leaves us vulnerable to credit risks 
we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales to internet companies 
many of these companies have limited operating histories and are operating at a loss 
moreover  many of these companies have limited cash reserves and limited access to additional capital 
we have in some cases experienced difficulties collecting outstanding accounts receivable from internet companies 
our collection difficulties might increase as economic 
table of contents recovery is delayed  particularly in light of the general unavailability of new public or private funding for companies in the internet sector 
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled technical employees 
our success depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
competition for employees in the san francisco bay area  where our headquarters is located  has in the past been intense 
this was due  in part  to the high concentration of high tech companies vying for qualified employees  high housing costs and traffic congestion 
we have experienced  and we expect to continue to experience in the future  difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications 
if we fail to attract  retain and motivate our employees  our business will be harmed 
in addition  hiring highly qualified customer service and account management personnel is very competitive in our industry due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of the internet 
if we are unable to hire and retain qualified sales personnel our business may suffer 
we may face potential liability  loss of users and damage to our reputation for violation of privacy policies 
we have a policy against using personally identifiable information obtained from users of our natural language question answering technologies without the user s permission 
in the past  the federal trade commission has investigated companies that have used personally identifiable information without permission or in violation of a stated privacy policy 
under the uk data protection act and the eu data protection directive  a failure to ensure that personal information is accurate and secure or a transfer of personal information to a country without adequate privacy protections could result in criminal or civil penalties 
if we use personally identifiable information without permission or in violation of our policy  we may face potential liability for invasion of privacy for compiling and providing information to our corporate customers and electronic commerce merchants 
government regulation and legal uncertainties could harm our business 
any new law or regulation pertaining to the internet  or the application or interpretation of existing laws  could decrease the demand for our services  increase our cost of doing business or otherwise seriously harm our business 
there is  and will likely continue to be  an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet 
these laws or regulations may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet  online content regulation  user privacy  taxation and the quality of products and services 
furthermore  the growth and development of electronic commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on electronic commerce companies as well as companies like us that provide electronic commerce services 
we file tax returns in such states as required by law based on principles applicable to traditional businesses 
however  one or more states could seek to impose additional income tax obligations or sales tax collection obligations on out of state companies  such as ours  which engage in or facilitate electronic commerce 
a number of proposals have been made at state and local levels that could impose such taxes on the sale of products and services through the internet or the income derived from such sales 
such proposals  if adopted  could substantially impair the growth of electronic commerce and seriously harm our profitability 
legislation limiting the ability of the states to impose taxes on internet based transactions was enacted recently by the united states congress 
however  this legislation  known as the internet tax freedom act  imposed only a three year moratorium on state and local taxes on electronic commerce  where such taxes are discriminatory  unless such taxes were generally imposed and actually enforced prior to october  the legislation  which commenced october  and was to have expired on october   has since been given a five year extension by the house of representatives 
it is unclear which steps the legislature will take next  and failure to continue to renew this legislation would allow various states to impose taxes on internet based commerce 
the imposition of such taxes could impair the growth of the electronic commerce marketplace and impair our ability to remain profitable 
in addition  we are not certain how our business may be affected by the application of existing laws governing issues including property ownership  copyrights  encryption and other intellectual property issues  taxation  libel  obscenity and export or import matters 
the vast majority of such laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet 
as a result  they do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
changes in laws intended to address such issues could create uncertainty in the internet market 
such uncertainty could reduce demand for our services or increase the cost of doing business as a result of litigation costs or increased service delivery costs 

table of contents third parties may bring intellectual property infringement claims against us that would be expensive to defend and  if successful  could subject us to significant liability and block us from using key technology 
from time to time in the ordinary course of business we have been subject to claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties 
any such claims  if made  and any resulting litigation  should it occur  could subject us to significant liability for damages 
in addition  even if we prevail  litigation could be time consuming and expensive to defend  and could result in the diversion of our time and attention 
any claims from third parties may also result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims unless we are able to enter into license agreements that might not be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
terrorist activities and resulting military and other actions could harm our business 
terrorist attacks in new york and washington  dc in september of disrupted commerce throughout the world 
the continued threat of terrorism and the potential for military action and heightened security measures in response to this threat may cause significant disruption to commerce throughout the world 
to the extent that disruptions result in a general decrease in corporate spending on information technology or advertising  our business and results of operations could be harmed 
we are unable to predict whether the threat of terrorism or the responses thereto will result in any long term commercial disruptions or if such activities or responses will have a long term adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
additionally  if any attacks were to affect the operation of the internet or key data centers  our business could be harmed 
these and other developments arising out of the attacks may make the occurrence of one or more of the factors discussed under risk factors likely to occur 
risks related to accounting matters if requirements relating to accounting treatment for employee stock options are changed  we may be forced to change our business practices 
we currently account for the issuance of stock options under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
if proposals currently under consideration by administrative and governmental authorities are adopted  we may be required to treat the value of the stock options granted to employees as compensation expense 
such a change could have a negative effect on our earnings 
in response to a requirement to expense the value of stock options  we could decide to decrease the number of employee stock options granted to our employees 
such a reduction could affect our ability to retain existing employees and attract qualified candidates  and increase the cash compensation we would have to pay to them 
if accounting interpretations relating to revenue recognition change  our reported revenues could decline or we could be forced to make changes in our business practices 
over the last several years  the accounting profession has issued several standards and interpretations relating to revenue recognition 
for example  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position or sop  software revenue recognition  and sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
these standards address software revenue recognition matters primarily from a conceptual level and do not include specific implementation guidance 
in addition  in december  the securities and exchange commission staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab  which explains how the sec staff believes existing revenue recognition rules should be applied 
we believe that our revenue recognition policies are currently in compliance with sop  sop and sab the accounting profession continues to discuss certain provisions of sop and sab as well as other revenue recognition standards with the objective of providing guidance on potential interpretations 
these discussions and the issuance of interpretations  once finalized  could lead to unanticipated changes in our current revenue accounting practices  which could cause us to recognize lower revenues 
these changes may extend sales cycles  increase administrative costs and otherwise harm our business 
risks related to the capital markets we may not be able to secure additional financing to meet our future capital needs 
we currently anticipate that we will remain cash flow positive on a sustained basis 
however  if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to cover our expenses and capital expenditures  we will need to raise additional funds 
we may require additional funding  for example  to fund brand promotion  develop new or enhanced products and services  respond to competitive pressures or make acquisitions 
we may be unable to obtain any required additional financing on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to fund our expansion  successfully promote our brand  develop or enhance products and services  respond to competitive pressures or take advantage of acquisition opportunities  any of which could seriously harm our business 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  our stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interest  and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of the common stock 
if we raise additional funds by issuing debt  its terms may impose limitations on our operations  including limitations on the payment of dividends 
if we do not sustain profitability in the future and are unable to obtain additional financing  then we will eventually be unable to continue our operations 
our stock price may fluctuate significantly regardless of our actual operating performance 
our common stock is listed for trading on the nasdaq national market 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile 
our stock price may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  including actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results and announcements of technological innovations  new products or services offered by us or our competitors  
table of contents changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  changes in research coverage by securities analysts  conditions or trends in the internet services industry and the online customer service segment in particular  any announcement by us of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  sales by current holders of our common stock and general financial conditions and investor sentiment regarding internet companies generally  and other events that may be beyond our control 
in addition  the nasdaq national market  where most publicly held internet companies are traded  has periodically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of an individual company s securities  securities class action litigation often has been instituted against that company 
for example  on october   a putative class action lawsuit captioned leonard turroff  et al 
vs 
ask jeeves  inc  et al 
was filed against us and two of our officers and directors in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  alleging violation of federal securities laws 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
see further discussion of this lawsuit and other litigation in item  legal proceedings 
if we fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the market price of our common stock may decrease significantly 
public market analysts and investors have not been able to develop consistent financial models for the internet market because of the unpredictable rate of growth of internet use  the rapidly changing models of doing business on the internet and the internet s relatively low barriers to entry 
as a result  and because of the other risks noted in this discussion  it may be that our actual results will not meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors in future periods 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock will likely decrease 
future sales of our stock could affect our stock s market price 
if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock  including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options and in connection with acquisitions  the market price of our common stock could fall 
these sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
provisions in delaware law and our charter  stock option agreements and offer letters to executive officers may prevent or delay a change of control 
we are subject to the delaware anti takeover laws regulating corporate takeovers 
these anti takeover laws prevent delaware corporations from engaging in a merger or sale of more than of its assets with any stockholder  including all affiliates and associates of the stockholder  who owns or more of the corporation s outstanding voting stock  for three years following the date that the stockholder acquired or more of the corporation s assets unless the board of directors approved the transaction in which the stockholder acquired or more of the corporation s assets  after the transaction in which the stockholder acquired or more of the corporation s assets  the stockholder owned at least of the corporation s outstanding voting stock  excluding shares owned by directors  officers 
table of contents and employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held under the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer  or on or after this date  the merger or sale is approved by the board of directors and the holders of at least two thirds of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the stockholder 
a delaware corporation may opt out of the delaware anti takeover laws if its certificate of incorporation or bylaws so provide 
we have not opted out of the provisions of the anti takeover laws 
as such  these laws could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change of control of ask jeeves and may discourage attempts by other companies to acquire us 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include a number of provisions that may deter or impede hostile takeovers or changes of control or management 
these provisions include our board is classified into three classes of directors as nearly equal in size as possible with staggered three year terms  the authority of our board to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of these shares  without stockholder approval  all stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called meeting of stockholders and not by written consent  except under limited circumstances  special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board  the chief executive officer  the board of directors or by holders of shares entitled to cast not less than of the votes of the meeting  and except under limited circumstances  no cumulative voting 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control 
furthermore  in april  we adopted a stockholder rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of common stock to stockholders of record as of may  each right entitles the holder to purchase one unit consisting of one one thousandth of a share of our series a junior participating preferred stock for per unit 
under certain circumstances  if a person or group acquires or more of our outstanding common stock  holders of the rights other than the person or group triggering their exercise will be able to purchase  in exchange for the exercise price  shares of our common stock or of any company into which we are merged having a value of the rights expire on may  unless extended by our board of directors 
because the rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to take us over without the approval of our board of directors  our rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock without first negotiating with our board of directors regarding such acquisition 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in investigations and legal proceedings resulting from their services to us  which may include services in connection with takeover defense measures 
these provisions may have the effect of preventing changes in our management 
in addition  our option agreements under the stock option plan provide that if a change of control of ask jeeves occurs prior to the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date of an option  then the vesting which would have occurred by such anniversary shall occur 
after the first anniversary of the date of grant  these option agreements provide that the vesting of each option shall accelerate by six months upon a change of control 
furthermore  offer letters with our executive officers provide for the payment of severance and acceleration of options upon the termination of these executive officers following a change of control of ask jeeves 
these provisions in our stock option agreements and offer letters could have the effect of discouraging potential takeover attempts 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate  market and credit risk and related change in the market values of our investment portfolio 
we place our investment portfolio primarily in high credit  quality  corporate  asset backed  agency and municipal debt instruments 
investments in both fixed and floating rate securities have some degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted by increases in interest rates 
floating rate securities may produce less income than anticipated if interest rates fall 
as a result  changes in interest rates may cause us to incur losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value or may result in lower than anticipated investment income 
our investment portfolio is categorized as available for sale and accordingly is presented at fair value on the balance sheet 
we manage our exposure to interest rate  market and credit risk in the investment portfolio with investment policies and procedures that limit such things as term  credit rating and the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
during the year ended december   the effects of changes in interest rates on the fair market value of our marketable investment securities and our earnings were insignificant 
further  we believe that the impact on the fair market value of our securities and our earnings from a hypothetical change in interest rates would not be significant 
the majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  since a portion of the operations consist of operations outside of the us  we enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily the british pound 
we currently do not hedge our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility  particularly the exchange rate between british pound and the us dollar 
accordingly  the impact of changes in these or other factors could harm our business  operating results and financial condition
