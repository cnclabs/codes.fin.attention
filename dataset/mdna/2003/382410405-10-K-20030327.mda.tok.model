 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires the company to record a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated cost to retire an asset 
the asset retirement liability must be recorded in the periods in which the obligation meets the definition of a liability  which is generally when the asset is placed in service 
when the liability is initially recorded  the company will increase the carrying amount of the related long lived asset by an amount equal to the original liability 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related long lived asset 
upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   the company will recognize transition adjustments for existing asset retirement obligations  long lived assets and accumulated depreciation  all net of related income tax effects  as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle

this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  and are not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial statements

in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements 
certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ending after december  critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements of the company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management must make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
application of certain of the company s accounting policies requires a significant amount of estimates 
these accounting policies are described below 
proved oil and natural gas reserves proved reserves are defined by the securities and exchange commission sec as those volumes of crude oil  condensate  natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
although the company s external engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the sec  the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment 
estimated reserves are often subject to future revision  certain of which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price changes and other economic factors 
changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production  which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities 
reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of depreciation rates utilized by the company 
the company cannot predict the types of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods 
successful efforts accounting the company utilizes the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures 
unsuccessful exploration wells are expensed and can have a significant effect on operating results 
successful exploration drilling costs and all development capital expenditures are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by engineers 
the company also uses proved developed reserves for calculating the amount of expense to recognize for future estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs 
impairment of properties the company continually monitors its long lived assets recorded in property  plant and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet to make sure that they are presented fairly and accurately 
the company must evaluate its properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value 
performing these evaluations requires a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events 
such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves that will be produced from a field  the timing of this future production  future costs to produce the oil and natural gas  and future inflation levels 
the need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors  including a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas  unfavorable adjustments to reserves  or other changes to contracts  environmental regulations or tax laws 
the company cannot predict the amount of impairment charges that may be recorded in the future 
income taxes the company is subject to income and other related taxes in areas in which it operates 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required by management due to timing and the impact of future events on when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by the company 
the company has recorded a deferred tax asset relating primarily to its tax operating loss carryforwards 
the company periodically evaluates its deferred tax asset to determine the likelihood of its realization 
a valuation allowance has been recorded for the deferred tax asset to the extent that they are not likely to be realized based on management s estimation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity hedging activity the company enters into futures contracts or other hedging agreements from time to time to manage the commodity price risk for a portion of its production 
the company considers these to be hedging activities and  as such  monthly settlements on these contracts are reflected in its oil and natural gas sales 
the company s strategy  which is administered by the hedging committee of the board of directors  and reviewed periodically by the entire board of directors  has been to hedge between and of its production 
a portion of the company s hedging arrangements are in the form of costless collars  whereby a floor and a ceiling are fixed 
it is the company s belief that the benefits of the downside protection afforded by these costless collars outweigh the costs incurred by losing potential upside when commodity prices increase 
the remainder of the hedges utilized by the company are in the form of fixed price swaps  where the company receives a fixed price and pays a floating price 
on january   the company adopted a formal policy with respect to hedging arrangements in accordance with accounting pronouncements 
the company does not expect its hedging policy or future hedging practice to differ materially from its historical practice 
the company has no plans to engage in speculative activity not supported by production 
the company s futures contract agreements provide for separate contracts tied to the new york mercantile exchange nymex light sweet crude oil and natural gas futures contracts 
the contracts contain either specific prices or price ranges known as collars that are settled monthly based on the differences between the contract price or price ranges and the average nymex prices for each month applied to the related contract volumes 
to the extent the average nymex price exceeds the contract price  the company pays the difference  and to the extent the contract price exceeds the average nymex price  the company receives the difference 
as of december   the company s open forward position on its outstanding natural gas and crude oil hedging contracts  all of which were with bnp paribas  were as follows natural gas mmbtu per day swap at for january through february  and mmbtu per day with a no cost collar of and per mmbtu for january through december  and mmbtu per day swap at for january through december crude oil barrels of oil per day swap at for january through february  and barrels of oil per day swap at for january through february  and barrels of oil per day swap at for january through february  and barrels of oil per day swap at for march through may  and barrels of oil per day swap at for march through may the fair value of the natural gas and oil hedging contracts in place at december   resulted  in a liability of  the company entered into the following crude oil hedging contracts  all of which were with bnp paribas  subsequent to december  barrels of oil per day swap at for march through may  and barrels of oil per day swap at for june through december  and barrels of oil per day swap at for june through december  and barrels of oil per day swap at for june through december price fluctuations and the volatile nature of markets despite the measures the company has taken to attempt to control price risk  it remains subject to price fluctuations for oil and natural gas sold in the spot market 
prices received for natural gas sold in the spot market are volatile due primarily to seasonality of demand and other factors beyond the company s control 
oil and natural gas prices can change dramatically primarily as a result of the balance between supply and demand 
the company s average natural gas price received for the year ending december   was per mcf  down from per mcf in and down from per mcf in the company s average oil price received for the year ended december   was  up from an average price received of in and down from an average price received of in there can be no assurance that prices will not decline from current levels 
declines in domestic oil and natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and quantities of reserves recoverable on an economic basis 
based on oil and gas pricing in effect at december   a hypothetical increase or decrease in oil and gas pricing would not have had a material effect on the company s financial statements 
debt and debt related derivatives subsequent to december   the company entered into three separate interest rate swaps with bnp paribas over a three year period 
the first interest rate swap  which has an effective date of february  and a maturity date of february  is for  with a libor swap rate of 
the second interest rate swap  which has an effective date of february  and a maturity date of november   is for  with a libor swap rate of 
the third interest rate swap  which has an effective date of november  and a maturity date of february   is for  with a libor swap rate of 
subsequent to implementing the interest rate swap  interest on the company s senior credit facility with bnp paribas will accrue at a rate calculated at the libor swap rate plus  depending on borrowing base utilization  with respect to the notional debt amount of  for debt over and above the  hedged under the interest rate swaps  the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its short term and long term debt with variable interest rates 
based on the overall interest rate exposure on variable rate debt at december   a hypothetical increase in the interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately  disclosure regarding forward looking statements this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this annual report on form k regarding reserve estimates  planned capital expenditures  future oil and gas production and prices  future drilling activity  the company s financial position  business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations  are forward looking statements 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates made by different engineers often vary from one another 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revisions of such estimates and such revisions could change the schedule of any further production and development drilling 
accordingly  reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
additional important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations include changes in oil and gas prices  changes in regulatory or environmental policies  production difficulties  transportation difficulties and future drilling results 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors
