sales of the company increased or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal there were sales increases at both operating subsidiaries in fiscal sales of the company decreased or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the decline in sales in was primarily attributable to a decline in volume at chemdex 
sales at dextran products increased by or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  and accounted for of the company s sales in fiscal dextran products sales accounted for of the company s sales in fiscal demand for dextran and related products increased from the prior year and management expects such demand to continue 
sales levels are expected to increase slightly next year due to continuing demand 
sales at chemdex increased by or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  and accounted for of the company s sales in fiscal the introduction  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  of a new product manufactured under contract accounted for  of this sales increase 
chemdex sales accounted for of the company s sales in fiscal chemdex products are broken down into product lines 
injectables is the largest product line accounting for and of chemdex sales for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
sales of injectable products increased by or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal overall market demand was weak in the food producing animal sector during fiscal this weakness in demand along with unit sales price reductions caused by competitive pricing resulted in decreased sales levels during fiscal this market weakness continued into fiscal  as expected  with modest improvements in the third and fourth quarters 
these market conditions decreased both sales and gross margins in fiscal modest improvements in margins at chemdex were achieved in fiscal over fiscal the company s gross profit increased or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as a percentage of sales  the company s gross profit increased to from in fiscal dextran products gross profit  excluding profit on intercompany sales  was  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal as a percentage of dextran products sales  dextran products gross profit increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in gross profit in fiscal is a result of increased sales levels  particularly of higher margin products 
the majority of dextran products costs are incurred in canadian dollars  while the majority of its sales are in us dollars 
therefore if the canadian dollar decreases in relation to the us dollar  margins increase 
exchange rate fluctuations had no significant impact on margins at dextran products this year 
chemdex gross profit increased or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as a percentage of chemdex sales  chemdex gross profit increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase in gross profit and margin at chemdex was primarily attributable to increased sales levels 
higher sales levels resulted in lower average fixed costs 
other revenue of  in fiscal resulted from a payment from a collaborator on a research and development project 
there were no similar payments received in fiscal or fiscal selling  promotion  general and administrative expenses increased by to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase is a result of senior management bonus accruals of  in fiscal in fiscal  there were no senior management bonuses paid 
in addition  there are increased management salaries and recruiting costs at chemdex due to the hiring of a new general manager in the fourth quarter of fiscal to oversee the management of the vet labs sparhawk joint venture operations on behalf of the company

the current stage of the cellulose sulphate project is such that a lesser portion of development is being performed in house and there is significant funding from research and development partners for the current phase of the project 
there has been a reduction in research and development costs at chemdex in fiscal while the company awaits fda approval on the several new products that have been submitted 
the decrease of  or from fiscal to fiscal was a result of sustained funding by research and development partners 
although funding from all sources for the company s research and development projects is expected to continue in fiscal  the company expects its portion of these costs to return to the levels of fiscal investment tax credits are claimed by dextran products to offset the cost of research and development 
the total investment tax credit benefit recognized in fiscal was  as compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal as a result  the company recorded research and development expense  net of investment tax credits  of   and  in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
depreciation and amortization increased by or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to new production equipment purchased in the fourth quarter of fiscal at dextran products 
interest expense decreased by or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in imputed interest on long term payables of  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the decrease in imputed interest is due to the repayment of this non interest bearing debt 
the company incurred a foreign exchange loss of  in fiscal at dextran products due to the canadian dollar increasing in value relative to the united states dollar 
dextran products has a net exposure to the united states dollar because the majority of its accounts receivable balance is denominated in united states dollars 
in fiscal  there was a foreign exchange gain at dextran products of  because the canadian dollar declined in value relative to the united states dollar 
other expenses amounted to  in fiscal as compared to other income of  in fiscal in fiscal  other expenses relate primarily to legal costs associated with the judicial supervision during the winding up of the vet labs sparhawk joint venture 
in fiscal  legal and receiver fees in connection with this process totaled  in addition  the company has provided an allowance for the entire receivable balance of  due from sparhawk due to the uncertainty related to this situation 
in fiscal  chemdex received a final settlement payment of  from a class action lawsuit against various vitamin suppliers  resulting in the other income realized in that period 
in fiscal  dextran products incurred a loss of  on disposal of production equipment that was netted against other income 
income before income taxes for the company in fiscal totaled  as compared to loss before income taxes of  in fiscal income before income taxes at dextran products in fiscal was  an increase of  or from  in fiscal this increase in income before income taxes is a result of the increase in sales and profit margins  as described above 
chemdex experienced a loss before income taxes of  in fiscal  as compared to income before income taxes of  in fiscal this decrease in income before income taxes is a result of the significant increase in other expenses  as discussed above 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal was  as compared to  in fiscal the provision for income taxes significantly exceeds income before income taxes because of the losses incurred in the bahamas  for which there is no tax recovery  and because a full valuation allowance has been taken against the deferred tax assets relating to non operating losses at chemdex  due to the significant uncertainty of the future of the vet labs sparhawk joint venture as a result of the litigation with sparhawk 
a tax provision of  relating to dextran products was recorded in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal the increase in the canadian tax provision is a result of the increase in profitability and an increase in tax reserves at dextran products in fiscal the canadian operations continue to have significant research and development tax pools to offset current taxes payable 
as a result of the foregoing  the company recorded a net loss of  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal certain events occurring in fiscal could have an impact on future results as follows 
the company is conducting part of its research and development activities through collaboration with scientists from the program for the topical prevention of conception and disease based at the rush presbyterian st 
luke s medical center and the university of illinois in chicago 
the company continues to be supported by assistance from the contraceptive research and development program 
at the present time there are four safety studies underway  with further studies planned for future periods 
a phase i expanded safety study is underway in collaboration with the world health organization in uganda  nigeria and india 
this study will involve women in two treatment groups and two cohorts 
the final report on this study is expected during the fourth quarter of fiscal the second study is a safety study in hiv infected women 
this is being carried out in collaboration with the hiv prevention trials network of niaid in four sites in the united states 
the study will involve women and male partners 
the study is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal the third study is an expanded safety study in the united states at three sites 
this study involves healthy women and is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of fiscal the fourth study is a safety study in cameroon being carried out in collaboration with family health international fhi 
the final report is expected in may usherdex licensee bcy lifesciences has identified usherdex now dcf as its lead drug candidate  completed phase i human clinical trials and commenced phase ii human clinical trials 
the phase ii trial is designed to study the utility of dcf when treating cystic fibrosis 
dcf  a low molecular weight dextran  is delivered by inhalation to the lungs of cf patients 
the compound appears to have utility in thinning the thick mucus associated with cf  while also preventing the adhesion of bacteria to lung epithelial cells 
it is believed that these two actions can be of significant importance to the cf sufferer 
if dcf is able to help in the thinning of mucus  it should enable cf patients to more readily expel the mucus from the respiratory tract  and preventing or reducing the adhesion of bacteria which may help control infection 
the trial is being conducted at six centers in canada and involves some of canada s leading cf physicians 
the vet labs sparhawk joint venture in  vet labs and sparhawk entered into the joint venture for the manufacture and sale of veterinary pharmaceutical products 
vet labs and sparhawk each own of the joint venture 
sparhawk is not affiliated with the company and is owned by the management of the joint venture 
the company controls the joint venture through its control of the board of directors and therefore consolidates its assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses in these financial statements 
the joint venture has been terminated as of december  and is in the process of being wound up and dissolved 
on november   sparhawk filed a petition in the district court of johnson county  kansas against vet labs  chemdex and the company for judicial supervision during the winding up of the joint venture  a request for preliminary injunctive relief allowing sparhawk management access to the manufacturing operations during the winding up  and a declaratory judgment regarding certain interpretations of the joint venture agreement that are in dispute 
no monetary damages have been sought by sparhawk 
a receiver has been appointed by the court to supervise the operations of the joint venture during the winding up process 
the company and sparhawk have agreed to continue the joint venture operations until the court accepts the receiver s final dissolution recommendation 
the company  chemdex and vet labs have filed counterclaims for breach of contract against sparhawk  breach of fiduciary duty against bert hughes and john bascom  the principals of sparhawk  and for declaratory judgment 
no evaluation of the prospects of the declaratory judgment count of sparhawk s lawsuit or any of the company s counterclaims can be made by the company at this time 
the company and sparhawk are actively attempting to settle this dispute 
sparhawk had an option to purchase of the assets held by vet labs 
the purchase price would be equal to of the fair market value of the land  building and equipment owned by vet labs plus  the land and building have been appraised at a valuation of  as of november  the equipment has been appraised at a valuation of  as of january  sparhawk notified the company of its intention to exercise this option in october  but has not yet delivered the purchase price 
under the terms of the joint venture agreement  the joint venture and the option terminated on december  the company believes that this option has now expired because of sparhawk s failure to deliver its purchase price 
sparhawk is disputing this position 
the company cannot at this time estimate the likelihood of sparhawk consummating the exercise of the option and delivering the purchase price 
subject to the exercise of the option  upon winding up of the joint venture  all assets used in the joint venture operations that were owned by the respective members of the joint venture prior to the formation of the joint venture will be returned to the respective owner 
there are no assets of sparhawk included in the consolidated financial statements of the company 
sparhawk does own certain generic products currently produced by the joint venture  all of which belong to the liquids product line  that will be returned to sparhawk 
year to date sales of products owned by sparhawk amount to approximately  at january  several of the products currently produced by the joint venture  including iron dextran  are owned by the company and will be returned to the company 
year to date sales of products owned by vet labs amount to approximately  at january   although ownership of certain of these products may be disputed by sparhawk 
if the lawsuit is not settled  and the operations of the joint venture are would up under judicial supervision  the company expects to continue production of the vet labs products after the winding up  and has hired a general manager to manage this business 
however  no assurance can be given that sales of these products by the company after the dissolution of the joint venture will be consistant with those achieved by the joint venture 
any assets that were purchased by the joint venture and any products that were developed by the joint venture will be distributed to the members of the joint venture as part of the winding up process 
assets and liabilities owned by the joint venture are currently included in the company s financial statements with a book value of  and  respectively 
the company may not receive ownership of the products developed by the joint venture  depending upon the allocation of the joint venture assets upon dissolution 
year to date sales of products developed by the joint venture amount to approximately  it is possible that a negotiated settlement with sparhawk will be reached that would prevent the winding up of the joint venture 
such a settlement would likely result in one of the parties purchasing the other s interest in the joint venture 
there would be no significant impact on the company s results of operations if the company were to purchase sparhawk s interest in the joint venture because the joint venture operations are currently fully consolidated in the company s financial results 
if a negotiated settlement resulted in the company selling its interest in the joint venture to sparhawk or a third party  there would be a significant decline in operating revenues of the company  and a decline in income before income taxes of the company which would potentially be offset by the consideration received by the company in such a sale 
during fiscal  sales of the joint venture amounted to  and income before income taxes totaled  the company does not expect that a sale of its joint venture interest would have an adverse effect on the operations of dextran products  as sales by dextran products to chemdex and the joint venture are not material to the company s overall financial results 
liquidity and capital resources in fiscal the company generated cash of  from its operating activities compared to  for fiscal the decrease in earnings in fiscal discussed above resulted from non cash expenses  including depreciation  deferred income taxes and the write down of a loan to sparhawk 
the company maintained  of working capital and a current ratio of as of january   compared to  of working capital and a current ratio of as of january  at january   the company had accounts receivable of  and  in inventory compared to  and  respectively  at january  the increase in accounts receivable was due to timing of sales at year end 
dextran products had significantly higher sales in january than january  which increased the year end receivables balance 
the increase in inventory levels was due to stocking of a new product at chemdex and additional finished goods to be drop shipped for a customer 
at january   the company had accounts payable of  compared to  at january  the increase in accounts payable was due to timing of supplier payments and the increase in accounts receivable and inventory 
during fiscal  capital expenditures totaled  as compared to  in fiscal the majority of these capital expenditures were for production equipment at the dextran products plant in toronto in both fiscal and the change in the accumulated other comprehensive income is entirely attributable to the currency translation adjustment of dextran products 
dextran products functional currency is the canadian dollar 
this currency translation adjustment arises from the translation of dextran products financial statements to us dollars 
dextran products has a cdn  us  line of credit 
management anticipates using the credit line for the purposes of funding a portion of the costs associated with the refurbishment of the toronto facility 
the joint venture has a  line of credit to fund operations 
there have been no new advances of long term debt or capital lease obligations during fiscal the significant decrease in long term debt and capital lease obligation balances is due to continuing repayments by the company 
the large increase in the current portion of long term debt at january  is because the term loan at the joint venture is due within one year 
the term has not been extended pending resolution of the joint venture dispute 
all long term debt is due in the next two years 
capital lease obligations are due over the next four years 
the amount due from shareholder decreased from  at january  to  at january   due to monthly repayments from the shareholder 
the amount due a different shareholder increased to  at january  from  at january   due to interest charges exceeding the monthly payments made by the company 
no changes in accounting principles or their application have been implemented in the reporting period that would have a material effect on reported income 
changes in the relative values of the canadian dollar and the us dollar occur from time to time and may  in certain instances  materially affect the company s results of operations 
the company does not believe that the impact of inflation and changing prices on its operations are material 
management expects the primary source of its future capital needs to be a combination of company earnings and borrowings 
the company  at present  does not have any material commitments for capital expenditures  although management intends to continue the plant refurbishment process at dextran products in toronto 
the company believes that based upon the current levels of revenues and spending  and taking into account the joint venture litigation  its existing working capital resources will be sufficient to support continuing operations for at least the next months 
management objectives management s primary objectives for the coming year are to increase sales and profitability  to further clinical trials on ushercell and to resolve the dispute with its joint venture partner at chemdex 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  applied on a consistent basis 
the critical accounting policies include the use of estimates and allowances and their impact on accounts receivable  the useful lives of assets and the realizability of deferred tax assets 
management is required to make estimates and assumptions  in preparing the consolidated financial statements  that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods 
the actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant estimates made by management include the calculation of reserves for uncollectible accounts  inventory allowances  useful lives of long lived assets and the realizability of deferred tax assets 
revenue is recognized when product is shipped to the customer provided the company has not retained any significant risks of ownership or future obligations with respect to the product shipped 
since returns are rare and generally not accepted  management has not made provision for returns 
in addition  product sold in bulk quantities is tested  prior to release for shipment  to ensure that it meets customer specifications  and in many cases  customers receive samples for their own testing 
approval is obtained from the customer prior to shipping 
a significant change in these estimates could have a material impact on the results of operations 
accounts receivable are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
allowances for doubtful accounts are determined by each reporting unit on a specific item basis 
management reviews the credit worthiness of individual customers and past payment history to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts 
since the majority of sales at dextran products are export  dextran products maintains credit insurance through a crown corporation for the majority of its customers receivables 
long lived assets are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation or amortization computed using the straight line method based on their estimated useful lives ranging from three to fifteen years 
useful life is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to the company s future cash flows 
a significant change in these estimates could have a material impact on the results of operations 
management has recorded a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets primarily related to operating loss carryforwards of the us operations based on the uncertainty involved with the joint venture 
a change in the outlook for future taxable income in the us operations could result in the recognition of some portion or all of these loss carryforwards  which could result in a material increase in the results of operations through the recovery of deferred tax assets 
risk factors in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed in the joint venture section above  the risks  uncertainties and other factors described below could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  operating results and prospects 
the company s product development efforts may be reduced or discontinued due to difficulties or delays in clinical trials 
to achieve sustained profitability  the company must  alone or with corporate partners and collaborators  successfully research  develop and commercialize identified technologies or product candidates 
current developmental product candidates are in various stages of clinical and pre clinical development and will require significant further funding  research  development  preclinical and or clinical testing  regulatory approval and commercialization testing  and are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of products based on innovative or novel technologies 
they are also rigorously regulated by the us federal government  particularly the fda  and by comparable agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries 
specifically  each of the following is possible with respect to any one of the company s developmental product candidates that the company will not be able to maintain its current research and development schedules  that the company will not be able to enter into human clinical trials because of scientific  governmental or financial reasons  or that it will encounter problems in clinical trials that will cause a delay or suspension of the development of the developmental product candidate  that the developmental product will be found to be ineffective or unsafe  that government regulations will delay or prevent the product s marketing for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon the company s activities  that the fda or other regulatory agencies will not approve the product or the process by which the product is manufactured  or will not do so on a timely basis  and or that the fda s policies may change and additional government regulations and policies may be instituted  which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of the product 
if any of the risks set forth above occurs  the company may not be able to successfully develop its identified developmental product candidates 
the company s developmental product commercialization efforts may not be successful 
it is possible that  for reasons including  but not limited to those set forth below  the company may be unable to commercialize or receive royalties from the sale of any given developmental product  even if it is show it is uneconomical or if the market for the product does not develop or diminishes  the company is not able to enter into arrangements or collaborations to commercialize and or market the product  the product is not eligible for third party reimbursement from government or private insurers  n to be effective  if others hold proprietary rights that preclude the company from commercializing the product  others have brought to market similar or superior products  others have superior resources to market similar products or technologies  government regulation imposes limitations on the indicated uses of the product  or later discovery of previously unknown problems with the product results in added restrictions on the product or results in the product being withdrawn from the market  and or the product has undesirable or unintended side effects that prevent or limit its commercial use 
the company depends on partnerships with third parties for the development and commercialization of its products 
the company s strategy for development and commercialization of its products is to rely on licensing agreements with third party partners 
as a result  the ability of the company to commercialize future products is dependent upon the success of third parties in performing clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals  manufacturing and successfully marketing its products 
there can be no assurance that such third party collaborations will be successful 
if any of the company s current research and development partnerships are discontinued  it may not be able to find others to develop and commercialize its current product candidates 
the company does not currently have agreements with third parties to market many of its developmental products 
the commercialization of any of the company s developmental products that receive fda approval will depend upon the company s ability to enter into agreements with companies that have sales and marketing capabilities 
the company currently intends to sell its products in the united states and internationally in collaboration with one or more marketing partners 
the company may not be able to enter into any such collaboration to market its developmental products in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms  if at all
