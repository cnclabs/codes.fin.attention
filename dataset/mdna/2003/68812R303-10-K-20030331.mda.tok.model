we undertake no obligation to revise the forward looking statements included in this annual report to reflect any future events or circumstances 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of pharmaceutical and diagnostic products 
our strategic goal is to directly participate in the commercialization of products that are used primarily in hospitals 
for diseases treated by larger physician audiences  we seek to discover  develop and commercialize products through alliances with major pharmaceutical companies 
we have nine established product development programs 
we are managing the development and commercialization of our lead product candidate  ramoplanin  in the united states and canada 
this product is in a phase iii clinical trial for the prevention of bloodstream infections caused by vancomycin resistant enterococci vre and a phase ii trial for the treatment of patients with clostridium difficile associated diarrhea cdad 
we have seven product discovery and development alliances with pharmaceutical companies including amgen  astrazeneca  biomerieux  schering plough and wyeth 
in addition  we have a portfolio of internal drug discovery programs 
during  we also maintained an active service business  genomevision tm services  providing drug discovery services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and to the national human genome research institute 
as part of the our continued evolution into a biopharmaceutical company  this business unit was divested in march we concentrate our product discovery  development and commercialization efforts in two principal areas i infectious diseases caused by bacterial and fungal pathogens  and ii human diseases believed to have a significant genetic component 
in october  we acquired an exclusive license in the united states and canada for a novel antibiotic  ramoplanin  from biosearch italia spa  which merged with versicor inc versicor in march subsequently  versicor changed its name to vicuron pharmaceuticals inc vicuron 
we have assumed responsibility for the product development in the united states of ramoplanin  currently in a phase iii clinical trial for the prevention of bloodstream infections caused by vancomycin resistant enterococci vre  as well as a phase ii clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of ramoplanin to treat clostridium difficile associated diarrhea cdad 
our license agreement with vicuron provides us with exclusive rights to develop and market oral ramoplanin in the united states and canada 
vicuron will retain all other rights to market and sell ramoplanin 
in addition  we are obligated to purchase bulk material from vicuron  fund the completion of clinical trials and pay a royalty on product sales 
upon commercialization the combined total of bulk product purchases and royalties is expected to be approximately of our net product sales 
our primary sources of revenue are from alliance agreements with pharmaceutical company partners 
currently  we have seven major product discovery alliances  and we currently receive contract research funding from three of these alliances 
in august  we entered into an alliance with astrazeneca to develop pharmaceutical  vaccine and diagnostic products effective against gastrointestinal infections or any other disease caused by helicobacter pylori h 
pylori 
in august  the contract research under the alliance concluded and the program transitioned into astrazeneca s pipeline 
we are entitled to receive additional milestone payments and royalties based upon the development by astrazeneca of any products from the research alliance 
in december  we entered into an alliance with schering plough 
under this alliance  schering plough can use our staphylococcus aureus staph 
aureus genomic database to identify new gene targets for the development of novel antibiotics 
in march  we had completed our research obligations under this alliance and had turned over validated drug targets and assays to schering plough for high throughput screening 
in december  we entered into our second research alliance with schering plough to identify genes and associated proteins that schering plough can utilize to develop new pharmaceuticals for treating asthma 
in december  we had completed our research obligations under this alliance and the research program has advanced into high throughput screening at schering plough to identify drug candidates 
in september  we established our third research alliance with schering plough for the development of new pharmaceutical products to treat fungal infections 
in march  we had completed our research obligations under this alliance and had turned over validated drug targets and assays to schering plough for high throughput screening 
in september  we entered into a strategic alliance with biomerieux to develop  manufacture and sell in vitro pathogen diagnostic products for human clinical and industrial applications 
as part of the strategic alliance  biomerieux purchased a subscription to our pathogenome tm database and made an equity investment in the company 
in december  we entered into a strategic alliance with wyeth to develop drugs based on our genetic research to treat osteoporosis 
in december  we entered into a strategic alliance with amgen  inc to identify and develop novel therapeutic agents for bone diseases  including osteoporosis 
in and past fiscal years  we have also received revenues from our genomevision tm services business from selling  as a contract service business  high quality genomic sequencing information to our customers 
as part of our continued evolution into a focused biopharmaceutical company  on march   we completed the sale of our genomevision tm services business to privately held agencourt bioscience corporation 
as part of the agreement  we transferred our sequencing operations  including certain equipment and personnel to agencourt 
we will receive a percentage of revenues from commercial and government customers  transferred to agencourt  for a period of two years from the date of sale  as well as shares of agencourt common stock 
we retain rights to our pathogenome tm database product  including all associated intellectual property  subscriptions and royalty rights on products developed by subscribers 
furthermore  we retain the capabilities necessary to satisfy the research needs of our existing product focused alliances  as well as potential new alliances 
we do not expect the sale of the genomevision tm services business to have a significant impact on our net loss during the next two years  as a result of reductions in costs associated with this sale and our rights to receive royalties on gene sequencing revenue earned by agencourt that is related to the transferred business for a period of two years from the date of sale 
in connection with the sale of its genomevision tm services business  we determined that certain equipment related to this segment will no longer be used and will be abandoned subsequent to the sale 
as a result  we revised the estimated useful lives of this equipment and recorded additional depreciation expense of  during the fourth quarter of we also evaluated and wrote down our excess inventory of disposables related to the genomevision tm services business by  during the fourth quarter of additionally  through this divestiture  we eliminated approximately full time positions  of which approximately employees were not offered employment with agencourt 
we will record and pay severance costs of approximately  during the first quarter of related to these employees 
in may  we introduced our pathogenome tm database and sold our first subscription 
since that date  we have continued to contract with subscribers on a non exclusive basis  and  as of december   we had seven subscribers 
in  we entered into an agreement with eragen biosciences  under which they are responsible for the marketing  distribution and maintenance of this product  while we retain our rights to use it and receive a percentage of subscription fees and royalties from subscriber discoveries 
under our agreements  the subscribers receive non exclusive access to information relating to microbial organisms in our pathogenome tm database 
subscriptions to the database generate revenue over the term of the subscription with the potential for royalty payments to us from future product sales 
our revenues relating to subscription fees declined in  and we expect to see a further revenue decline in subscription fees over the next year as subscribers complete their data mining of the pathogenome tm database 
since  the united states government has awarded us a number of research grants and contracts related to government genomics programs 
the scope of the research covered by grants and contracts encompasses technology development  sequencing production  technology automation and disease gene identification 
in july  we were named as one of the nationally funded dna sequencing centers of the international human genome project 
we received funding from the national human genome research institute nhgri of million through june  of which all funds have been appropriated and million has been received through december  as part of the sale of genomevision tm services to agencourt  this program  as well as follow on work associated with this project  is expected to be transferred to agencourt and we expect to receive royalty payments on revenues earned by agencourt for a period of two years from the date of sale 
in october  the nhgri named us as a pilot center to the mouse rat genome sequencing network 
we received million in funding through february with respect to this agreement  of which all funds have been appropriated and million had been received through december  in august  we were named as one of two primary centers for the rat genome sequencing program and agreed to switch its research focus from the mouse program to the rat program 
remaining funds from the mouse program  as well as a portion of the remaining funds from the human genome project  were redirected to the rat genome sequencing program 
any follow on work associated with this grant is expected to be transferred to agencourt and be subject to the terms of the purchase agreement with agencourt 
we receive payments under our biopharmaceutical business from our product discovery alliances based on license fees  contract research and milestone payments during the term of the alliance 
we anticipate that our alliances will result in the discovery and commercialization of novel pharmaceutical  vaccine and diagnostic products 
in order for a product to be commercialized based on our research  it will be necessary for our product discovery partner to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  obtain regulatory clearances  manufacture  sell  and distribute the product 
accordingly  we do not expect to receive royalties based upon product revenues for many years  if at all 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our losses are primarily from costs associated with prior operating businesses and research and development expenses 
these costs have often exceeded our revenues generated by our alliances  subscription agreements and government grants 
our results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and may continue to fluctuate in the future based upon the timing  amount and type of funding 
we expect to incur additional operating losses in the future 
new accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting statement no 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supercedes sfas no

sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with transition provisions for assets held for sale that were initially recorded under previous models apb no 
or sfas no 
and do not meet the new held for sale criteria 
the company adopted sfas no 
in the first quarter of in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
among other things  sfas rescinds statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt and eliminates the requirement that gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt be classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effects  unless the criteria in accounting principles board opinion no

adoption of this statement is generally required in fiscal years beginning after may  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
therefore  sfas eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in eitf the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we will adopt the provisions of sfas for all exit activities  if any  initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others the interpretation which expands on the accounting guidance of statements no 
 and and incorporates without change the provisions of fasb interpretation no  which is being superseded 
the interpretation will significantly change current practice in the accounting for and disclosure of guarantees 
guarantees meeting the characteristics described in the interpretation are to be recognized at fair value and significant disclosure rules have been implemented even if the likelihood of the guarantor making payments is remote 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december   while the initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  certain guarantees are excluded from the initial recognition provisions of the interpretation  however specific disclosures are still required 
we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no

in the fourth quarter of eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities and is effective for agreements entered into during fiscal periods beginning after june  in some arrangements  the different revenue generating activities deliverables are sufficiently separable  and there exists sufficient evidence of their fair values to separately account for some or all of the deliverables that is  there are separate units of accounting 
in other arrangements  some or all of the deliverables are not independently functional  or there is not sufficient evidence of their fair values to account for them separately 
the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of eitf issue no 
will have on its financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of this and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition biopharmaceutical revenues consist of license fees  contract research and milestone payments from alliances with pharmaceutical companies 
genomevision tm services revenues consist of government grants  fees received from custom gene sequencing and analysis services and subscription fees from the pathogenome tm database 
revenues from contract research  government grants  the pathogenome tm database subscription fees  and custom gene sequencing and analysis services are recognized over the respective contract periods as the services are performed  provided there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
license fees are recognized ratably over the performance period in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
milestone payments will be recognized upon achievements of the milestone as long as the milestone is deemed to be substantive and we have no other performance obligations related to the milestone 
unbilled costs and fees represent revenue recognized prior to billing 
deferred revenue represents amounts received prior to revenue recognition 
clinical trial accrual our clinical development trials related to ramoplanin are primarily performed by outside parties 
it is not unusual at the end of each accounting period for us to estimate both the total cost and time period of the trials and the percent completed as of that accounting date 
we also adjust these estimates when final invoices are received 
to date  these adjustments have not been material to our financial statements  and we believe that the estimates that we made as of december  are reflective of the actual expenses incurred as of that date 
however  readers should be cautioned that the possibility exists that the timing or cost of the ramoplanin clinical trials might be longer or shorter and cost more or less than we have estimated and that the associated financial adjustments would be reflected in future periods 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues total revenues decreased from  in to  in biopharmaceutical revenue decreased from  in to  in primarily due to the absence in of milestone payments that were earned in under our product discovery alliances with schering plough and wyeth 
the decrease in biopharmaceutical revenue also reflects lower sponsored research revenue as a result of the completion of our research obligations under our two anti infective alliances with schering plough in march  as well as our strategic decision to seek to partner discovery programs at a later stage of development 
revenue from genomevision tm services decreased from  in to  in primarily due to lower revenues recognized under our government grants with the national human genome research institute to participate in the human genome and mouse rat genome sequencing projects  as well as lower subscription fees earned under our pathogenome tm database business as a result of third parties not renewing their database subscriptions 
costs and expenses total costs and expenses increased from  in to  in cost of services decreased from  in to  in primarily due to decreased costs and expenses associated with the above mentioned decrease in genomevision tm services revenue 
the decrease consisted primarily of lower labor and material costs 
research and development expenses include internal research and development  research funded pursuant to arrangements with our strategic alliance partners  as well as clinical development costs and expenses 
research and development expenses increased from  in to  in this planned increase was primarily due to an increase in expenses incurred in the clinical development of ramoplanin of approximately  as well as increased investment in our internal drug discovery programs  specifically in the area of anti infective and chronic human diseases  of  these increases in research and development expenses were partially offset by a decline in research funded under our product discovery alliances of approximately  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from  in to  in reflecting an expansion in the areas of corporate development and sales and marketing  as well as severance related charges of approximately  associated with our decision to reduce expenditures by eliminating full time staff positions in the areas of early stage research and administration 
interest income and expense interest income decreased from  in to  in reflecting lower interest rate yields from investments  as well as a decrease in funds available for investment 
interest expense increased from  in to  in the increase in interest expense was due to an increase in our outstanding balances under long term obligations from approximately million at december  to million at december  the increase in our long term obligations resulted primarily from the march sale of convertible notes payable in a private placement transaction  which resulted in gross proceeds of million 
interest expense also includes approximately  related to the amortization of deferred issuance costs and warrants issued in connection with the convertible notes payable 
years ended december  and revenues total revenues increased from  in to  in biopharmaceutical revenue increased from  in to  in primarily due to increased milestone payments under our product discovery alliances with wyeth and schering plough 
revenue from genomevision tm services increased from  in to  in due to increased revenue recognized under our commercial sequencing business of approximately  as well as increased revenue recognized under our government grants with the national human genome research institute to participate in the human genome and mouse rat genome sequencing projects of approximately  costs and expenses total costs and expenses increased from  in to  in cost of services increased from  in to  in primarily due to increased costs and expenses associated with the above mentioned increase in genomevision tm services revenue 
the increase consisted primarily of higher labor and material costs 
research and development expenses include internal research and development  research funded pursuant to arrangements with our strategic alliance partners  as well as clinical development costs and expenses 
research and development expenses increased from  in to  in this planned increase was primarily due to costs associated with the acquisition and clinical development of ramoplanin of approximately  as well as increased investment in our internal drug discovery programs of  specifically in the area of anti infectives and chronic human diseases 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from  in to  in reflecting an expansion in the areas of corporate development  sales and marketing and clinical development administrative expenses 
the increase consisted of an increase in payroll and related expenses  as well as recruiting and consulting expenses 
interest income and expense interest income increased from  in to  in reflecting an increase in funds available for investment as a result of i proceeds received from the sale of common stock through public offerings in and  ii proceeds received from the exercise of stock options  and iii proceeds received from our employee stock purchase plan 
interest expense decreased from  in to  in the decrease was due to a decrease in our outstanding balances under long term obligations from approximately million at december  to million at december  liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of cash have been payments received from product discovery alliances  subscription fees  government grants  borrowings under equipment lending facilities and capital leases and proceeds from the sale of debt and equity securities 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term marketable securities of approximately  on march   we sold convertible notes payable to two institutional investors in a private placement transaction  raising million in gross proceeds 
the convertible notes payable may be converted into shares of our common stock at the option of the holder  at a price of per share  subject to certain adjustments 
the maturity date of the convertible notes payable is december   provided  that if any time on or after december  we maintain a net cash balance ie  cash and cash equivalents less obligations for borrowed money bearing interest of less than million  then the holders of the convertible notes payable can require that all or any part of the outstanding principal balance of the notes payable plus all accrued but unpaid interest be repaid 
interest on the notes payable accrues at annually and the interest is payable  in cash or in stock  semi annually on june and december of each year 
as of december   two interest payments on the convertible notes payable had become due and were paid by issuing  shares of our common stock to the holders of the notes payable  of which  and  shares were issued in july and january  respectively 
the investors also received a warrant to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  subject to certain adjustments 
the warrant is exercisable at the time the convertible notes payable are converted or if certain other redemptions or repayments of the convertible notes payable occur and will terminate upon the earlier of four years from date of such conversion or december  the warrant was valued  using the black scholes option pricing model  at  the amount was recorded as a discount to long term debt and will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the convertible notes payable 
additionally  we are obligated to issue a warrant to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share to our placement agent in this transaction 
the warrant is exercisable over a three year term which commenced upon the closing of the notes payable transaction 
this warrant was valued  using the black scholes option pricing model  at  this amount is included in deferred issuance costs and will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the convertible notes payable 
in  we also issued  shares of common stock related to the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan  resulting in proceeds received of approximately  in  we sold  shares of common stock in a series of transactions through the nasdaq national market  resulting in proceeds received of approximately  net of issuance costs 
in  we also issued  shares of common stock related to the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan  resulting in proceeds received of approximately  in  we sold  shares of common stock in a series of transactions through the nasdaq national market  resulting in proceeds received of approximately  net of issuance costs 
in  we issued  shares of common stock related to the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan  resulting in proceeds received of approximately  we received payments of approximately   and  in  and  respectively  from our product discovery partners consisting of up front license fees  contract research funding  subscription fee  milestone payments and expense reimbursement 
we have various arrangements under which we have financed certain office and laboratory equipment and leasehold improvements 
we had an aggregate of approximately  outstanding under our borrowing arrangements at december  this amount is repayable over the next months  with  repayable over the next months 
under these arrangements  we are required to maintain certain financial ratios  including minimum levels of unrestricted cash 
we had no additional borrowing capacity under these capital lease agreements at december  our operating activities used cash of approximately  in primarily due to an increase in our net loss  accounts receivables  unbilled costs and fees and deferred revenue 
these uses of cash were partially offset by a decrease in interest receivable  prepaid expenses and other current assets  as well as an increase in accounts payables and accrued liabilities 
our operating activities used cash of approximately  in and provided cash of approximately  in our investing activities provided cash of approximately  and  in and  respectively  through the conversion of marketable securities to cash and cash equivalents  partially offset by purchases of marketable securities  equipment and additions to leasehold improvements  as well as an increase in other assets in the increase in other assets in reflects the inclusion of deferred issuance costs associated with the convertible notes payable  which will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the convertible notes payable 
our investing activities used cash of approximately  in to purchase marketable securities  equipment and additions to leasehold improvements  partially offset by the conversion of marketable securities to cash and cash equivalents and the sale of certain laboratory equipment 
capital expenditures totaled  during primarily consisting of purchases of laboratory  computer  and office equipment 
we amended an existing capital lease financing arrangement to finance the majority of these capital expenditures 
we currently estimate that we will acquire approximately  in capital equipment in consisting primarily of computers  laboratory equipment  and additions to leasehold improvements 
our financing activities provided cash of approximately  in primarily from proceeds received from the sale of convertible notes payable totaling million in gross proceeds  proceeds received from entering into an additional credit line for  of which  was used to refinance a portion of an existing line of credit  as well as proceeds received from issuances of stock under the employee stock purchase plan 
these proceeds from financing activities were partially offset by payments of long term obligations of  our financing activities provided cash of approximately  and  in and  respectively  primarily from proceeds received from the sale of equity securities  exercise of stock options  and employee stock purchase plan  net of payments of long term obligations 
at december   we had net operating loss and tax credits investment and research carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively  available to reduce federal taxable income and federal income taxes  respectively  if any 
net operating loss carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the internal revenue service and may be limited  in the event of certain cumulative changes in ownership interests of significant shareholders over a three year period in excess of 
additionally  certain of our losses have begun to expire due to the limitations of the carryforward period 
we believe that our existing capital resources are adequate for approximately eighteen months under our current rate of investment in research and development 
there is no assurance  however  that changes in our plans or events affecting our operations will not result in accelerated  or unexpected expenditures 
we plan to continue to invest in our internal research and development programs  primarily in our lead candidate  ramoplanin  currently in a phase iii clinical trial for the prevention of bloodstream infections caused by vancomycin resistant enterococci vre  and a phase ii clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of ramoplanin to treat clostridium difficile associated diarrhea cdad 
we expect to incur approximately million in clinical development expenditures during we plan to seek additional funding in the next months through public or private financing in order to fund our clinical development and research projects 
additional financing may not be available when needed or if available  it may not be on terms acceptable to us 
any additional capital that we raise by issuing equity or convertible debt securities will dilute the ownership of existing stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as specified in our investment policy guidelines  investments are made primarily in high grade corporate bonds with effective maturities of two years or less  and us government agency securities 
these investments are subject to risk of default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our investments as of december  however  the conservative nature of our investments mitigates our interest rate exposure  and our investment policy limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue  issuer  and type of instrument 
we do not expect any material loss from our marketable security investments and therefore believe that our potential interest rate exposure is limited 
we are also subject to interest rate risk through our borrowing activities 
we use united states dollar denominated borrowings to fund certain investment needs 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our  line of credit that bears interest at the prevailing libor rate at december  plus 
a increase in market rates would have increased our interest expense by approximately  in fiscal as of december   we did not have any financing arrangements that were not reflected in our balance sheet 
in  we entered into two separate interest rate swap agreements with a bank for an aggregate amount of approximately  under these agreements  we paid a fixed rate of and received a variable rate tied to the one month libor rate 
as of december   the variable rate was 
these swap agreements met the required criteria set forth in sfas no 
to use special hedge accounting  and we recorded an unrealized loss of  at december   through other comprehensive income  for the change in the fair value of the swap agreements 
at february   this debt had been paid off in its entirety and the interest rate swap agreements expired 
we do not currently own any derivative financial instruments 
the interest rates on our convertible notes payable and capital lease obligations are fixed and therefore not subject to interest rate risk
