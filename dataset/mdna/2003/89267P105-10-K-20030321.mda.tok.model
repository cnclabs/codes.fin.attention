table of contents industry background active trader market the active trader market is usually defined as retail individuals  which include intra day or day traders  semi professionals  active self directed traders  people who trade for themselves as a full time or part time business endeavor  or any other individual that trades much more actively than the typical online trading account 
an active trader has historically been defined as one who trades a minimum of times per month 
the vast majority of active traders are believed to be with traditional online brokerage firms eg  schwab  e trade  ameritrade  td waterhouse  fidelity  td it has been estimated that or more of each traditional online brokerage firm s client base consists of active traders 
all of the large online brokerage firms have tried over the past two to three years to acquire direct access firms or technology  and more sophisticated trading analysis platforms  in order to retain and grow this most valuable segment of their client bases 
there are estimated to be approximately million online accounts today  and direct access accounts many of which are active trader accounts have grown dramatically over the last few years and account for a higher percentage of trading activity of both nasdaq and listed securities 
according to a q report by jpmorgan h q  during the fourth quarter ecns gained market share for the eighth consecutive quarter and accounted for of nasdaq trades 
ecns  of course  are one of the avenues of electronic order placement and execution used by direct access online traders 
according to an april article in traders magazine  of all order flow both listed and nasdaq 
is 
handled electronically today  
and 
it could rise to as much as percent in two years 
the article states that such electronic order flow was placed mostly by self directed and active traders 
active traders are believed to account for more than half of online daily trades approximately million daily trades  and have larger account asset balances under current regulations  a minimum account balance of  is required for day trading 
in the fourth quarter  the average account asset balance of a tradestation securities equities account was more than  we believe an online brokerage focused on active traders  in order to maximize its potential for successful market penetration  needs to deliver strategy testing and automation  and advanced charting and analysis  software streaming  real time quotes  including level ii direct access order placement and execution access to most  if not all  electronic execution agents ecns  supersoes  superdot  etc 
intelligent smart order routing state of the art advanced orders capabilities the ability to use various order placement features limits  trailing stops  simultaneous orders  contingency orders  reserve orders  hidden orders  pegged orders  discretionary orders  etc 
client training services trade desk  brokerage client and technical support services a commission pricing structure that is suitable for active traders 
table of contents tradestation securities offers each of the above mentioned features  including an attractive per share as opposed to per ticket pricing structure 
institutional trader market we see the institutional trader market  as it relates to potential client relationships for direct access brokerage firms like tradestation securities  as hedge fund and money managers  registered investment advisers and commodity trading advisors who use short term trading strategies  and institutional service bureau arrangements 
there are approximately  hedge funds today approximately  of which manage assets under million   commodity pool operators   registered investment advisors  registered commodity trading advisors and  unregistered commodity trading advisors 
a service bureau arrangement is one in which the direct access broker the service bureau provides mainly its technology and systems  and perhaps technical support and minor trade desk support services  to the institutional clients of the broker dealer it serves  but no other brokerage or financial services 
the firm client relationship remains mostly or solely between the end user institutional client and its prime broker dealer who is  in effect  the service bureau s customer 
we do not currently act as a service bureau 
however  it is possible we may be offered  or pursue  such opportunities as we continue to add features attractive to institutional traders to the tradestation electronic trading platform  as discussed in more detail in the next two paragraphs 
we believe it is worth noting that without even taking into account the new institutional features that tradestation offers  tradestation securities electronic trading platform was rated the best institutional platform and the best professional platform in technical analysis of stocks commodities magazine s readers choice awards 
many believe that buy side institutional traders have become less and less pleased with wall street traditional sell side brokerage firms and are moving  to one degree or another  towards using direct access execution of their trading decisions 
the biggest concern institutional traders are said to have today is that the cost of their trades not just commissions  but mainly the costs that result from adverse market movement caused by large block trades is no longer acceptable  particularly given the market conditions of the past three years 
accordingly  these institutional traders are looking for systems that provide the fastest execution at the best prices possible 
the fastest execution is provided by robust direct access technology  and the best prices possible means an exhaustive list of execution venues to ensure maximum access to liquidity through intelligent order routing 
it also means that the direct access platform offers stealthy execution of large block orders anonymity through advanced reserve order  hidden order  discretionary order and order pegging technology technology that enables the trade to be completed with minimal market disturbance 
these basics effective  robust speedy execution  full liquidity all avenues available  advanced order capabilities  and intelligent order routing  must be in place before an institutional fund manager or other institutional buy side trader will consider using a direct access brokerage firm 
these are all strengths of the tradestation electronic trading platform 
other features and services that are important to many buy side institutional traders include sophisticated decision support front ends  automated trading functionality  list basket trading  multiple account trade allocation  and a broad scope of assets stocks  options and futures 
tradestation contains  arguably  the best decision support and automated trading functionality 
table of contents on the market  list basket trading  multiple account trade allocation  and state of the art direct access execution services for both stocks and futures 
it also includes award winning options trading research and analysis functionality 
products and services overview tradestation our main product service offering is the tradestation electronic trading platform  complete with direct access order execution services  for institutional  professional and serious  active individual traders 
a formal patent application covering what we believe to be the unique  powerful technology of tradestation is pending 
tradestation does not provide investment or trading advice or recommendations  or recommend the use of any particular strategy  but rather enables the trader to design  test and automate his own  custom trading strategies 
tradestation is a registered trademark in the united states  australia  canada  the european community  indonesia  korea  singapore  south africa and taiwan 
in addition to offering the tradestation electronic trading platform to the brokerage customers of our tradestation securities subsidiary  we offer  through our tradestation technologies subsidiary  tradestation subscriptions 
the difference between the tradestation electronic trading platform and the tradestation subscription service is that the subscription service does not include order execution or account management capabilities 
tradestation has  since its initial release as a strategy trading software program in  been our flagship product 
from until october it was marketed worldwide to institutional traders on a monthly subscription basis by telerate  inc as a premium tool for the telerate data feed service 
it has also served  and continues to serve  as a strategy trading platform for numerous third party software applications 
its state of the art technology empowers the trader to design and develop a trading strategy based upon the trader s objective rules and criteria  test the potential profitability of that trading strategy against historical data  and then computer automate it to monitor the applicable market and alert the trader in real time when the criteria of the trading strategy have been met and an order should  therefore  be placed 
the principal features of tradestation which enable the trader to design and develop trading strategies are easylanguage and the powereditor 
easylanguage is a proprietary computer language we developed consisting of english like statements and trading terms which can be input by the trader to describe particular objective rules and criteria 
the powereditor is a compiler of easylanguage statements that provides the trader with considerable flexibility to modify and combine different trading rules and criteria  which ultimately result in the design of the trader s trading strategies 
easylanguage and powereditor are also registered trademarks 
brokerage services tradestation securities principal offering today is online brokerage services  covering both equity security and futures transactions  through the tradestation electronic trading platform 
tradestation securities targeted customer base for equity securities and futures brokerage services includes active individual  professional and institutional traders  including hedge fund and money managers and investment advisors who use short term trading strategies 
in addition to providing direct access online services through the tradestation electronic trading platform  
table of contents the brokerage firm offers personal services by its registered representatives who execute customers orders through direct access order execution systems 
having a direct access order execution system  whether accessed directly by the brokerage client through the tradestation electronic trading platform or by a tradestation securities broker on behalf of the brokerage client  means that both the online services and the firm s trading desks are directly connected to stock and futures exchanges and ecn s 
ecn s  such as archipelago  brut and island  directly match anonymous buyers and sellers participating on the network 
this system often results in the simplest  most direct and speediest execution of orders for equity securities at the best available price 
with respect to futures  the tradestation electronic trading platform is directly connected to the futures clearing firm s online execution system which  depending on the type of futures contract  either sends the order directly to the trading pit or  for electronic futures markets  implements an electronic order placement and execution 
in the case of telephone orders  the brokerage s registered representatives are committed to using the firm s trading desks and direct access technology to obtain the fastest execution and best possible price at the time the clients equity securities orders are taken 
the tradestation electronic trading platform offers brokerage clients a new level of online trading empowerment by enabling them to design  test and automate simple or complex trading strategies that instantaneously produce direct access buy or sell orders when the strategies buy or sell conditions are triggered in the markets 
client accounts for equity securities and futures are carried on a fully disclosed basis by the brokerage s clearing firms  bear  stearns securities corp 
and refco  llc  respectively 
tradestation securities executes its clients transactions on an agency basis only  as opposed to a principal basis 
that is  it acts as the agent for its clients directly in the market 
when brokerage firms perform transactions on a principal basis  they are permitted to accept a client s order to purchase  purchase the securities in the market for the brokerage firm  and then sell the securities to the client 
tradestation securities does not mark up its clients equities or futures transactions 
it always charges only an agreed upon commission and never earns income from marking up or marking down its clients equities or futures transactions

we evaluate our approach to subscription fee pricing on an ongoing basis  which has resulted and will likely continue to result in different price offerings during the version of tradestation 
table of contents released in march tradestation also offers our optionstation and radarscreen functions and features  which are described below  as optional services for an increased monthly fee 
from our formation in until the end of  our business consisted mainly of the licensing of strategy trading software products produced and distributed to end user customers on disks 
our most recent version of those client software products  the i line  which includes tradestation i  optionstation i  radarscreen i and prosuite i a combination of the three  was released in february we discontinued active marketing efforts of the i line in may as we focused on the marketing of our then new internet based services  and the completion of our change in business model to a direct access online brokerage founded on our award winning tradestation technology 
the i line is no longer available in the united states 
optionstation i  also an award winning technology  is an options trading analysis product for equities  index and futures options that enables traders to explore options trading strategies 
radarscreen i enables traders to scan up to hundreds or thousands  depending upon the data service and computer hardware used  of equities or other securities to identify potential buying or selling opportunities based upon the traders own trading strategies 
internet based versions of both the radarscreen and optionstation technology have been incorporated into the recently launched tradestation for our and fiscal years  our software products and services operations have been responsible for the majority of our revenues 
in particular  client software products accounted for approximately and of our total revenues in and  respectively 
however  in  and  we expect  for the foreseeable future  our brokerage operations produced and should continue to produce the majority of our revenues 
in  brokerage revenues accounted for approximately of our total revenues  and subscription fee revenues accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
for financial information concerning the software products and services segment of our operations  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of notes to consolidated financial statements segment and related information 
sales and marketing no significant marketing of the tradestation electronic trading platform was commenced until february  when we began daily television advertising of our brokerage services 
we also use print advertising in investor s business daily  technical analysis of stocks commodities and active trader  direct mail and e mail  sales seminars  and our web sites 
the mix and use frequency of television  print  web site  direct mail and in person marketing methods we use to try to achieve results will likely be continually modified as we test such methods and mixtures and analyze and interpret the results 
also  tradestationworld

table of contents easylanguage  many of which are donated by third parties 
the company believes that tradestationworld 
com has generated and will continue to generate renewed and intensified interest in strategy traders who use tradestation trading software  as well as a new generation of traders who wish to embrace strategy trading through state of the art trading software 
less than of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states for the years ended december   and international revenues are collected in us dollars 
strategic relationships clearing services 
our brokerage s clearing services for equities and equities options  and for futures and futures options  are currently provided by bear  stearns securities corp 
and refco  llc  respectively  pursuant to industry standard clearing agreements 
market data services 
the real time market data included in tradestation are licensed from s p comstock  inc technology development we believe that our success depends  in large part  on our ability to offer unique  internet based strategy trading technologies with state of the art  intelligent direct access order execution technologies  and continuously enhance those technologies  as well as develop and implement well designed and user friendly web sites 
to date  we have relied primarily on internal development of our products and services 
we currently perform all quality assurance and develop user education and other training materials internally 
in  and  technology development expenses were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   our technology development team was comprised of persons  as compared to as of december   a decrease 
we view our technology development cycle as a four step process to achieve technical feasibility 
the first step is to conceptualize in detail the defining features and functions that we believe our targeted market requires from the product or service  and to undertake a cost benefit analysis to determine the proper scope and integration of such features and functions 
once the functional requirements of the product or service have been determined  the second step is to technically design the product or service 
the third step is the detailed implementation  or engineering  of this technical design 
the fourth step is rigorous quality assurance testing to ensure that the final product or service generally meets the functional requirements determined in the first step 
several refinements are typically added and tested in the quality assurance phase of development 
once this process is completed  technological feasibility has been achieved and the working model is available for release to our customers 
the market for strategy trading software tools  streaming real time market data and news services  and online order execution services is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards in computer hardware  programming tools and languages  operating systems  database technology and information delivery systems  changes in customer requirements  and frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements 
our success will depend in part upon our ability to develop and maintain competitive technologies 
table of contents and to develop and introduce new products  services and enhancements in a timely and cost effective manner that meets changing conditions such as evolving customer needs  existing and new competitive product and service offerings  emerging industry standards and changing technology 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and market  on a timely basis  if at all  products  services or enhancements that respond to changing market conditions or that will be accepted by customers 
any failure by us to anticipate or to respond quickly to changing market conditions  or any significant delays in the introduction of new products and services or enhancements  could cause customers to delay using  or decide against the use of  our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
client services and support and training we provide client services and support and product use training in the following ways client services and support 
tradestation securities provides telephone client services to its brokerage customers through a trained client services team 
technical support to subscription and brokerage customers who use the tradestation electronic platform is provided by tradestation technologies technical support team 
customers of the i line of products may also receive technical support from tradestation technologies technical support team 
advanced easylanguage consulting services services that technically assist customers in the use of easylanguage to write the customers own trading strategies are also available from internal resources and unaffiliated  independent easylanguage consultants 
a substantial amount of technical support information is also provided on our web sites  tradestationworld 
com and the tradestation securities client support web site 
we try to closely coordinate our brokerage client and technical support services for our brokerage customers who use the tradestation electronic trading platform 
product use training 
we consider user education important to try to help our customers increase their ability to use our products and services fully and effectively 
the majority of our training materials consist of extensive online documentation and technical assistance information on our web sites  including online tutorials  and in person training seminars  so that our customers may learn to use and take full advantage of the sophisticated technology of the tradestation electronic trading platform 
competition the market for online brokerage services is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving  and there appears to be substantial consolidation in the industry of online brokerage services  internet based real time market data services  and trading analysis software tools 
with the tradestation electronic trading platform  we have embraced this evolution and consolidation 
however  we believe that due to the current and anticipated rapid growth of the market for integrated trading tools  real time market data and online brokerage services  competition  as well as consolidation  will substantially increase and intensify in the future 
we believe our ability to compete will depend upon many factors both within and outside our control  including pricing and price pressure  the timing and market acceptance of new products and services and enhancements developed by us and our competitors  our ability to design and support efficient  materially error free internet based systems  market conditions  such as recession  the size of the 
table of contents active trader market today and in the future  the extent to which institutional traders are willing to use direct access brokerage services offered by firms that have traditionally served mostly retail clients  product and service functionality  data availability and cost  clearing costs  ease of use  reliability  customer service and support  and sales and marketing decisions and efforts 
we face direct competition from several publicly traded and privately held companies  principally online brokerages  including providers of direct access order execution services 
our competitors include the many online brokerages currently active in the united states  including ameritrade  inc which recently acquired datek online financial services llc  charles schwab co  inc including the cybertrader and streetsmartpro direct access services  csfbdirect formerly dljdirect  e trade securities  incorporated  fidelity brokerage services  inc  instinet corporation a reuters subsidiary  and an ecn that also provides direct access brokerage service  interactive brokers  jpmorgan  merrill lynch direct  morgan stanley online  quick reilly  inc  redi products  a division of spear  leeds kellogg which is owned by goldman sachs  scottrade  td waterhouse investor services  inc  and terra nova 
those brokers currently serve  in the aggregate  more than of existing online accounts  and many are focusing on attracting and retaining active traders to and who use their services 
many online brokerages currently claim to offer direct access service 
even though we are rated as one of the best  if not the best  direct access brokerage firm in the united states  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such ratings  be rated that highly in the future  compete effectively with our competitors  adequately educate potential customers about the benefits our products and services provide  or continue to offer such products and services 
many of our existing and potential competitors  which include large  online discount and traditional national brokerages  and financial institutions that are focusing more closely on online services  including direct access services for active traders  have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources  greater name recognition and a larger installed customer base than do we 
further  there is the risk that larger financial institutions which offer online brokerage services as only one of many financial services may decide to use extremely low commission pricing as a loss leader to acquire and accumulate customer accounts and assets to derive interest income and income from their other financial services 
we do not offer other financial services  and have no plans to do so  therefore  such pricing techniques  should they become common in our industry  could have a material  adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and business model 
generally  competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products and services than do we 
there can be no assurance that our existing or potential competitors will not develop products and services comparable or superior to those developed and offered by us or adapt more quickly than us to new technologies  evolving industry trends or changing customer requirements  or that we will be able to timely and adequately complete the implementation  and appropriately maintain and enhance the operation  of our new business model 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins  failure to obtain any significant market share  or loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors  or that competitive pressures faced by us will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents intellectual property our success is and will be heavily dependent on proprietary software technology  including certain technology currently in development 
we view our software technology as proprietary  and rely  and will be relying  on a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we have a formal patent application pending for the tradestation trading platform  but software patents  particularly internet related software patents  are increasingly difficult to obtain  and there can be no assurance that we will obtain a patent or patents broad enough in scope to have value  or obtain a patent at all 
we have registered copyright rights in our easylanguage dictionary and documentation and tradestation software 
we have obtained trademark registrations for the tradestation mark in the united states  australia  canada  the european community  indonesia  korea  singapore  south africa and taiwan

we use an online subscription agreement for our internet trading software and data services between tradestation technologies and each of the users whether the users are brokerage customers or monthly subscribers in order to protect our copyrights and trade secrets and to prevent such users from commercially exploiting such copyrights and trade secrets for their own gain 
since these licenses are not physically signed by the licensees  it is possible their enforceability is limited under certain state laws and the laws of many foreign jurisdictions 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties copy or otherwise obtain  use or exploit our software or technology independently 
policing unauthorized use of our software technology is difficult  and we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software technology exists 
piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem  particularly in international markets and as a result of the growing use of the internet 
in addition  effective protection of intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in certain countries  including some in which we may attempt to expand sales efforts 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours 
there has been substantial litigation in the software industry involving intellectual property rights 
we do not believe that we are infringing  or that any technology in development will infringe  the intellectual property rights of others 
the risk of infringement by us is heightened with respect to our tradestation and tradestation technology  as that technology has not stood any significant test of time as has our legacy client software technology 
there can be no assurance that infringement claims would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  to the extent that we acquire or license a portion of the software or data included in our products or services from third parties all data is licensed from third parties  or market products licensed from others generally  our exposure to infringement actions may increase because we must rely upon such third parties for information

in the future  litigation may be necessary to establish  define  enforce and protect trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks and other intellectual property rights 
we may also be subject to litigation to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the intellectual property rights of others 
any such litigation could be costly and divert management s attention  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
adverse determinations in such litigation could result in the loss of proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from third parties  which could be expensive  or prevent us from selling our products or services or using our trademarks  any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
government regulation our brokerage subsidiary  tradestation securities  is subject to extensive securities and futures industry regulation under both federal and state laws as a broker dealer with respect to its equities business and as an introducing broker with respect to its futures business 
broker dealers and introducing brokers are subject to regulations covering all aspects of those businesses  including sales methods  trade practices  use and safe keeping of customers funds and securities  arrangements with clearing houses  capital structure  record keeping  conduct of directors  officers and employees  and supervision 
to the extent tradestation securities solicits orders from customers or makes investment recommendations  it is subject to additional rules and regulations governing  among other things  sales practices and the suitability of recommendations to its customers 
tradestation securities mode of operation and profitability may be directly affected by additional legislation  changes in rules promulgated by the securities and exchange commission sec  the national association of securities dealers nasd  the commodity futures trading commission cftc  the national futures association nfa  the board of governors of the federal reserve system  the various stock and futures exchanges and other self regulatory organizations  and changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and laws  particularly any changes focused on online brokerages that target an active trader customer base 
with respect to active trading  the nasd has adopted rules that require firms to provide customers with a risk disclosure statement about active trading 
further  the nasd and nyse s margin rules impose more restrictive requirements for pattern active traders 
governmental concern is focused in two basic areas that the customer has sufficient trading experience and has sufficient risk capital to engage in active trading 
a minimum equities account balance of  is required 
tradestation securities customer account documentation specifies that being a brokerage customer of tradestation securities is only for traders who have experience in active trading  are willing to risk considerable amounts of capital at least  and are interested in engaging in high risk  speculative trading activity 
we believe our brokerage firm s minimum suitability requirements  as well as the extensive user education documentation and tutorials offered on our web site  are consistent with both the letter and the spirit of nasd rules and regulations concerning active trading 

table of contents the sec  the nasd  the cftc  the nfa and other self regulatory organizations and state securities commissions can censure  fine  enjoin  suspend  expel or issue cease and desist orders to a broker dealer or introducing broker or any of its officers or employees 
marketing campaigns by tradestation securities to bring brand name recognition to it and to promote the benefit of its services  such as the tradestation electronic trading platform and its direct access electronic order execution  are regulated by the nasd and nfa  and all marketing materials must be reviewed by an appropriately licensed tradestation securities principal prior to release  and must conform to standards articulated by the sec  nasd and nfa 
the nasd or nfa may request that revisions be made to marketing materials  and can impose certain penalties for violations of its advertising regulations  including censures or fines  a requirement of advance regulatory approval of all advertising  the issuance of cease and desist orders  and the suspension or expulsion of a broker dealer or introducing broker or any of its officers or employees 
the sec  the nasd  the cftc and the nfa and various other regulatory agencies have stringent rules with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by securities broker dealers and introducing brokers 
net capital is the net worth of a broker or dealer assets minus liabilities  less deductions for certain types of assets as well as other charges 
if a firm fails to maintain the required net capital it must cease conducting business and  if it does not do so  it may be subject to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec or the cftc and suspension or expulsion by the nasd or nfa  and it could ultimately lead to the firm s liquidation

it is possible that other federal or state agencies will attempt to regulate our current and planned online and other electronic service activities with rules that may include compliance requirements relating to record keeping  data processing  other operation methods  privacy  pricing  content and quality of goods and services as the market for online commerce evolves 
because of the growth in the electronic commerce market  congress had held hearings on whether to regulate providers of services and transactions in the electronic commerce market 
as a result  federal or state authorities could enact laws  rules or regulations  not only with respect to online brokerage services  but other online services we provide or may in the future provide 
such laws  rules and regulations  if and when enacted  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 

table of contents employees as of december   we had full time equivalent employees consisting of in technology development  including software engineering  product management  user education and quality assurance  in sales and marketing relating to brokerage services  subscriptions and software products including in sales  on the trading desk  in client services and software support and in marketing and fulfillment  and in general and administrative  including executive management  finance  information technology services and human resources 
our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining organization  and we have never experienced a work stoppage and consider our relations with our employees to be good 
our future success depends  in significant part  upon the continued service of our key senior management  technology and sales and marketing personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on us 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key personnel 
departures and additions of personnel  to the extent disruptive  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item properties in november  we signed a ten year lease with two year renewal options that commenced in the summer of for an approximately  square foot corporate headquarters in plantation  florida 
plantation is just west of ft 
lauderdale  florida broward county 
this headquarters consolidated personnel and operations of the miami and boca raton offices 
our former corporate headquarters was located in miami  florida  in a leased facility consisting of approximately  square feet of office space that expired in august our brokerage operations were formerly conducted chiefly from  square feet of office facilities in boca raton  florida pursuant to a lease that expires in part of which is now being subleased 
we also had leased a second facility in boca raton  florida  consisting of approximately  square feet of space  for additional technology development and data services operations 
that lease was terminated as of december  the brokerage had small branch offices in osterville  massachusetts  pittsburgh  pennsylvania  and hudson and cincinnati  ohio  all of which have been  or are in the process of being  closed 
the technologies subsidiary has an approximately  square foot leased facility in richardson  texas from which certain data services development and technical operations are conducted 
commencing january  a portion of those facilities serve as a branch office for tradestation securities 
that lease expires july  we also lease space for our data server farms at two sites  one in richardson  texas  and one in miami  florida 
none of the facilities described in this paragraph were affected by the consolidation of the south florida operations in plantation last summer 

table of contents we believe that our existing facilities are adequate to support our existing operations and that  if needed  we will be able to obtain suitable additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms 
item legal proceedings in october  we received information about alleged fraudulent conduct by an executive of a company that referred individual accounts to tradestation securities 
the executive of the referral company was authorized to trade on behalf of such individuals and allegedly issued fraudulent account statements to them 
the referred account holders incurred several million dollars of trading losses  in the aggregate  during the time the executive of the referral company traded on their behalves 
on february   the referral company communicated to tradestation securities in writing that it believes tradestation securities shares responsibility for some or all of the alleged losses incurred by the referred account holders and or the referral company and wishes to make an amicable settlement

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report description of business and summary of significant accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
brokerage revenues 
brokerage revenues are the key component of our results of operations and are comprised primarily of brokerage commissions and fees earned from our clients brokerage transactions and  to a lesser extent  platform fees earned from brokerage customers using the tradestation electronic trading platform and interest earned from interest revenue sharing arrangements with the brokerage s clearing firms 
brokerage commissions and fees and their related clearing costs are recorded on a trade date basis as transactions occur 
platform fees and interest are recorded monthly  when earned 
income taxes 
management determines any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred income tax assets  which includes the benefit from net operating loss carryforwards 
for the years ended december  and  a valuation allowance was recorded to offset the tax benefit of all current period changes in deferred income taxes 
during the fourth quarter  we recorded a million charge establishing a full valuation allowance against our previously recorded deferred income tax assets and we have continued to apply a full valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets in as of december   we have approximately million of deferred income tax assets that have been fully reserved  the benefit of which may be recorded in future periods should realization become more likely than not 
see income taxes below  and note of notes to consolidated financial statements income taxes 
insurance claim 
in june  we made a claim of million with our insurance carrier relating to a trading error made with respect to a client s account

uninsured loss reserves 
we decided  as of june   to no longer carry errors or omissions insurance that covers third party claims made by brokerage clients or software subscribers as a result of alleged human or system errors  failures  acts or omissions 
this decision was made based upon our assessment of the potential risks and benefits  including significant increases in premium rates  deductibles and coinsurance amounts  reductions in available per occurrence and aggregate coverage amounts  and the unavailability of policies that sufficiently cover the types of risks that relate to our business 
each quarter  we continue to evaluate our accruals for settlements related to claims and potential claims 
estimates of settlements for such potential claims  including related legal fees  are accrued in the consolidated 
table of contents financial statements 
the ultimate outcome of such potential claims may be substantially different than our estimates 
see brokerage services segment operating expenses general and administrative 
sublease of facilities 
during the second quarter of  we completed the consolidation of our florida operations to one location 
based upon advice from our outside real estate advisors  using current market factors  we estimated the potential losses relating to the sublease of facilities that we will no longer occupy 
during the year ended december   we increased our estimated loss accrual by  while net payments of  were applied against this accrual  resulting in a balance of  as of december  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
in december  we recorded a non cash charge of million for impairment of goodwill and certain intangible assets due to certain operational decisions made by management which resulted in the reduction of the fair value of such assets 
the fair value was determined by a qualified independent appraiser  representing the price at which the assets would change hands between a willing buyer and seller 
this charge was recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

in april  our new brokerage commission plan one that charges traders fees based solely upon the share volume of client trades as opposed to per ticket charges became effective 
the new plan  as expected  significantly reduced our commissions per trade 
this reduction was partially offset by charging brokerage clients monthly platform fees 
in august  we modified our price per share plan by reducing the price per share 
additionally  as compared to the first half of  media advertising expenditures were reduced during the second half of continued price pressure on online brokerage commissions and fees  as well as our ability to maintain or improve revenue growth with reduced advertising expenditures  are challenges we expect to face for the foreseeable future

based upon our decision made in december to sell those accounts as they did not meet the requirements of our active and institutional trader business model  we determined that these intangible assets were impaired and  therefore  they were reduced to their estimated fair value  as determined by an independent appraisal

off balance sheet arrangements the brokerage s client securities and futures activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis 
in margin transactions  the brokerage may be obligated for credit extended to its clients by the brokerage s clearing firms  subject to various regulatory and clearing firm margin requirements  collateralized by cash and securities in the clients accounts 
in connection with these activities  the brokerage executes client transactions involving the sale of securities not yet purchased  substantially all of which are transacted on a margin basis subject to individual exchange regulations 
such transactions may expose the brokerage to significant off balance sheet risk in the event margin requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that clients may incur 
in the event the client fails to satisfy its obligations  the brokerage may be required to purchase or sell financial instruments at prevailing market prices to fulfill the client s obligations 
we seek to control the risks associated with brokerage client activities by requiring clients to maintain margin collateral in compliance with the brokerage s clearing firms requirements as well as various regulatory requirements 
the brokerage as well as its clearing firms  monitor required margin levels daily and require the clients to deposit additional collateral or to reduce positions when necessary 
the brokerage client financing and securities settlement activities require the clearing firms to pledge client securities as collateral in support of various secured financing sources such as bank loans and securities loaned 
in the event the counterparty is unable to meet its contractual obligation to return client securities pledged as collateral  the brokerage may be exposed to the risk of acquiring the securities at prevailing market prices in order to satisfy its clients obligations 
we control this risk by monitoring the market value of securities pledged on a daily basis and by requiring adjustments of collateral levels in the event of excess market exposure 
in addition  we establish credit limits for such activities and monitor compliance on a daily basis 
recently issued accounting standards we adopted sfas no

issues  uncertainties and risk factors the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as the business section of this report  should be read and evaluated together with the issues  uncertainties and risk factors relating to our business described below 
while we have been and continue to be confident in our business and business prospects  we believe it is very important that anyone who reads this report consider these issues  uncertainties and risk factors  which include business risks relevant both to our industry and to us in particular 
these issues  uncertainties and risk factors are not intended to be exclusive 
issues  uncertainties and risk factors are also included in other sections of this report when specifically relevant to a statement we have made about an aspect of our business  or our financial condition or results of operations 
this report also contains statements that are forward looking within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of when used in this report  the 
table of contents words believes  plans  estimates  expects  intends  designed  anticipates  may  will  should  could  become  upcoming  potential  pending  and similar expressions  if and to the extent used  are intended to identify the forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements are based on current expectations and beliefs concerning future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties  including the risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this report 
actual results may differ materially from the results suggested in this report 
factors that may cause or contribute to such differences  and our business risks and uncertainties generally  include  but are not limited to  the items described below  as well as those described in other sections of this report  our other public filings and our press releases 
there are several factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  which could result in significant volatility in our stock price 
quarterly revenues and operating results of tradestation group and its predecessor companies have fluctuated significantly in the past  and our quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future 
causes of such significant fluctuations may include  but are not limited to the effect of our new commission pricing structure which was implemented in the second quarter and significantly modified in the third quarter  and of additional price reductions that are implemented in  such as our recent reductions in commission pricing for futures and options trades  market or competitive pressure to continue to lower commissions and fees charged to customers  increases in clearing costs we recently received notice from our futures clearing firm that our clearing costs will substantially increase  and as a result  we are in the process of evaluating our options  the quality and success of  and potential continuous changes in  sales or marketing strategies which have undergone significant change recently and are expected to continue to evolve and the costs allocated to marketing campaigns and the timing of those campaigns  particularly our recent decision to reduce advertising expenditures during the second half of and further reduce advertising expenditures during  the appeal of our products and services to the institutional trader market given our limited experience selling to that market  variations from our expectations with respect to hiring and retention of personnel  sales and marketing expenditures  product development  customer account growth  customer trading activity and the share volume of their trades  or other revenue or expense items  if revenues are lower than budgeted expectations  our inability to make in a timely fashion commensurate expense reductions as a large amount of our expenses do not vary with revenues in the short term  the effect of enhancements to the tradestation electronic trading platform ie  tradestation and other future versions  
table of contents changes in demand for our products and services due to the rapid pace at which new technology is offered to customers in our industry  general economic and market factors that affect active trading  including market volume  market volatility  market direction  the level of confidence and trust in the markets  and seasonality summer months and holiday seasons typically being slower periods  pending or potential third party claims that turn out to be significantly more or less costly than we currently estimate  costs or adverse financial consequences that may occur with respect to regulatory compliance or other regulatory issues  particularly relating to laws  rules or regulations that may be enacted with a focus on the active trader market  and the size and frequency of any trading errors for which we ultimately suffer the economic burden  in whole or in part including losses from third party claims that may arise from time to time as of june   we have not carried errors or omissions insurance for third party claims 
conditions in the securities and financial markets may affect our rates of customer acquisition  retention and trading activity our products and services are  and will continue to be  designed for customers who trade actively in the securities and financial markets 
there have been for the past years  and continues to be  unfavorable conditions in the securities and financial markets 
to the extent that interest in active trading has decreased or in the future decreases due to low trading volumes  lack of volatility  or significant downward movement in the securities or financial markets  such as has recently occurred  or future tax law changes  recessions  depressions  wars  terrorism including cyberterrorism  or otherwise  our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected 
also  unfavorable market conditions may result in more losses for our clients  which could result in increases in quantity and size of errors or omissions claims that may be made against us by clients 
we do not currently carry any errors or omissions insurance that might cover  in part  some of those potential claims 
see the nature of our business results in potential liability to customers below 
our industry is intensely competitive  which makes it difficult to attract and retain customers the markets for online brokerage services  trading software tools  and real time market data services are intensely competitive and rapidly evolving  and there has been substantial consolidation of those three products and services occurring in the industry 
we believe that competition from large online brokerage firms and smaller brokerage firms focused on active traders  as well as consolidation  will substantially increase and intensify in the future 
competition may be further intensified by the size of the active trader market  which is generally thought to be comprised of less than of all online brokerage accounts 
we believe our ability to compete will depend upon many factors both within and outside our control 
these include pricing and price pressure  the timing and market acceptance of new products and services and enhancements developed by us and our competitors  our ability to design and 
table of contents support efficient  materially error free internet based systems  market conditions  such as recession  the size of the active trader market today and in the future  the extent to which institutional traders are willing to use direct access brokerage services from firms that have traditionally served mostly retail clients  product and service functionality  data availability and cost  clearing costs  ease of use  reliability  customer service and support  and sales and marketing decisions and efforts 
systems failures may result in our inability to deliver accurately  on time  or at all  important and time sensitive services to our customers the online electronic trading platform we provide to our clients is based upon the integration of our sophisticated front end software technology with our equally sophisticated internet based server farm technology 
our server farm technology is the foundation upon which online trading clients receive real time market data and place buy and sell orders 
however  in order for this technology to provide a live  real time trading platform  it requires integration with real time market data  which are currently provided by the systems of independent third party market data vendors who obtain the data directly from the exchanges  the electronic order book systems of ecns and electronic systems offered by the exchanges  and the clearing and back office systems of the clearing firms we currently use 
accordingly  our ability to offer a platform that enables the development  testing and automation of trading strategies and the placement and execution of buy and sell orders depends heavily on the effectiveness  integrity  reliability and consistent performance of all of these systems and technologies 
in particular  the stress that is placed on these systems during peak trading times could cause one or more of these systems to operate too slowly or fail 
we have experienced several delays and outages since we launched our online trading platform  many of which related to data vendor  exchange  clearing firm and ecn outages or issues which are beyond our control 
also  a hardware or software failure  software design limitations or errors  power or telecommunications interruption or natural disaster could cause a systems failure or other potentially damaging results 
when systems in the trading process slow down significantly or fail  even for a short time  our brokerage customers could suffer delays in trading  or unintended results or other problems  potentially causing losses and possibly subjecting us to claims for such losses 
such failures or delays  depending upon how often they occur and how serious they are  could also result in our clients and client prospects losing or failing to gain confidence in our trading platform 
additionally  as a general matter not applicable only to our company  the integrity of these types of systems is increasingly being attacked by persons sometimes referred to as hackers who intentionally introduce viruses or other defects to cause damage  inaccuracies or complete failure 
also  cyberterrorism  should it occur  may significantly affect people s willingness to use internet based services  particularly ones that involve their personal or company s assets 
during a system outage  our brokerage may be able to take orders by telephone  however  only associates with appropriate securities broker s licenses can accept telephone orders  and an adequate number of associates likely would not be available to take customer calls in the event of a systems failure 
system delays  errors  outages and failures  depending upon how serious and how often they occur  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
see the nature of our business results in potential liability to customers below 

table of contents the nature of our business results in potential liability to customers many aspects of the securities brokerage business  including online trading services  involve substantial risks of liability 
in recent years there has been an increasing incidence of litigation involving the securities brokerage industry  including class action and other suits that generally seek substantial damages  including in some cases punitive damages 
our proprietary order routing technology is designed to automatically locate  with immediacy  the best available price in the appropriate market in completing execution of a trade triggered by programmed market entry and exit rules 
there are risks that the electronic communications and other systems upon which these products and services rely  and will continue to rely  or our products and services themselves  as a result of flaws or other imperfections or limitations in their designs or performance  may operate too slowly  fail  cause confusion or uncertainty to the user  or operate or produce results not understood or intended by the user 
an investor or trader using either the full electronic trading platform or our subscription service might claim that investment or trading losses or lost profits resulted from use of a flawed version of one of our trading software tools or inaccurate assumptions made by the trading software tools regarding data  or inaccurate data 
major failures of this kind may affect all customers who are online simultaneously 
any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
we do not currently carry any errors or omissions insurance that might cover  in part  some of the above described risks 
while our contracts with customers are  we believe  clear that customers who do business with us must knowingly assume all of the risks described above  there can be no assurance that a judge  arbitrator or regulator would enforce or honor such contractual provisions 
see conditions in the securities and financial markets may affect our rates of customer acquisition  retention and trading activity  and systems failures may result in our inability to deliver accurately  on time  or at all  important and time sensitive services to our customers above 
dependence upon outside data sources and clearing relationships creates risks outside of our control which may affect our ability to provide  and our cost to provide  market data and clearing and account services our business is currently dependent upon our ability to maintain contracts with private market and news data vendors and clearing firms in order to provide market data and news and clearing and account services  respectively  to our customers 
we obtain the market data and news pursuant to non exclusive licenses from private data vendors who in turn obtain the data from exchanges and news sources  and the clearing and back office account services are obtained from large brokerage firms 
the data contracts typically provide for royalties based on usage or minimums  and the clearing contracts provide for transactional clearing fees and charges 
while we are not aware of any material data vendor or clearing services contracts that are in jeopardy of being terminated or not renewed  there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew or maintain our current contracts or acceptable price levels 
in fact  our futures clearing firm recently notified us of a substantial increase in our clearing costs  and as a result  we are in the process of evaluating our options 
if any of those relationships becomes unfavorable or is terminated  and we decide to provide data services directly from the exchanges  or self clear client trades and carry client accounts  we would face significant infrastructure expansion costs  and would be engaging in business operations in which we have little or no prior experience 
these risks and uncertainties would need to be considered when evaluating the potential cost benefit and operational efficiency and 
table of contents quality that our direct performance of such services could provide 
as a general matter  termination of our relationship with one or more of these third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
we may not be able to adequately protect or preserve our rights in intellectual property our success is and will continue to be heavily dependent on proprietary technology  including existing trading software  internet  web site and order execution technology  and those types of technology currently in development 
we view our technology as proprietary  and rely  and will be relying  on a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
policing unauthorized use of our products and services is difficult  however  and we may be unable to prevent  or unsuccessful in attempts to prevent  theft  copying or other unauthorized use or exploitation of our product and service technologies 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect or defend our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies or products and services 
we do not have a long operating history as an online brokerage firm and  until very recently  have not operated profitably 
we launched the tradestation electronic trading platform at the end of the second quarter 
prior to that  our brokerage operations consisted mainly of brokers taking phone calls from clients and then placing those clients orders via direct access order execution 
accordingly  the online brokerage business  as currently conducted  has a relatively short operating history 
further  the second  third and fourth quarters of were the first profitable quarters we have had since the third quarter of this lack of operating history  and our lack of historical profitable results over the last three years  should be taken into account when evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
we may need cash in the foreseeable future while we anticipate having sufficient cash to meet our needs over the next months  our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the rate of customer acceptance of our products and services  including the number of new brokerage accounts acquired and the number and volume of trades made by our brokerage customers  price competition that may result in us continuing to charge lower commissions and fees to customers  significant  increased infrastructure costs as our business grows  and competing technological and market developments 
funds may be raised through debt financing and or the issuance of equity securities  there being no assurance that any such type of financing on terms satisfactory to us will be available or otherwise occur 
any equity financing or debt financing which requires issuance of equity securities or warrants to the lender would reduce the percentage ownership of the shareholders of the company 
shareholders also may  if issuance of equities occurs  experience additional dilution in net book value per share  or the issued equities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing shareholders 

table of contents our business model has no significant historical record  which makes business planning difficult because our business model  ie  a direct access brokerage based upon a sophisticated internet based strategy trading software platform  is one with no significant historical record for our company  and  to our knowledge  one with no significant historical record for any other company  our attempts to predict the size of our market and our potential market share  to anticipate revenues and costs  to prepare budgets  and to make decisions regarding obtaining third party financing that may be required will generally be based upon theoretical assumptions 
future events and results may differ drastically from those planned or anticipated  which  if negative  would result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
see we may need cash in the foreseeable future above 
the internet  as it grows  may have problems that affect our business there is the risk that  over time  the internet may not prove to be a viable commercial marketplace because of a failure to continue to develop the necessary infrastructure 
the internet has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  significant growth in the number of users and amount of traffic 
there can be no assurance that the internet infrastructure will continue to be able to support the demands placed on it by this continued growth 
operation in a highly regulated industry and compliance failures may result in severe penalties and other harmful governmental actions against us the securities industry is subject to extensive regulation covering all aspects of the securities business 
regulatory authorities are currently focusing intensely on the online trading industry  particularly the segment that seeks the accounts of active traders 
the various governmental authorities and industry self regulatory organizations that supervise and regulate our brokerage firm have broad enforcement powers to censure  fine  suspend  enjoin  expel or issue cease and desist orders to our brokerage firm or any of its officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations 
additionally  new rules relating to active traders have recently been enacted and more may be enacted which severely limit the operations and potential success of our business 
our ability to comply with all applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our brokerage s maintenance of compliance and reporting systems  as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other personnel 
our brokerage could be subject to disciplinary or other regulatory or legal actions in the future due to noncompliance 
the loss of key employees could decrease the quality of our management and operations our success depends to a very significant extent on the continued availability and performance of a number of senior management  technology and sales and marketing personnel 
the loss of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our company 

table of contents there are risks relating to our ability to maintain customer privacy and security and that increased government regulation of internet business may occur customers may refuse to transact business over the internet  particularly business  such as ours  that involves the handling of significant amounts of customers funds  due to privacy or security concerns 
this risk will grow if  as and to the extent cyberterrorism occurs or is perceived to be a viable  prominent threat or likelihood to occur 
we currently incorporate and plan to continue to incorporate security measures into our privacy policies 
however  a major breach of customer privacy or security could have serious consequences for our internet based operations 
use of the internet  particularly for commercial transactions  may not continue to increase as rapidly as it has during the past few years as a result of privacy or security concerns  or for other reasons 
if this occurs  the growth of our operations would be materially hindered 
if internet activity becomes heavily regulated in these respects  that could also have significant negative consequences for the growth of our current and planned operations 
we may be subject to intellectual property litigation there has been substantial litigation in the software industry involving intellectual property rights 
although we do not believe that we are or will be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others  there can be no assurance that infringement claims  if asserted  would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects  or result in our being unable to use intellectual property which is integral to one or more of our products or services 
the risk of infringement claims is heightened with respect to some of the tradestation and technology because that technology  as opposed to our historical client software technology  has not stood any significant test of time 
our brokerage must meet net capital requirements as a broker dealer that  if not complied with  could result in severe penalties  and which at all times limit our right to use all of the brokerage s cash the sec  the nasd and various other regulatory agencies have stringent rules with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by securities broker dealers 
net capital is the net worth of a broker or dealer assets minus liabilities  less deductions for certain types of assets as well as other charges 
if a firm fails to maintain the required net capital it may be subject to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec and suspension or expulsion by the nasd  and it could ultimately lead to the firm s liquidation 
if such net capital rules are changed or expanded  or if there is an unusually large charge against net capital  operations that require the use of capital would be limited 
also  our ability to withdraw capital from our tradestation securities brokerage subsidiary is subject to sec rules  which in turn could materially impact our available working capital and materially impact or limit our ability to repay debt as and when due  redeem or purchase shares of our outstanding stock  if required or desirable  and pay dividends in the future 
a large operating loss or charge against net capital could adversely affect our ability to expand or even maintain our then present levels of business  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
see we may need cash in the foreseeable future above
