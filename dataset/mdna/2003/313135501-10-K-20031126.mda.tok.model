critical accounting estimates and judgements estimates in preparing financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
deferred tax assets at august   the company has foreign net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million  for which the company has recorded a deferred tax asset 
for the company to realize the benefit of its deferred tax asset  the company must achieve future earnings prior to the expiration of its net operating loss carry forwards 
the company has established a valuation allowance against the future tax benefit of a portion of its net operating loss carry forwards 
the company may need to further adjust that valuation allowance if future earnings are  or are projected to be  significantly different from current estimates 
the valuation allowance reflects the uncertainty associated with the realization of deferred tax assets 
the increase in the valuation reserve was due primarily to foreign net operating losses 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill the company reviews long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group should be assessed 
the company assesses the carrying amount of the asset or asset group by comparing the carrying amount to the estimate of cash inflows  net of outflows 
if the estimated net cash inflows are less than the asset carrying amount  the asset is written down to fair value 
fair value is based upon quoted market prices  if available 
when quoted market prices are not available  the company estimates fair value based upon the selling prices of similar assets or valuation techniques 
the company must estimate the net cash inflows to assess an asset or asset group carrying amount and fair value 
estimates are based upon internal budgets and forecasts 
a change in the utilization of the assets or a decision to exit certain product lines or manufacturing locations could impact the company s estimate of future cash flows 
a decrease in estimated future cash flows could reduce the fair values of long lived assets  increasing the likelihood of impairment  which could have a significant impact on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position 
the company is required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carry amount 
the company has elected to perform the annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment as of september of each year 
the company identifies potential goodwill impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting segment with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the company determines fair value using a discounted cash flow and market multiple approach 
if the fair value of a reporting segment exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting segment is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of a segment exceeds its fair value  the amount of goodwill impairment loss  if any  must be measured 
the company measures the amount of goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of reporting segment goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting segment goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized as an operating expense 
warranty and defective returns the company s air conditioner products are covered by standard product warranty plans that extend from to years 
in addition  major retailers have consumer return policies which allow consumers the ability to return product that may be defective in lieu of field service 
upon return to the company  these units are inspected  repaired as required  reboxed and held for future sale as factory reconditioned products 
a portion of those units returned is not repairable 
at the time revenue is recognized  upon shipment  measurements of those sales are reduced by estimates of the future costs associated with fulfilling warranty obligations and for the expense associated with repairing or scrapping defective returns 
the company estimates warranty costs and defective returns utilizing historical failure and defective return rates  which may or may not be indicative of future rates 
the estimate for warranty obligations and defective returns is a critical accounting estimate for the hvacr segment 
over the past years  warranty and defective return costs represented approximately of sales for the hvacr segment 
each quarter  the estimate of warranty and defective return obligations  including the assumptions about estimated failure and return rates  is reevaluated 
the company has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of its board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in this md a
