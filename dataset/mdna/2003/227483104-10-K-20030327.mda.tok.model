item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial and other data and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
certain prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation 
overview we are one of the largest providers of healthcare staffing services in the united states 
our healthcare staffing business segment  which represents approximately of our revenue  is comprised of travel nurse and allied health staffing  per diem nurse staffing and clinical research trials staffing 
approximately of our revenue is derived from travel nurse staffing services 
our other staffing services include the placement of allied healthcare professionals  such as radiology technicians  rehabilitation therapists and respiratory therapists  and the placement of clinical research professionals 
our other human capital management services business segment  which represents approximately of our revenues  consists of education and training  healthcare consulting  and physician search services 
for the year ended december   our revenue and income before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization  non recurring secondary offering costs and non recurring indirect transaction costs as shown on the consolidated statement of operations adjusted ebitda were million and million  respectively 
history in july  an affiliate of charterhouse group international  inc and certain members of management acquired the assets of cross country staffing  our predecessor  from w 
r 
grace co 
upon the closing of this transaction  we changed from a partnership to a c corporation form of ownership 
in december  we acquired travcorps corporation travcorps  which was owned by investment funds managed by morgan stanley private equity and certain members of travcorps management and subsequently changed our name to cross country travcorps  inc in may  we changed our name to cross country  inc revenue our travel and per diem nurse staffing revenue is received primarily from acute care hospitals 
our clinical trials staffing revenue is received primarily from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as medical device manufacturers 
revenue from allied health staffing services is received from numerous sources  including providers of radiation  rehabilitation and respiratory services at hospitals  nursing homes  sports medicine clinics and schools 
revenue from our search and recruitment  consulting and education and training services is received from numerous sources  including hospitals  physician group practices  insurance companies and individual healthcare professionals 
our fees are paid directly by our clients rather than by government or other third party payors 
during  we adopted the provisions of the financial accounting standard board s fasb emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
this eitf requires that reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses should be characterized as revenue and a corresponding expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
prior to the adoption of this eitf  we reflected the reimbursement of out of pocket expenses as an offsetting reduction to direct operating expenses and selling  general  and administrative expenses 
accordingly  we have adjusted all periods reported to reflect an increase in revenue  and an equal and offsetting increase in expenses  related to reimbursable expenses 
this change in classification has not had an effect on current or previously reported net income  or net income per share 
revenue is recognized when services are rendered 
accordingly  accounts receivable includes an accrual for employees time worked but not yet invoiced 
similarly  accrued compensation includes an accrual for employees time worked but not yet paid 
each of our field employees on travel assignment works for us under a contract 
these contracts typically last weeks 
payroll contract employees are hourly employees whose contract specifies the hourly rate they will be paid  including applicable overtime  and any other benefits they are entitled to receive during the contract period 
for payroll contract employees  we bill clients at an hourly rate and assume all employee costs  including payroll  withholding taxes  benefits and professional liability insurance and occupational safety and health administration  or osha  requirements  as well as any travel and housing arrangements 
mobile contract employees are hourly employees of the hospital client and receive an agreement that specifies the hourly rates they will be paid by the hospital employer  as well as any benefits they are entitled to receive from us 
for mobile contract employees  we provide recruitment  housing in apartments leased by us and travel reimbursement 
our contract with the healthcare professional obligates us to provide these services to the healthcare professional 
we are compensated for the services we provide at a predetermined rate negotiated with our hospital client  without regard to the our cost of providing these services 
currently  approximately of our employees work under payroll contracts 
our healthcare staffing revenue and earnings are impacted by the relative supply of and demand for nurses at healthcare facilities 
we rely significantly on our ability to recruit and retain nurses and other healthcare personnel who possess the skills  experience and  as required  licensure necessary to meet the specified requirements of our clients 
shortages of qualified nurses and other healthcare personnel could limit our ability to fill open assignments and grow our revenue and net income 
the relative demand for our services at client s facilities may also affect the profitability of our business 
of late  many hospitals have taken nurse staffing actions that have decreased demand  which we believe has temporarily slowed our rate of revenue growth during the later part of we believe these decisions have resulted in increased reliance on staff nurse overtime  increased patient to nurse ratios and high wage and compensation increases  including sign on bonuses  by the hospitals 
we also believe that  due to present economic conditions  where many nurse s spouses have been laid off and severance and unemployment benefits have ended  many part time nurses employed directly by hospitals who would have typically worked two shifts or less per week have increased the number of shifts worked at their hospitals  and are doing so at the prevailing hospital wage 
other factors that affect the demand for our services are patient occupancy rates 
as occupancy increases  temporary employees are often added before full time employees are hired 
as occupancy decreases  clients tend to reduce their use of temporary employees before undertaking layoffs of their regular employees 
additionally  we may experience more competitive pricing pressure during these periods of decreased demand 
acquisitions the following table provides certain information relating to our acquisitions to date acquired business acquisition date primary services purchase price a potential earnout earnout earned to date jennings  ryan kolb  inc march healthcare management consulting services million million over months million novapro january nurse staffing million gill balsano consulting  llc

the travcorps acquisition price represents the approximate value of our common stock that was exchanged for all the outstanding shares of travcorps million  plus the assumption of million of debt 
b due to the discontinuance of the e staff business we do not expect additional earnout payments to be made 
discontinued operations in march  we committed to a formal plan to dispose of our subsidiary  e staff  through a sale of this business 
e staff was previously included in our other human capital management services segment 
e staff is an application service provider that has developed an internet subscription based communication  scheduling  credentialing and training service business for healthcare providers 
as an application service provider  e staff maintains a database of the client s employees on e staff s servers  and prospective e staff clients were concerned about placing their health care employees names and credentials on servers owned or controlled by one of the nation s largest healthcare staffing companies 
accordingly  we decided to sell this subsidiary 
pursuant to fasb statement no 
 our consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to reflect the discontinuance of e staff 
the costs and expenses  assets and liabilities of e staff have been segregated and reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations 
in december  we committed to a formal plan to divest hospitalhub  inc  or hospitalhub  our electronic job board business  which began operations in the operating results of hospitalhub have been accounted for as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and in the other financial information included herein 
we completed the divestiture of hospitalhub in the second quarter of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets from the acquisition of the assets of our predecessor  cross country staffing  a partnership  and from subsequent acquisitions were million and million  respectively  at december  we adopted the provisions of fasb no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  as of january  accordingly  goodwill and certain other identifiable intangible assets are no longer subject to amortization 
instead  we review impairment annually 
other identifiable intangible assets  which are subject to amortization  are being amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
goodwill and other intangible assets represented of our stockholders equity as of december  the amount of definite lived intangible assets amortized equaled of our income from operations for the year ended december  results of operations the following table summarizes  for the periods indicated  selected statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenue year ended december  revenue from services direct operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses bad debt expense adjusted ebitda a depreciation and amortization non recurring secondary offering and indirect transaction costs income from operations interest expense  net income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes loss on disposal of discontinued operations  net of income taxes net income before extraordinary item extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt net income a we define adjusted ebitda as income before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization  non recurring secondary offering costs and non recurring indirect transaction costs 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
items excluded from adjusted ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance 
adjusted ebitda is a key measure used by management to evaluate our operations and provide useful information to investors 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income  cash flows generated by operations  investing or financing activities  or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity 
because adjusted ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  adjusted ebitda as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
segment information the following table presents  for the periods indicated  selected statement of operations data by segment year ended december  dollars in thousands revenue a healthcare staffing    other human capital management services    contribution income b healthcare staffing    other human capital management services    unallocated corporate overhead    adjusted ebitda    a we adopted eitf issue no 
 which states that reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses should be characterized as revenue in the income statement 
this required certain reclassifications of our revenue  cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses 
this change has been reflected in all periods presented 
b we define contribution income as earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and corporate expenses not specifically identified to a reporting segment 
during the year ended december  we refined our methodology for allocating corporate overhead expenses to our segments to more accurately reflect the profitability of each segment 
certain prior year segment data has been reclassified to reflect this improvement in the allocation methodology 
segment information for was not reclassified as it would not have provided meaningful comparisons 
this change in the allocation of overhead expenses does not impact prior year consolidated financial statements 
additionally  e staff  which was previously included in other human capital management services  has been included in discontinued operations

the increase was attributable to a higher average hourly bill rate in all businesses and an increase in the numbers of field employees in our nurse staffing and allied health staffing businesses  offset in part by a modest reduction in the hours billed per fte per week 
the average number of hours worked per week per fte continued to decrease in primarily as a result of an increase in the number of nurses working three hour shifts rather than five hour shifts

fasb statement no 
promulgates that goodwill and certain intangible assets that have indefinite lives should not be amortized

part of the increase in accounts receivable was related to acquisitions 
excluding acquisitions  accounts receivable increased million  however  days sales outstanding was days at december   down from days at december  this reduction was due to improved collections

subsequent to the repayment  the scheduled maturities of the term loan  in thousands  are   and critical accounting principles and estimates in response to the securities and exchange commission s release number cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies and number commission statement about management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to asset impairment  accruals for insurance  allowance for doubtful accounts  and contingencies and litigation 
we state our accounting policies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended december   contained herein 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we have recorded goodwill and intangibles resulting from our acquisitions through december  through december   goodwill and other intangibles were amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of to years 
upon the adoption of fasb statement no 
on january   we ceased amortizing goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives and performed a transitional impairment analysis as of january   to assess the recoverability of these intangibles  in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
we also completed the annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of based on the results of these tests  we determined that there was no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  or december  the calculation of fair value used in these impairment assessments included a number of estimates and assumptions  including projections of future income and cash flows  the identification of appropriate market multiples and the choice of an appropriate discount rate 
if we are required to record an impairment charge in the future  it could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we periodically evaluate the recovery of the carrying amount of net assets from discontinued operations to determine if the net assets are impaired 
this evaluation can also be triggered by various indicators of impairment  including factors  which could cause the estimated discounted cash flows to be less than the carrying amount of net assets 
during the year ended december   an impairment charge of approximately million net of income tax benefit of million  was taken on the net assets of e staff and is included in our consolidated statement of operations as loss from discontinued operations 
at december   fair value was based on the latest offer received for the sale of e staff and included the estimated cash flows from the sale to a potential buyer  adjusted for the estimated probability of the sale 
any further impairment would be immaterial 
we maintain accruals for our health  workers compensation and professional liability policies that are partially self insured and are classified in accrued employee compensation and benefits in our consolidated balance sheets 
we determine the adequacy of these accruals by periodically evaluating our historical experience and trends related to health  workers compensation  and professional liability claims and payments  based on actuarial computations and industry experience and trends 
if such information indicates that our accruals are overstated or understated  we will reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which results in a provision for bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables  considering the customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
some of these matters include professional liability and employee related matters 
our hospital and healthcare facility clients may also become subject to claims  governmental inquiries and investigations and legal actions to which we may become a party relating to services provided by our professionals 
from time to time  and depending upon the particular facts and circumstances  we may be subject to indemnification obligations under our contracts with our hospital and healthcare facility clients relating to these matters 
although we are currently not aware of any such pending or threatened litigation that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us  if we become aware of such claims against us  we will evaluate the probability of an adverse outcome and provide accruals for such contingencies as necessary 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we adopted the provisions of fasb statement no 
 as of january  fasb statement no 
further clarifies the criteria to recognize intangible assets separately from goodwill and promulgates that goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite lives not be amortized 
instead  these assets are reviewed for impairment annually with any related losses recognized in earnings when incurred 
other identifiable intangible assets continue to be amortized  under the provisions of this statement  using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
in august  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we adopted the provisions of fasb statement no 
as of january  in accordance with this statement  long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we periodically review long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets  to determine if any impairment exists based upon projected  undiscounted net cash flows of the company 
recoverability of intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to net future cash flows expected to be generated from the asset 
at december  and  we believe that no impairment of long lived assets or identifiable intangible assets exists 
in april  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 rescission of statements   and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
this statement rescinds fasb statement no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  and an amendment of that statement  fasb statement no

 accounting for intangible assets of motor carriers 
this statement amends fasb statement no

this statement also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions

requires that a liability for a cost that is associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
it nullifies the guidance in eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
under eitf  an entity recognized a liability for an exit cost on the date that the entity committed itself to an exit plan 
under fasb statement no 
 an entity s commitment to a plan does not  by itself  create a present obligation to other parties that meets the definition of a liability 
fasb statement no 
will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we have not adopted the provisions of fasb statement no 
in the december  financial statements  or for any prior periods 
the adoption of fasb statement no 
is expected to impact the timing of recognition of costs associated with future exit and disposal activities

 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
fasb statement no 
amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
further  the statement requires disclosure of comparable information for all companies regardless of whether  when  or how an entity adopts the preferable  fair value based method of accounting 
these disclosures are now required for interim periods in addition to the traditional annual disclosure 
fasb statement no 
is effective for fiscal periods ending after december  we have adopted the additional disclosure requirements as of december  inflation during the last several years  the rate of inflation in healthcare related services has exceeded that of the economy as a whole 
this inflation has increased our direct operating costs 
we are also impacted by fluctuations in housing costs and recently by increases in costs of professional  general and healthcare insurance 
historically  we have been able to recoup the negative impact of such fluctuations by increasing our billing rates 
we may not be able to continue increasing our billing rates and increases in our direct operating costs may adversely affect us in the future 
in addition  our clients are impacted by payments of healthcare benefits by federal and state governments as well as private insurers

we are party to an interest rate swap agreement  which fixes the interest rate paid on million of borrowings under our credit facility at plus the applicable margin 
the last swap payment was made in february prior to january  we accounted for the swap agreement as a hedge  which means changes in the fair value of the swap were not required to be recognized in earnings

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
upon adopting fasb statement no 
 we recorded a liability for the fair value of the swap  which reduced consolidated stockholders equity by million 
we recognized changes in the fair value of the swap in earnings to the extent such changes were greater or less than the corresponding change in the fair value of the future variable interest payments on the portion of the debt underlying the swap 
during the year ended december   other comprehensive income increased by million as a result of this interest rate swap 
the fair value of our interest rate swap at december  was million and is separately stated in our consolidated balance sheets 
changes in interest rates  which result in a yield curve that is different from those projected  may cause changes in the fair value of the swap 
a change in interest rates on variable rate debt would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating approximately million for and million for and
