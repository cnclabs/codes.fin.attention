item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading biotechnology company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of high quality oncology products that both extend life and improve the quality of life for cancer patients worldwide 
we have established a balanced pipeline of oncology drug candidates that includes both novel mechanism based  targeted therapies in the areas of signal transduction and apoptosis and next generation cytotoxic chemotherapy agents 
we also market two products novantrone r and gelclair r 
we acquired the rights to market and promote novantrone r mitoxantrone concentrate for injection for approved oncology indications in the united states and to market and distribute gelclair r bioadherent oral gel in north america during fiscal our most prominent drug candidate  tarceva tm erlotinib hc  is a small molecule inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor  or her egfr 
the protein product of the her egfr gene is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is over expressed or mutated in many major solid tumors including lung and pancreatic cancers 
the her egfr gene is also amplified in certain tumors including glioblastoma multiforme  an aggressive form of brain cancer 
we believe her egfr inhibitors represent an exciting new class of relatively safe and well tolerated anti cancer agents that may have utility in treating a wide range of cancer patients 
tarceva tm is an oral once a day small molecule drug designed to specifically block the activity of the her egfr protein 
currently  we are developing tarceva tm in a global alliance with genentech  inc and roche 
if the drug receives regulatory approval  genentech will lead the marketing effort in the united states and roche will market the drug in the rest of the world 
we will receive milestone payments from both genentech and roche  an equal profit share from us sales  and royalties on sales outside of the united states 
tarceva tm has demonstrated encouraging indications of anti cancer activity in single agent  open label phase i and phase ii trials in non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc  bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma  or bac a form of lung cancer  glioblastoma multiforme  head and neck cancer and ovarian cancer 
based upon these data  the alliance embarked upon a comprehensive global development plan in designed to both register tarceva tm and maintain a competitive position against other egfr inhibitors 
in october  we announced that two tarceva tm phase iii clinical trials for front line nsclc in combination with conventional chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone did not meet their primary endpoints of improving overall survival 
we had considered these trials high risk as a result of a competitor s previously announced failure of its egfr inhibitor in this setting which had demonstrated that combining an egfr inhibitor concomitantly with conventional chemotherapy drug regimens did not result in improved patient benefit 
tarceva tm is currently in a fully enrolled patient phase iii clinical trial for second third line nsclc patients  which is our primary registration study 
this study compares the use of tarceva tm as a monotherapy versus placebo in lung cancer patients who have failed conventional chemotherapy treatments 
the study is designed to detect a survival advantage as its primary endpoint with secondary endpoints that include symptom relief and improvement of quality of life 
based on encouraging data from a phase i study in glioblastoma  our partner  genentech  initiated a phase ii program for this indication in august tarceva tm is also in a phase iii trial for pancreatic cancer where it is being tested in combination with gemcitabine versus gemcitabine plus placebo 
we expect top line data for the ongoing phase iii trials and phase ii glioblastoma trial during we estimate the approval of tarceva tm by the us food and drug administration in the fourth quarter of calendar if the second third line nsclc study successfully meets its endpoint 
we believe that tarceva tm has established a corporate presence for us in the oncology field 
our strategy over the last several years has been designed to capitalize upon this presence and to direct our business towards becoming a world class oncology organization 
to this end  we have raised capital  formed alliances and engaged in merger and acquisition activity with the strategic intent to support and enable the successful development  registration and commercialization of tarceva tm by reducing program execution and registration risk and by maximizing tarceva tm s differentiation and competitive positioning  and establish a first class oncology franchise around tarceva tm by assembling  through mergers  acquisitions and internal growth  a full complement of capabilities and technology and a diversified risk balanced portfolio and pipeline of drug candidates 
behind tarceva tm  we have multiple drug candidates in clinical development 
osi l  the most promising of our next generation cytotoxic chemotherapy candidates  is a liposomal formulation of a thymidylate synthase inhibitor 
it is being developed as a potential competitor to fluorouracil  or fu and capecitabine xeloda r 
osi l is in a phase ii program which includes a phase ii trial in gastric and gastric esophageal junction cancers and combination phase i trials with cisplatin platinol r and oxaliplatin eloxatin tm 
aptosyn r exisulind was added to our pipeline with the acquisition of cell pathways  inc in june and is currently in a phase iii trial in combination with docetaxel taxotere r for the treatment of advanced nsclc 
although cell pathways had advanced aptosyn r to phase iii trials  we consider it to be a higher risk prototype drug candidate arising from the apoptosis platform acquired from cell pathways 
we believe osi formerly cp  the second drug candidate acquired from cell pathways to be a more promising second generation molecule that is currently being evaluated in a dose ranging phase i study and a series of exploratory phase ii studies in chronic lymphocytic leukemia  renal cell carcinoma and prostate cancer 
osi and osi are two additional next generation cytotoxic agents currently undergoing phase ii and phase i trials  respectively 
final data from the on going phase i and phase ii studies is expected from both programs during the coming year 
we currently view the continued development of these two candidates beyond these studies to be unlikely 
three molecules  cp  targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor  or vegfr  gene  cp  targeting the her gene and cp  targeting the platelet derived growth factor receptor  or pdgfr  gene that were discovered as part of our historical alliance with pfizer inc and are currently in clinical trials conducted by pfizer 
we will receive royalty payments on the pfizer candidates if they are successfully commercialized 
key transactions in fiscal we have carried out three major transactions in fiscal in keeping with our strategy of building an oncology franchise around tarceva tm  maintaining a strong cash position as we do so and assembling a commercial operation in the united states ahead of tarceva tm s projected launch 
on march   we entered into an agreement to market and promote the drug novantrone r for approved oncology indications in the united states pursuant to the terms of a co promotion agreement with ares tradings  sa  an affiliate of serono sa in consideration for exclusive marketing and promotion rights  we paid million in cash 
in consideration for certain transition services provided by serono during a four month transition period starting on the effective date of the agreement  we also paid a one time fee of million 
under the terms of the agreement  we pay quarterly maintenance fees to serono until the later of the expiration of the last valid patent claim or the first generic date 
we receive commissions on net sales of novantrone r in the united states for oncology indications 
these commission rates increase upon the achievement of certain annual sales goals for novantrone r in oncology indications 
novantrone r is approved by the fda for the treatment of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia  which includes myelogenous  promyelocytic  monocytic and erythroid acute leukemias  and the relief of pain associated with advanced hormone refractory prostate cancer 
the drug is also approved for certain advanced forms of multiple sclerosis 
serono will continue to market novantrone r in the multiple sclerosis indications and will record all us sales in all indications 
we initiated our sales activity for novantrone r during the third quarter of fiscal on june   we completed our acquisition of cell pathways 
cell pathways was a development stage biotechnology company focused on the research and development of products to treat and prevent cancer  and the future commercialization of such products 
cell pathways also marketed and sold gelclair r  the manufacturing rights and obligations of which were held by sinclair pharmaceuticals ltd 
of the united kingdom and subsequently licensed to helsinn healthcare sa in july the assets purchased and liabilities assumed by us included a two drug candidates in clinical development aptosyn r and osi and the related technology platform and patent estate  b exclusive distribution rights to gelclair r  a marketed oncology device  c inventory  d rights to cell pathways leased facility in horsham  pennsylvania  as well as leasehold improvements and certain equipment  and e certain other assets and liabilities 
as consideration for the merger  each share of cell pathways common stock was exchanged for i shares of osi common stock and ii a contingent value right to receive shares of osi common stock 
the contingent value right is triggered in the event a new drug application is accepted for filing with the us food and drug administration by june  for either of the two newly acquired clinical candidates  aptosyn r or osi based on the exchange ratio of  we issued approximately million shares of osi common stock to cell pathways stockholders in connection with the merger 
on september   we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes in a private placement for net proceeds of million 
on september   the bankers associated with this convertible debt offering exercised an option to purchase an additional million of notes  for additional net proceeds of million 
the notes bear interest at per annum  payable semi annually  and mature on september  the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
we used million of the net proceeds for the purchase of  shares of our common stock and million to acquire us government securities that were pledged to the trustee as security for the notes in an amount sufficient to pay the first six interest payments on the notes 
we are planning to use the remainder of the proceeds from the sale of the notes for the continued development of our oncology franchise which may include additional product or corporate acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
to support novantrone r  we have built a core commercial operation comprising of approximately sales  marketing  medical affairs  commercial planning and other support personnel including an approximately person sales force 
we believe that the tangible and intangible benefits of this commercial capability are significant in that it allows us to pursue additional in licensing and co promotion arrangements for other marketed products  enables us to directly market our future pipeline products in the united states  and further validates osi as a quality development and commercialization partner for oncology development candidates 
in addition  it allows us to pursue our co promotion rights for tarceva tm in the united states with our partner  genentech 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and which require our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition sales commissions represent the commissions earned on sales of novantrone r for oncology uses pursuant to the co promotion agreement with serono 
serono will continue to market novantrone r for multiple sclerosis indications and will record all us sales for all indications  including oncology indications 
sales commissions from novantrone r on net oncology sales are recognized in the period the sales occur based on the estimated split between oncology sales and multiple sclerosis sales of novantrone r  as determined on a quarterly basis by an external third party 
the split between oncology and multiple sclerosis sales is subject to further adjustment based on final review by the external party  in the subsequent quarter 
management does not believe these adjustments  if any  will be significant to the consolidated financial statements 
product sales represent revenues earned on sales of gelclair r 
the marketing and distribution rights to gelclair r were acquired in our acquisition of cell pathways effective june  in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  given the limited sales history of gelclair r  we at this time defer the recognition of revenue on product shipments of gelclair r to wholesale customers until such time as the product is sold from the wholesale customer to the retail and non retail outlets 
for each reporting period  we monitor shipments from wholesale customers to pharmacies and hospitals and wholesale customer reorder history based on data from an external third party 
we recognize all nonrefundable upfront license fees  including upfront technology access fees  as revenue over the term of the related research collaboration period in accordance with the guidance provided in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended 
our most significant application of this policy  to date  is the million in upfront fees received from genentech and roche in january  which were originally being recognized evenly over the expected three year term of our required research and development efforts under the terms of the agreement 
the expected term is subject to change based upon the parties continuous monitoring of current research data and their projections for the remaining development period 
a change in this expected term impacts the period over which the remaining deferred revenue would be recognized 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the expected term was changed from three years to four years to reflect the revised estimated timing of our research and development commitment for tarceva tm under the alliance 
the revision was a result of the review of the current research data available  current developments in the her egfr targeted therapy market and the involved parties revised projections for the clinical development plan 
as a result of this revision  we recorded revenues of million for fiscal  compared to million had the upfront fees continued to be recognized over the three year period 
collaborative program revenues represent funding arrangements for research and development in the field of biotechnology and are recognized when earned in accordance with the terms of the contracts and the related development activities undertaken 
accruals for clinical research organization and clinical site costs we make estimates of costs incurred to date but not yet invoiced in relation to external clinical research organizations  or cros  and clinical site costs 
we analyze the progress of clinical trials  including levels of patient enrollment  invoices received and contracted costs when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liabilities 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in determining the accrued balance in any accounting period 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets effective october   we fully adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and certain other intangibles with indefinite useful lives  are not amortized into results of operations but instead are reviewed for impairment at least annually and written down  and charged to results of operations in periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain other intangibles is more than their implied fair value 
we completed our impairment review of goodwill during the first quarter of fiscal and determined that no impairment charge was required upon adoption 
in addition  no indications of impairment were identified during the fiscal year ended september our identifiable intangible assets are subject to amortization 
we reassessed the useful life of our intangible assets upon adoption of sfas no 
to make any necessary amortization period adjustments to our then existing intangible assets 
no adjustments resulted from this assessment 
sfas no 
requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived asset to be disposed of 
under sfas no 
 intangible and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
as a result of our acquisition of the exclusive rights to market and promote novantrone r for the approved oncology indications in the united states  we recorded an identifiable intangible asset with an estimated useful life through the expiration of the novantrone r patent in april in connection with our acquisition of cell pathways  we assumed the exclusive rights to market and distribute gelclair r in north america which cell pathways had acquired from sinclair in january for a period of years 
as a result  we recorded an identifiable intangible asset which is being amortized over eight and a half years  the remaining term of the agreement 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets on october   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires  among other things  that long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
intangibles with determinable lives and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on historical and projected future operating results  changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our overall business strategy  and market and economic trends 
in the future  events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain intangibles with determinable lives and other long lived assets are impaired which may result in an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended september  comparison of fiscal and fiscal results of operations our fiscal net loss of million decreased million compared to our fiscal net loss of million 
the fiscal loss included an in process r d charge of million in connection with the acquisition of cell pathways 
the fiscal loss included an in process r d charge of million in connection with the acquisition of gilead sciences  inc s oncology assets 
the increase in net loss excluding the in process r d charges was in part related to a one time fee and quarterly maintenance fees expended in connection with the novantrone r licensing agreement with serono  fees associated with the celgene corporation deal to acquire full north american marketing rights to gelclair r  the costs of scaling up and recruiting a commercial organization and increased amortization expense 
revenues total revenues for fiscal were million compared to revenues of million for fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily due to novantrone r sales commissions 
on march   we began recording novantrone r sales commissions  upon the execution of the co promotion agreement with serono 
total sales commissions for fiscal were million 
we launched our sales efforts for novantrone r during the third quarter of fiscal we project that our total fiscal sales commissions on novantrone r oncology sales will be in excess of million 
however  congress has recently passed legislation  subject to the president s approval which is expected  that materially changes the medicare reimbursement guidelines for intravenous and oral oncology products which may impact the sales revenues of all intravenous chemotherapy agents 
we began recognizing gelclair r product sales on june   upon the closing of our acquisition of cell pathways 
total product sales for the period june  to september  were  we launched our sales effort for this product in october we estimate that our total fiscal product sales of gelclair r will be between million to million 
license and other revenues decreased million or for fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the amount of revenue recognized relating to the million upfront fees received from genentech and roche see note a to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with the provisions of sab no 
 we were recognizing the million received from genentech and roche evenly over the expected three year development phase of our agreement 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we changed the expected term of the agreement from three years to four years to reflect the revised estimated timing of our research and development commitment for tarceva tm under the alliance 
the revision was a result of the review of the current research data available  current developments in the her egfr targeted therapy market and the involved parties revised projections for the clinical development plan 
in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes  the remaining unearned revenue is being recognized prospectively over the revised term 
as a result  we recorded revenues of million during fiscal compared to revenues of million during fiscal the decrease in fiscal was also due to a decrease in revenues of  related to certain administrative services provided to british biotech plc and gilead during the transition periods following the acquisitions of certain assets of each company in fiscal total collaborative program revenues decreased million or for fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the phase down of our collaboration in cosmeceuticals with anaderm research corporation 
in july  we entered into an agreement with pfizer to accelerate the phase down period of the collaboration with anaderm so that it would terminate no later than april  in consideration for the work performed by us during the accelerated phase down period  we received million in september and million in march upon the successful completion of the transition period 
the million was recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the transition period and the million was recognized during the second quarter of fiscal upon the successful completion of the transition 
the decrease for the year was also due to a decrease in activity related to our collaboration in diabetes with tanabe seiyaku co  ltd  which expired in october and was not renewed 
as a result of our strategic decision to divest all non oncology research programs  as well as the completion of the anaderm and tanabe collaborations in fiscal  we no longer expect collaborative revenues from research alliances going forward 
expenses total operating expenses of million decreased million or for fiscal compared to operating expenses of million for fiscal excluding the acquired in process r d charges of million and million recorded in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  operating expenses increased million or for fiscal these in process r d charges related to the acquisition of cell pathways in june and the acquisition of certain assets from gilead in december we do not deem these charges to be indicative of the day to day operations of our company 
operating expenses recognized in fiscal and primarily included i research and development expenses  which included expenses related to the development of our lead clinical candidate  tarceva tm and our other clinical candidates  and proprietary and collaborative based research  ii in process r d charges related to the acquisition of cell pathways in june and the acquisition of oncology assets acquired from gilead in december  iii selling  general and administrative expenses  and iv amortization of intangibles 
cost of products sold related to sales of gelclair r were  for the period june  to september   or of product sales 
there were no costs of products sold prior to june  since we acquired the rights to gelclair r on june  in connection with the cell pathways acquisition 
the largest component of our total expenses  excluding the in process r d charges  is our ongoing investments in research and development  and particularly  the clinical development of our product pipeline 
we currently have multiple drug candidates in clinical development including our most prominent candidate  tarceva tm  which is currently in phase iii trials for nsclc and pancreatic cancer  phase ii trials for glioblastoma  and various other phase i and ii trials 
the other drug candidates are in various stages of clinical development 
aptosyn r was added to our pipeline with the acquisition of cell pathways and is currently in phase iii trials 
osi  which was acquired along with aptosyn r in connection with our acquisition of cell pathways  is a second generation molecule that is being evaluated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia  renal cell carcinoma and prostate cancer 
three candidates osi l  osi and osi are next generation cytotoxic chemotherapy agents  which we are developing 
three other candidates cp  cp  and cp  are gene targeted therapies currently being developed by pfizer and require no further research and development investment by us 
we consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline crucial to the long term approval process 
we manage our overall research  development and in licensing efforts in a manner designed to generate a constant flow of clinical candidates into development to offset both the advancement of products to the market and the anticipated attrition rate of drug candidates that fail in clinical trials or are terminated for business reasons 
the table below summarizes the typical duration of each phase of clinical development and the typical cumulative probabilities of success for approval of drug candidates entering clinical development 
the numbers are based upon industry survey data for small molecule drugs estimated cumulative development phase estimated completion time probability of success phase i years phase ii years phase iii years registration months the tufts center for the study of drug development estimates that the average cost to develop a new prescription drug is million 
the actual probability of success for each drug candidate and clinical program will be impacted by a variety of factors  including the quality of the molecule  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition and commercial viability 
because we manage our pipeline in a dynamic manner  it is difficult to give accurate guidance on the anticipated proportion of our research and development investments assigned to any one program prior to the phase iii stage of development  as well as the future cash inflows from these programs 
in fiscal  we invested a total of approximately million in research and approximately million in pre clinical and clinical development 
we consider this level of investment suitable to sustain one major phase iii program and two to four earlier clinical stage programs at any time and we manage our overall research and development investments toward this level of activity 
research and development expenses marginally increased by  in fiscal compared to fiscal increases in costs associated with the clinical development of tarceva tm and transition costs associated with the assimilation of cell pathways were offset by a shift from non oncology and collaborative programs to oncology programs 
also included in research and development expenses for fiscal was a severance charge of  this charge related to a reduction in our headcount in october as we refocused our business on oncology and away from services that we had historically provided to our former collaborative partners 
our most advanced development program is for tarceva tm 
in january  we entered into the alliance with genentech and roche for the global development and commercialization of tarceva tm 
the significant perceived market potential for tarceva tm has resulted in the alliance partnership committing to an unusually large and comprehensive global development plan for the candidate 
the global development plan comprises of major phase iii clinical trials in lung and pancreatic cancers and a large number of earlier stage trials in a variety of disease settings  including glioblastoma 
in addition  numerous collaborative and investigator sponsored studies are ongoing in a number of other disease settings including bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma and gynecological malignancies 
the alliance partners have committed to invest a combined million in the global development plan to be shared equally by the three parties 
additional research and development investments can be made by the parties outside of the global development plan with the consent of the other parties 
we estimate that we will invest an additional million in tarceva tm research and development outside of the global development plan prior to the drug s targeted fda approval in the fourth quarter of calendar as of september   we have invested in excess of million  representing our share of the costs incurred to date in the tripartite global development plan and additional investments outside the plan 
our research and development expenses for tarceva tm incurred for fiscal were million 
we anticipate investing a majority of the remaining million we have provisionally budgeted for this program over the next two years 
should tarceva tm be successfully registered and launched  we would anticipate continued research and development investment in the product to support its commercial growth 
for our second phase iii clinical candidate  aptosyn r  we expect the cost to complete the phase iii trials to be between and million as of september  in connection with the acquisition of cell pathways in june  we recorded an in process r d charge of million  representing the estimated fair value of the acquired in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use see note a to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the in process r d charge was assigned to the two development projects and their related technology platform and patent estates for aptosyn r million and osi million  based on their value on the date of the acquisition 
in determining the value of the in process r d  the assumed commercialization dates for these products ranged from to significant assumptions and estimates used in the valuation of in process r d included the stage of development for each of the two projects  future revenues  growth rates for each product  product sales cycles  the estimated life of a product s underlying technology  future operating expenses  probability adjustments to reflect the risk of developing the acquired technology into commercially viable products  and a discount rate of to reflect present value 
in connection with the acquisition of certain assets from gilead in december  we recorded an in process r d charge of million during fiscal  representing the estimated fair value of the acquired in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use see note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the in process r d was allocated to three oncology candidates acquired osi l  osi and osi the value of the acquired in process r d charges were determined by estimating the projected net cash flows related to products under development based upon the future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of such products 
given the risks associated with the development of new drugs  the revenue and expense forecasts were probability adjusted to reflect the risk of advancement through the approval process 
the applied risk adjustments were based on each compound s stage of development at the time of assessment and the historical probability of successful advancement for compounds at that stage 
these modeled cash flows were discounted back to their net present value 
the projected net cash flows from such projects were based on management s estimates of revenues and operating profits related to such projects 
the in process r d was valued based on the income approach that focuses on the income producing capability of the assets 
the underlying premise of this approach is that the value of an asset can be measured by the present worth of the net economic benefit cash receipts less cash outlays to be received over the life of the asset 
for each project  we need to successfully complete a series of clinical trials and to receive fda or other regulatory approvals prior to commercialization 
there can be no assurance that any of these candidates will ever reach feasibility or develop into products that can be marketed profitably  nor can there be any assurance that we will be able to develop and commercialize these products prior to the development of comparable products by our competitors 
if it is determined that it is not cost beneficial to pursue the further development of any of these candidates  we may discontinue such further development of certain or all of these candidates 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was due to i additional management and personnel relating to the establishment of commercial operations to support gelclair r and novantrone r  ii subcontracting expenses relating to our short term transitional arrangement with a contract sales organization comprising a core of sales representatives as we build our commercial operations  iii increased commercialization and marketing costs relating to tarceva tm which are shared with genentech in accordance with the terms of our collaboration with genentech  iv expenses for maintenance fees and transition support services provided by serono relating to novantrone r sales in oncology indications  and v expenses associated with the full recovery of rights to market and distribute gelclair r from celgene  as well as transition support services provided by celgene 
included in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal is a severance charge of  relating to a reduction in our headcount in october we expect selling  general and administrative costs to increase as we expand our commercial operations which include a sales force and an associated marketing and sales management infrastructure 
the sales and marketing infrastructure is comprised of approximately sales  marketing  medical affairs  commercial planning and support personnel  including an approximately person sales force 
amortization of intangibles increased million or for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase primarily related to million in amortization expense related to the exclusive rights to market and promote the drug novantrone r for approved oncology indications in the united states 
also included in amortization for fiscal is  in amortization expense related to the exclusive rights to market and distribute gelclair r in north america 
offsetting these increases was a million decrease in amortization expense from fiscal attributable to the full adoption of sfas no 
on october   whereby we ceased amortizing the assembled workforce acquired from british biotech and reclassified the balance of million to goodwill 
other income and expense net investment income decreased million or for fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average rate of return on our investments and to less funds available for investment during the respective periods 
interest expense increased million or for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to the interest expense incurred on the convertible senior subordinated notes 
in february  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes  which bear interest at per annum  are payable semi annually  and mature in february in august and september  we retired a total of million in principal amount of these notes 
in september  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes  which bear interest at per annum  are payable semi annually  and mature in september for fiscal  other expense net was  compared to other expense net of million for fiscal included in fiscal was the amortization of debt issuance costs of  offset by realized gains from the sale of investments of  included in fiscal was the amortization of debt issuance costs of  and a charge of  related to the writedown of our investment in a privately held healthcare information company see note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
with respect to the early retirement of the convertible senior subordinated notes in august and september  we recognized a net gain of million in fiscal representing the difference between the purchase price of million and the aggregate principal of million and related accrued interest less the writedown of million of related debt issuance costs see note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
also in fiscal  we recognized the million contingent payment received from the bayer corporation in december  in connection with the sale of the diagnostic business in november see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal results of operations our fiscal net loss of million increased million compared to our fiscal net loss of million 
the increase in the net loss was primarily related to the in process r d charge of million in connection with the acquisition of gilead s oncology assets 
the increase in the net loss  excluding the in process r d charge  is primarily due to an increase in development costs associated with tarceva tm and our three next generation cytotoxic chemotherapy agents acquired from gilead 
included in the net loss for fiscal was a non cash charge of million related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the recognition of upfront fees upon the adoption of sab no 
see note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
excluding the effect of this change in accounting principle  the net loss for fiscal would have been million or per share 
revenues total revenues for fiscal were million compared to revenues of million for fiscal license and other revenues increased million or for fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was due primarily to the recognition of the pro rata portion of the million upfront fees received from genentech and roche for months in fiscal compared to only nine months in fiscal see note a to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with the provisions of sab no 
 we were recognizing the million received from genentech and roche evenly over the expected three year development phase of our agreement 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we changed the expected term of the agreement to four years to reflect the revised estimated timing of our research and development commitment for tarceva tm under the alliance 
the revision was a result of the review of the current research data available  current developments in the her egfr targeted therapy market and the involved parties revised projections for the clinical development plan 
in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting change  the remaining deferred revenue will be recognized prospectively over the revised term 
as a result  we recorded revenues of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to million had we continued to recognize the upfront fees over a three year period 
the increase was also related to certain administrative services provided to provided to british biotech and gilead during the transition periods following the acquisitions of certain assets of each company in fiscal total collaborative program revenues decreased million in fiscal or compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the phase down of our collaboration with anaderm commencing in april and the conclusions of our funded collaborations with pfizer in april  sankyo co  ltd 
in december and solvay pharmaceuticals  inc in december in july  we entered into an agreement with pfizer to accelerate the phase down period of the collaboration with anaderm so that it would terminate no later than april  in consideration for the work to be performed by us during the accelerated phase down period  we received million in september and million in march upon the successful completion of the transition period 
the million was recognized as revenue ratably over the expected term of the transition period and the million was recognized during the second quarter of fiscal upon the successful completion of the transition 
for fiscal  we recognized million of revenue related to the phase down 
expenses total operating expenses of million increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal operating expenses primarily included i research and development expenses  which include expenses related to the development of our lead clinical candidate  tarceva tm  and proprietary and collaborative based research  ii the million charge related to the acquired in process r d related to the oncology assets acquired from gilead  iii selling  general and administrative expenses  and iv amortization of intangibles 
research and development expenses increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was related primarily to increased costs associated with i the clinical development of tarceva tm under our tripartite agreement with genentech and roche  ii increased investments in our proprietary cancer programs  including oncology candidates acquired from gilead in december  and iii increased investments in our core proprietary research programs and facilities 
these increases were slightly offset by a decrease in collaborative based research expenses  a reduction in certain stock option based compensation charges in comparison to the prior year  and a restructuring charge included in fiscal of approximately million 
this restructuring charge related to the closing of our tarrytown  new york and birmingham  england facilities  as further discussed below 
on august   the board of directors granted non qualified stock options to purchase up to  common shares to our then new president and head of research and development 
the terms of this grant provided for an option to purchase  shares of common stock with an exercise price equal to of the fair market value on the grant date vesting immediately upon his employment date on september  ie  the measurement date  and an option to purchase  shares of common stock with an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the grant date vesting one third in a year from the measurement date and monthly thereafter for twenty four months 
the granting of the  options resulted in deferred compensation of million as of september   which was to be recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 
a significant portion of this compensation expense was due to the high volatility of our common stock price between the grant date and the measurement date 
in fiscal   of compensation expense was included in r d expenses compared to million in fiscal as a result of his resignation as an employee effective february   no additional compensation expense has been recorded subsequent to february  and the remaining deferred compensation of million was reversed 
in addition  other stock options granted to non employees in connection with their consulting arrangements resulted in the recognition of  and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and deferred compensation of  and million as of september  and  respectively 
in connection with the acquisition of certain assets from gilead in fiscal  we recorded an in process r d charge of million representing the estimated fair value of the acquired in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use see note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flow from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value 
these cash flows were probability adjusted to take into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development and commercialization of the acquired in process technology 
the resulting net cash flows were based on estimated revenue  cost of sales  r d costs  selling  general and administrative costs  and the net cash flow reflects the assumptions that would be used by market participants 
in determining the value of the in process r d  the assumed commercialization dates for these products ranged from to we believe that the assumptions used in the valuation of purchased in process technology represented a reasonable estimate of the future benefits attributable to the purchased in process technology at the time of the acquisition 
no assurance can be given that actual results will not deviate from those assumptions in future periods 
the cumulative value of the r d projects we acquired from gilead was divided between the three principal projects  osi l phase i  osi phase ii and osi phase i 
value was assigned to each program million to osi l  million to osi  million to osi based on the assessment of estimated value at the date of acquisition 
the technological feasibility of these three projects had not yet been reached 
for each project  we need to successfully complete a series of clinical trials and to receive fda or other regulatory approvals prior to commercialization 
our estimates of the required investments for the overall development and registration for these next generation cytotoxic drugs range from to million per drug 
there can be no assurances that any of these projects will ever reach feasibility or develop into products that can be marketed profitably  nor can there be assurance we will be able to develop and commercialize these products prior to the development of comparable products by our competitors 
if it is determined that it is not cost beneficial to pursue the further development of any of these projects  we may discontinue such further development of certain or all of these projects 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the increased expenses for additional management and administrative personnel and consultants  as well as an increase in facility and information technology expenses and other professional fees associated with our expansion  corporate development and governance activities 
the increase was also due to increased commercialization and marketing costs relating to tarceva tm which are shared with genentech in accordance with the osi genentech agreement 
consulting expenses include stock options granted to non r d consultants in connection with their consulting arrangements which resulted in  in compensation expenses in fiscal compared to  in fiscal during fiscal  we made the strategic decision to i close our birmingham  england facility and relocate our birmingham personnel to our new oxford  england facilities as a result of the acquisition of assets from british biotech  and ii close our tarrytown  new york facility and relocate the tarrytown  new york personnel to our new research facility in farmingdale  new york 
the estimated cost of closing these facilities of million was accrued as of september   of which million was included in r d expenses and  in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal included in the closing costs were amounts associated with severance for employees who would not be relocated  the lease cost from the anticipated closing date through the lease termination date and the value of related leasehold improvements and other capital items which were not being relocated 
amortization of intangibles of million were primarily related to the amortization of the capitalized workforce and library license acquired from british biotech in september other income and expense net investment income decreased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average rate of return on our investments and to less funds available for investment 
interest expense increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the interest expense incurred on the convertible senior subordinated notes issued in february see note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  a portion of which were retired in august and september the convertible senior subordinated notes bear interest at per annum  payable semi annually  and mature on february  for fiscal and  other expenses net were approximately million and  respectively 
included in fiscal was the amortization of debt issuance costs of  and a charge of  related to the writedown of our investment in a privately owned healthcare information company see note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
with respect to the early retirement of these notes  we recognized a net gain of million in fiscal representing the difference between the purchase price of million and the aggregate principal of million and related accrued interest less the writedown of million of related debt issuance costs see note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
also in fiscal  we recognized the million contingent payment received from the bayer corporation in december  in connection with the sale of the diagnostic business in november see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources at september   working capital  representing primarily cash  cash equivalents  and restricted and unrestricted short term investments  aggregated million compared to million at september  this decrease of million is primarily due to the payment for the exclusive rights to market and promote novantrone r and related fees totaling million  the purchase of our common stock in september  the transition services fees and maintenance fees paid to serono  as well as net operating cash burn for the period 
this decrease was offset by the net proceeds of million from the issuance of the convertible senior subordinated notes in september  offset by the long term portion of restricted investment securities purchased  sales commissions earned on novantrone r sales for oncology uses in the united states  and cash proceeds from the exercise of options 
on september   we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes in a private placement for net proceeds of million 
on september   the bankers associated with this convertible debt offering exercised an option to purchase an additional million of notes  for an additional net proceeds of million 
the notes bear interest at per annum  payable semi annually  and mature on september  the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to normal and customary adjustments such as stock dividends 
we may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  at any time after september  for a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
if we redeem the notes  the purchase price must be paid in cash 
the holders of the notes have the right to require us to purchase all of the notes  or a portion thereof  on september   september  and september  upon a change of control  as defined in the indenture governing the notes  the holders of the notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all of the notes  or a portion thereof  not previously called for redemption at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes purchased  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
upon the election by the holders of the right to require us to purchase the notes or upon a change in control  we may elect to pay the purchase price in common stock instead of cash 
the number of shares of common stock a holder will receive will equal the purchase price divided by of the average of the closing prices of our common stock for the five trading day period ending on the third business day prior to the purchase date 
accordingly  our liquidity position would not be affected by such a call by the holders of the notes if we elect to pay the purchase price in stock 
the related debt issuance costs of million were deferred and are being amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the notes 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  we used million of the net proceeds for the purchase of  shares of our common stock 
with respect to the notes  we pledged million of us government securities with maturities at various dates through august upon maturity  the proceeds of these restricted investment securities will be sufficient to pay the first six scheduled interest payments on the notes when due 
we consider these restricted investment securities to be held to maturity  as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
these securities are reported at their amortized cost  which includes the direct costs to acquire the securities  plus the amortization of any discount or premium  and accrued interest earned on the securities 
the aggregate fair value and amortized cost of the restricted investment securities at september  were million and million  respectively 
on february   we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes in a private placement for net proceeds to us of approximately million 
the notes bear interest at per annum  payable semi annually  and mature on february  we pledged million of us government securities which will be sufficient to provide for the payment in full of the first six scheduled interest payments on the notes when due 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
we may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  at any time before february  if the closing price of our common stock has exceeded of the conversion price then in effect for a specified period of time 
upon any such early redemption  we are required to pay interest that would have been due through february  we may also redeem some or all of the notes at any time on or after february  if the closing price of our common stock has exceeded of the conversion price then in effect for a specified period of time 
upon a change in control  as defined in the indenture governing the notes  the holders of the notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all of the notes  or a portion thereof  not previously called for redemption at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes purchased  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
upon a change of control  we may elect to pay the purchase price in common stock instead of cash 
accordingly  our liquidity position would not be affected by such a call by the holders of the notes if we elect to pay the purchase price in stock 
the number of shares of common stock a holder would receive would equal the purchase price divided by of the average of the closing prices of our common stock for the five trading day period ending on the third business day prior to the purchase date 
in august and september  we retired a total of million in principal amount of the notes for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  including accrued interest of  the difference between the purchase price and the principal amount of the notes retired and accrued interest resulted in a net gain on the early retirement of the notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal of approximately million net of the write off of related debt issuance cost 
should conditions warrant  we may from time to time continue to enter the market to repurchase additional notes 
if all or any portion of the notes issued in september and february have not been converted into common stock prior to their maturity dates  we will be required to pay  in cash  the outstanding principal amounts of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
this could have a significant impact on our liquidity depending on our cash position at time of maturity 
if we do not have sufficient cash to repay the debt  we may need to borrow additional funds or sell additional equity in order to meet out debt obligations 
we expect to incur continued losses over the next few years as we continue our investment in tarceva tm and other product candidates in our pipeline as well as our research programs and our commercial operations 
the major expenses associated with the broad based phase iii development program for tarceva tm were incurred in fiscal we estimate that our fiscal cash burn will be approximately million 
we have established a goal of achieving profitability and positive cash flow within months of a successful market launch of tarceva tm 
although we believe that we have sufficient cash for operations for the next few years  if the market launch of tarceva tm is delayed or if tarceva tm does not receive fda approval or if the approval process is delayed or takes longer than expected  such events could have a negative impact on our liquidity position  assuming our current cash burn 
in addition  as we continue to pursue strategic in licensing and acquisition opportunities that would bring additional products and clinical development candidates to our cancer pipeline  we will be required to use our available cash and or equity securities 
to achieve profitability  we  alone or with others  must successfully develop and commercialize our technologies and products  conduct pre clinical studies and clinical trials  secure required regulatory approvals and obtain adequate assistance to successfully manufacture  introduce and market such technologies and products 
the ability and time required to reach profitability is uncertain 
we believe that our existing cash resources provide a strong financial base from which to fund our operations and capital requirements for at least the next several years

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation as originally provided by sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
additionally  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosure in both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transitional requirements of sfas no 
are effective for all financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  we adopted the disclosure portion of this statement beginning in the fiscal quarter ended march  the application of the disclosure portion of this standard will have no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
on april   fasb determined that stock based compensation should be recognized as a cost in the financial statements and that such cost be measured according to the fair value of the stock options 
the fasb has not as yet determined the methodology for calculating fair value and plans to issue an exposure draft and final statement in we will continue to monitor communications on this subject from the fasb in order to determine the impact on our consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements a number of the matters and subject areas discussed in this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in item business and elsewhere in this report  that are not historical or current facts  deal with potential future circumstances and developments 
the discussion of these matters and subject areas  is qualified by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations generally  and these discussions may materially differ from our actual future experience involving any one or more of these matters and subject areas 
these forward looking statements are also subject generally to the other risks and uncertainties that are described in this report in item business cautionary factors that may affect future results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our cash flow and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates in our investment portfolio of debt securities  to the fair value of equity instruments held and to foreign currency exchange rates 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various issuers  types and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss included in stockholders equity 
with respect to the convertible senior subordinated notes issued in september and february  we pledged million and million  respectively  of us government securities restricted investment securities with maturities at various dates through august and november  respectively 
upon maturity  the proceeds of the restricted investment securities will be sufficient to pay the first six scheduled interest payments on the convertible senior subordinated notes when due see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we consider our restricted investment securities to be held to maturity  as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
these securities are reported at their amortized cost  which includes the direct costs to acquire the securities  plus the amortization of any discount or premium  and accrued interest earned on the securities 
we have not used or held derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our limited investments in certain biotechnology companies are carried on the equity method or cost method of accounting using the guidance of applicable accounting literature 
other than temporary losses are recorded against earnings in the same period the loss was deemed to have occurred 
we do not currently hedge these exposures 
we at times minimize risk by hedging the foreign currency exchange rates exposure through forward contracts as more fully described in note d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we did not have any forward foreign exchange contracts as of september  at september   we maintained a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less 
we also maintained an investment portfolio principally comprised of government and government agency obligations and corporate obligations that are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
a hypothetical change in interest rates during the year ended september  would have resulted in approximately a  change in our net loss 
our long term debt totaled million at september  and was primarily comprised of the convertible senior subordinated notes we issued in september and february which bear interest at a fixed rate of and  respectively 
underlying market risk exists related to an increase in our stock price or an increase in interest rates which may make the conversion of the convertible senior subordinated notes to common stock beneficial to the convertible senior subordinated notes holders 
conversion of the convertible senior subordinated notes would have a dilutive effect on any future earnings and book value per common share
