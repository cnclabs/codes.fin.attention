overview it is our goal to become a leading provider of molecular diagnostic tests 
we integrate advanced microelectronics and molecular biology into a core technology platform with potentially broad and diverse commercial applications 
our primary areas of focus have been in genomics and biomedical research  medical diagnostics  forensics and drug discovery 
the company s current commercially available products include the nanochip molecular biology workstation  an automated  multi purpose instrument primarily used for dna based analyses  the nanochip cartridge  which incorporates the nanochip electronic microarray and provides a flexible tool for the rapid identification and precise analysis of biological test samples containing charged molecules  various asrs for gene mutations associated with diseases such as cystic fibrosis and hereditary hemochromotosis and assay toolbox  a product designed to help customers develop their own assays on the nanochip system 
the company also has several other asrs and applications of its proprietary technology under development 
the company provides technical support and field applications assistance to its customers 
since commencing operations in  we have applied substantially all of our resources to our research and development programs 
we have incurred losses since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur significant losses over at least the next few years as we attempt to further commercialize our products as well as expand the menu of applications for our current products 
we introduced our first two products into the marketplace in while we recognized revenue from product sales during the years ended december    and  our main sources of revenues during these fiscal years and in were payments under our sponsored research agreements  contracts and grants and  in  a license fee valued at million received from a litigation settlement with combimatrix corp 
we believe that in future periods  however  our revenue base will shift to being more product driven as certain research collaboration agreements expire and new products are introduced to the marketplace 
we believe our future operating results may be subject to quarterly fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  market acceptance of the nanochip system and potential products under development  the type of acquisition program our potential customers may choose  whether and when new products are successfully developed and introduced by us or our competitors  and the achievement of milestones under our collaborative agreements with hitachi and various government agencies 
the recognition of revenue under contracts  grants and sponsored research agreements will be subject to significant fluctuations in both timing and amount and therefore our results of operations for any period may not be comparable to the results of operations for any other period 
the terms of our contracts and grants and sponsored research arrangements vary  but can generally be categorized as follows aventis development program in december  we entered into a letter agreement with aventis for an exclusive research and development collaboration relating to new drug discovery tools and immunodiagnostics research 
in connection with the letter agreement  we entered into a definitive collaborative research and development agreement with an effective date of january  all project milestones were completed and the term of this collaboration agreement expired at the end of in september  we entered into a collaboration agreement with aventis that involved two research and development programs focused on gene expression tools utilizing electronic bioarrays and on the development of high throughput screening tools for protein kinase development 
we retained full commercialization rights for any products resulting from these new projects  while aventis retained the right to use the technology for internal research and development 
all project milestones established under these arrangements were completed as of fiscal year end at which time the agreements had expired 
under these programs  we demonstrated quantitative  multiplexed and reliable gene expression monitoring on our electronic microarray system 
additionally  we delivered an electronic hybridization based gene expression prototype detection system as well as a prototype system for analyzing protein kinases 
the protein kinase prototype system was sold during the fourth quarter of to an affiliate of aventis 
as of december   we had incurred an aggregate of million in direct and indirect research and development costs under these collaboration efforts 
we do not expect to receive additional funding for these projects 
hitachi development program in july  we entered into a year agreement with hitachi to develop  manufacture and distribute products based on the parties proprietary technologies  potentially including  among other things  reduced size instruments for genetic testing  integrated amplification and point of care detection 
the arrangement provides that the parties will jointly determine which projects to prioritize over the term of the agreement 
hitachi has the right to be the exclusive distributor of collaboration products in japan and  based upon the attainment of minimum sales targets to be mutually agreed upon  in other asian countries 
we retain the exclusive right to distribute collaboration products outside of these countries 
either party  subject to certain restrictions  may terminate the agreement before its expiration 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  hitachi and the company each may contribute up to million in cash over the year period 
at a minimum  the company is required to contribute on an annual basis funding for its own general technology development in an amount equal to or greater than payments made by hitachi to the company for that year 
the company received million  of which is a prepayment for research and development activities  million  and million from hitachi during the years ended december    and  respectively 
in addition  the company is liable to repay fifty percent of all funding provided by hitachi over an indefinite period of time 
payment amounts are determined as a percentage of the company s gross nanochip cartridge sales until the liability is paid in full 
the company has completed the identification of requirements phase of the project as of december  and anticipates completion of a prototype by the middle of as of december   we had incurred an aggregate of million in direct research and development costs in addition to other related general technology development costs that exceed million since the beginning of this project in july our failure to achieve established milestones under this collaboration could have a material adverse effect on funding available under this agreement  relations with hitachi and our business  financial condition or results of operations 
darpa grants in september  the company was awarded a contract by the space and naval warfare systems center san diego ssc san diego for the defense advanced research projects agency darpa in an amount totaling approximately million over a two year period 
the goal of the contract is to develop and refine electronically driven sample preparation protocols on specifically designed microelectronic chips 
the contract was completed in january and all milestones have been achieved 
in august  a second darpa contract was granted to nanogen in an amount totaling approximately million over a two year period which was subsequently reduced to million in the contract is focused on developing an electronic sample preparation chip for the detection of biowarfare agents from blood samples 
the contract was completed in november and all milestones have been completed 
as of december   we have incurred an aggregate of million in direct and indirect research and development costs since the beginning of these contracts 
usamraa cooperative agreements the company received funding from two cooperative research agreements with the us army medical research acquisition activity 
the first agreement  entered into in october  is focused on developing technology to identify biological warfare compounds if used in combat against us troops 
the second cooperative agreement  entered into in october  is to continue the development of miniaturized electronic devices for isolation and detection of biological warfare and infectious disease agents 
in conjunction with the agreements  funding provided by the agency is matched dollar for dollar with nanogen funds 
as of december   we have incurred an aggregate of million in direct and indirect research and development costs since the beginning of these collaboration efforts 
nij grant the national institute of justice  us department of justice  provides funding for the development of a chip based genetic detector for rapid dna based identification of individuals 
all milestones contemplated under phase iv  the final phase of this multi year grant  were completed in in july  the company was awarded a phase v grant of million over a two year period  efforts in phase v could result in protocols and reagents suitable for beta testing in crime labs 
as of december   we have incurred an aggregate of million in direct research and development costs since the beginning of this multi year grant 
nih grant the national institute of health  us department of health and human services  provides funding for the development of a compact centrifugal microfluidics based analyzer 
the company received the award in july for approximately  extending over months 
as of december   we have incurred an aggregate of  in direct and indirect research and development cost since the beginning of the contract 
combined sponsored research  contract and grant revenue has declined during the fiscal years ended from our experience in and revenues for consisted of million from government contracts and grant revenue funding and million from sponsored research  all pertaining to the development program entered into in july with hitachi 
revenues during years and were primarily derived from sponsored research and contract and grant funding 
the decline in combined revenue associated with sponsored research  contract and grants between and is the result of the company s strategic shift away from such sponsored research revenue and more towards product revenue 
the company is shifting from primarily sponsored research funding to product revenues as sales and marketing efforts increase the installed base of our nanochip molecular biology workstation and as programs from research and development collaborations expire 
we offer our products to customers under several different types of acquisition programs  some of which pass title of the instrument to the customer and some of which do not pass title to the customer 
one of these acquisition programs is through development site agreements  where title does not pass to the customer  however  these agreements may provide for the potential development of content for use on the nanochip system 
as internal and external content development expand the capabilities of the nanochip system  the company believes that consumable sales  including nanochip cartridge sales and eventually asrs and fda cleared or approved kits will account for an increasing portion of our product revenues 
fiscal year included a number of highlights 
an important milestone for the company was the release of the asrs for the detection of the mutations of the cftr gene most commonly associated with cystic fibrosis  to our first customer site for evaluation 
the company announced a worldwide  non exclusive licensing agreement with bio rad laboratories inc for the two most common gene mutations associated with the diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis hh  a disorder resulting in excessive iron build up in tissues and major organs of the body 
the company also announced in license agreements or collaboration agreements for rights to commercialize mutations in the apoe gene from athena diagnostics that are associated with alzheimers disease  for mutations in the aspa gene associated with the diagnosis of canavan disease and with bionomics limited  an australian company  for mutations to certain genes associated with the diagnosis of epilepsy 
during  the company introduced its first asrs for factor v leiden 
in the first quarter  the company introduced three additional asrs for the cftr gene associated with cystic fibrosis  for the hfe gene associated with hereditary hemochromotosis  and multiplexed asrs for factor ii prothrombin and factor v leiden  genes associated with thrombosis 
in march  the company also introduced a product the assay toolbox a product that is designed to assist research institutions conduct their own home brew assays on the system 
under the asrs model  we will continue to sell blank cartridges in addition to the reagents necessary to perform these tests on the nanochip system 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principals 
these accounting principals require management to make certain judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  service obligations  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we generate product revenue by the sale of our commercial products and services under various sales programs to the end user or through distribution channels 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition in financial statements and record revenues as follows we offer our nanochip molecular biology workstations under various commercial programs such as direct sale  reagent rental programs and cost per test agreements 
we also offer our workstations to customers under development site programs that may result in one of the above commercial transactions 
we sell our workstations direct to the end user and to distributors 
revenue from the sale of consumables is recognized upon shipment fob shipping point as we do not sell consumables with a right of return 
revenue from the direct sale of nanochip molecular biology workstations is recognized following receipt of a purchase order  shipment fob shipping point of product  and transfer of title when sold directly to the end user or to a distributor 
in transactions where a right of return exists  revenue is deferred until acceptance has occurred and the period for the right of return has lapsed 
the nanochip molecular biology workstation is sold with a one year warranty contract 
the fair value of the warranty is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the warranty period included in the customer contract 
the fair value of the warranty is based on the renewal price paid by the same customer 
this renewal price for the maintenance contract is consistent for all customers 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time revenue is recognized 
we also recognize revenue from the sale of our nanochip system under reagent rental and cost per test transactions whereby customers pay a premium for our consumable products nanochip cartridges or asrs over a number of years that is intended to cover the sales price of the nanochip workstation  consumables and warranty 
under a reagent rental transaction  the customer commits to purchasing a fixed number of consumable products on a periodic basis for a specified period of time ie a certain number of cartridges for a certain number of years 
revenue for the workstation  consumables and warranty under reagent rental transactions is recognized as consumable products are shipped  over a period of generally two to five years  depending on the specific customer arrangement as they may vary by customer 
we reclassify the recorded value of the workstation from inventory to fixed assets  recognizing the depreciation expense as cost of sales ratably over the period of the arrangement 
under a cost per reportable transaction  the customer agrees to purchase a certain number of consumable products on a periodic basis determined by the customer s volume of reported test results to third parties from the use of our consumable products 
we recognize revenue under this type of transaction at the time we receive evidence of the customer s test results reported to third parties 
under these arrangements  we provide product warranty coverage for the workstation over the period of the contract 
under both of these sale transactions  the fair value of the warranty is recognized ratably over the warranty period included in the customer contract 
the cost of sales related to the consumables is recorded in line with the revenue ie as consumables are shipped or consumed  depending on the terms of the contract 
we also place our nanochip molecular biology workstations at customer sites under programs  such as development site arrangements  where title of the nanochip workstation does not transfer to the customer 
no revenues are recognized at the time of placement under these agreements 
these arrangements are for a period normally between six and nine months for the purpose of developing content and optimizing assays that may result in the creation or enhancement of intellectual property that we may license in the future 
in addition  a primary intent of the program is for the customer to purchase the nanochip workstation during the period of the arrangement or at its expiration 
we provide a warranty for these nanochip workstations as well as insure them during the development site period 
warranty expense is recorded ratably over the period of the arrangement within selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses 
development site customers are normally required to purchase any consumables to be used on the instrument from us during the development site period 
we classify this inventory as consignment inventory and include this within finished goods 
we record a reserve for the refurbishment costs  recorded within sg a  for each unit included in consignment inventory for the purpose of resale in the event the unit is returned under this arrangement 
in addition  we have recorded a reserve related to the older production units that may be deemed obsolete or sold to the customer at a discount due to the age of the unit during the development site period 
transactions under these types of programs do not result in the recognition of revenue  however  if the customer opts to purchase the nanochip workstation at any time  sales revenue is recognized upon receipt of a purchase order 
cost of sales for the workstation is provided for at the time revenue is recognized 
workstations sold to distributors are sold outright with title transferring at point of shipment ie  ie shipping point without a right of return 
workstations are sold at a discount to the standard sales price but not below the cost of manufacturing the instrument and without warranty coverage 
sales revenue is subject to fluctuation due to the type of acquisition program our customers may choose 
sponsored research and contract and grant revenue are generally recorded as the costs and expenses to perform the research are incurred 
under certain arrangements revenue is recorded ratably over the term of the arrangement as funding is provided for contractually on a scheduled basis 
payments received in advance under these arrangements are recorded as deferred revenue until the expenses are incurred 
continuation of certain sponsored research and contracts and grants are dependent upon our achieving specific contractual milestones 
license fees include nonrefundable fees generated from the licensing of the company s technology 
revenue is recognized immediately when the company has no further obligation to perform and collections are reasonably assured 
bad debt we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we record additions to our reserve based on specific analysis of each customer s balance due us 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
inventory we reduce the carrying value of our inventory  including nanochip molecular biology workstations placed under development site arrangements  for estimated obsolescence or non marketability after considering future purchase commitments and based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
intangible assets we have intangible assets related to acquired technology rights 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
changes in strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues for the year ended december   product sales revenue totaled million compared to million for the year ended december  product sales primarily consists of revenue recognized from the sale of our nanochip molecular biology workstations and nanochip cartridges 
we sold twenty four nanochip systems in compared to thirteen and eight during and  respectively 
in addition  we sold two nanochip systems in each of and under sponsored research programs 
all revenue recorded in connection with sales of our nanochip systems resulted from outright sales transactions where title of the instrument passed to the customer 
we offer our products to customers under several different types of acquisition programs  some of which pass title of the instrument to the customer and some of which do not pass title to the customer 
as of december   we had an installed base of instruments  which consists of outright sales and placements under non title transfer transactions 
our sales revenue may vary from year to year due to  among other things  the types of acquisition programs our potential customers may choose 
for the year ended december   license fees contributed million to revenue as the result of a litigation settlement with combimatrix see note of notes to financial statements 
the amount recorded was based on the fair value of the combimatrix shares received in the settlement 
these fees were non recurring and we do not anticipate recognizing significant license fees in there were no license fee revenues earned for or for the year ended december   revenue from sponsored research totaled million compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
sponsored research revenue in consisted of revenue earned in connection with our development program entered into in july with hitachi totaling million in we expect the hitachi funding to continue at approximately the same level in sponsored research revenue for and included the following revenue earned in connection with our research and development agreement entered into in january and september with aventis totaling million and million for and  respectively  which included the sale of nanochip molecular biology workstations in each year 
revenue earned in connection with the joint venture agreement with becton dickinson  as amended in september  totaling  for revenue earned in connection with our development program entered into in july with hitachi totaling million for and  for all project milestones established under the research and development agreement entered into in september with aventis were completed as of fiscal year end at which time the agreements have expired 
we do not expect to receive additional funding from aventis or becton dickinson under the projects mentioned above 
we fund some of our research and development efforts through contracts and grants awarded by various federal agencies 
revenues are recognized under these contracts and grants as expenses are incurred 
continuation of sponsored research agreements  contracts and grants is dependent upon us achieving specific contractual milestones 
the recognition of revenue under sponsored research agreements and contracts and grants may vary from quarter to quarter and may result in significant fluctuations in operating results from year to year 
cost of sales and gross margins cost of sales totaled million in compared to million and  in and  respectively 
gross margins on product sales revenue were in compared to and in and  respectively 
cost of sales during the years ended december  and were adversely impacted by underabsorbed overhead costs due to underutilized capacity 
the cost per unit of our products remained high  as our volume of production relative to the available capacity remained low 
in and  cost of sales was further impacted by a reserve for obsolete inventory 
gross margins in were also unfavorably impacted due to manufacturing scrap as a result of lower yields on new products released into production 
in comparison  during the year ended december   a portion of sales revenue related to prototypes and therefore did not have the related cost of sales recorded in the period sold as these costs had been expensed as research and development costs in prior years 
as we are still in the early stages of commercialization  we expect to continue to incur significant costs associated with excess production capacity within our manufacturing facility in in addition to underabsorbed overhead costs  cost of sales was further impacted by a reserve for obsolete inventory totaling   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
this reserve relates primarily to excess instrument parts in our inventory that could potentially become obsolete prior to their consumption 
if necessary  these parts will be used as replacement parts for nanogen systems located both internally and at customer sites 
gross margins during these periods were further impacted by sales of nanochip workstations to certain customers under various discount programs and by sales to distributors  which are generally at a discount 
gross margins in future periods may additionally be impaired by minimum product royalties or potential adjustments made to reflect the impairment of intangible assets related to products sold 
research and development expenses research and development expenses totaled million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses from to is primarily the result of costs incurred by our majority owned subsidiary  nanogen recognomics gmbh  which began operations in the third quarter of the majority owned subsidiary recorded losses of million in compared to  in additionally  research and development costs increased from the prior year  in part  as a result of the termination of a collaboration agreement resulting in a loss of  in the loss represented the remaining carrying value of acquired technology rights originally obtained in research and development expenses included the following during the years   and costs of salaries and benefits for scientific  engineering and operations personnel  costs associated with improving and refining our current products as well as development of potential new products and protocols  lab supplies  consulting  travel  facilities  and other expenditures associated with our research and product development activities 
research and development expenses decreased from to as the number of personnel working directly in research and development related activities within our us operations decreased by approximately as a result of a reallocation of personnel to operations 
we anticipate that we will continue to invest in research and product development at approximately the same level as for the foreseeable future 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million in compared to million in and million in the decline in expenses between and is primarily the result of curtailed spending associated with the launch of products and reduced personnel costs 
the increase from to is primarily due to costs associated with the expansion and development of our sales and marketing organization  the expansion of activities related to marketing and selling our products  and increased legal fees associated with enhancing and maintaining our intellectual property portfolio 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to continue at the current level for the foreseeable future as we continue to market and sell our current and potential future products 
litigation and settlement of patent matter the net benefit for litigation and settlement of a patent matter totaled  for the year ended december  and net expenses totaled million for the year ended december  there were no litigation and settlement of patent matter expenses incurred during that were material 
in july  the company entered into a settlement agreement with motorola  genometrix  and mit concluding the declaratory judgment action by the company against motorola  genometrix and mit and motorola s counterclaim against the company 
in connection with the settlement  the company has secured a license from motorola to certain claims of the disputed patent 
in exchange  the company made a one time payment of million in cash and issued  shares of the company s common stock valued at approximately million based upon a per share price of  the fair market value on the date of settlement to the parties involved 
the settlement does not include any cross licensing provisions of the company s technology to motorola  genometrix or mit 
the lawsuit and the counterclaim have now been dismissed 
costs incurred during primarily consist of the settlement fee of million in addition to legal fees incurred related to the litigation process 
costs associated with the litigation and settlement of this matter totaled approximately million for the year ended december  there were no costs incurred during or in september  the company entered into a settlement agreement with combimatrix corp 
combimatrix and dr 
donald montgomery concluding pending litigation in the us district court for the southern district of california 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  nanogen agreed to drop its claims against combimatrix and dr 
montgomery that include certain causes of action relating to us patent nos 
 and  the patented technology that were assigned by dr 
montgomery  an ex nanogen employee  to combimatrix in and assertions relating to other matters 
in exchange  combimatrix agreed to pay million as a reimbursement of legal costs  issue  shares of combimatrix tracking common stock that as of december  became publicly tradable on the nasdaq national market  which represents seventeen and one half percent of its outstanding common stock  and make royalty payments of twelve and one half percent on sales of products by either combimatrix or its affiliates that incorporate the patented technology 
also  as part of the settlement agreement  combimatrix and dr 
montgomery agreed to drop their counterclaims against nanogen and combimatrix retained sole ownership of the patented technology 
the  shares of combimatrix tracking common stock were initially valued at million based on the initial offering price and has been recorded as license fee revenue for the year ended december  the net benefit and costs associated with the litigation and settlement of the combimatrix and dr 
montgomery litigation patent matter totaled approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the benefit of  for the year ended december  is net of the settlement receivable of million from combimatrix 
there were no costs relating to this matter in that were material 
interest income  net we had net interest income of million in compared to million and million  in and  respectively 
the year to year decrease in net interest income is a result of lower average cash and investment balances as well as lower yields on outstanding cash and investment balances during when compared to and based on the continued consumption of cash and short term investments to augment operating activities  we expect net interest income to decline during in other income other income totaled  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  for both years  other income primarily consists of gains realized from the sale of short term investments during the respective years 
we do not anticipate realizing significant gains from the sale of short term securities in in february  the company sold  shares of combimatrix common stock for net proceeds totaling million and recognized a realized loss of approximately million 
minority interest in loss of consolidated subsidiary we had losses relating to our majority owned subsidiary  nanogen recognomics gmbh  of million in compared to  in the losses increased from to as operations for the subsidiary began in the third quarter of we expect to experience continued losses with the majority owned subsidiary similar to levels incurred during these losses are funded by the investment from minority interest investors and are therefore offset against the minority interest balance in the respective balance sheet 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to million at december  this decrease is primarily due to cash used in operations of approximately million offset by securities received from the combimatrix settlement during with a value of million as of december  while the combimatrix securities are included in this category  there is significant risk associated with market value fluctuations in this investment and we expect to receive substantially less than million from the sale of these securities 
in february  the company sold  shares of combimatrix common stock for net proceeds totaling million and recognized a realized loss of approximately million 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the decline in cash used in operating activities from to was primarily due to payments received from receivables 
cash used for operations during   and was primarily related to costs associated with commercializing our products including the expansion  development and support of our sales and marketing organization  the procurement of inventory pursuant to our manufacturing arrangement with hitachi  ltd  support of our continuing research and development efforts  legal fees relating to establishing  maintaining and defending our intellectual property portfolio  and the costs associated with patent litigation 
net cash provided by investing activities totaled million in compared to cash used in investing activities of million and million for and  respectively 
cash provided by investing activities in related to proceeds received from the sale of short term investments 
cash used for investing activities during and primarily related to the purchase of short term securities in an effort to maximize our return while preserving our cash balance 
during the year ended december   we paid million to acquire rights to technologies in order to enable us to further develop and commercialize our products 
net cash provided by financing activities was  million and million for  and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities in primarily related to proceeds received from a development partner totaling million  release of restricted cash balances of approximately  and lease proceeds of  which were primarily offset by payments on capital lease obligations totaling million 
cash provided by financing activities in primarily related to the funds totaling million provided by aventis for the operations of nanogen recognomics as well as funding provided by hitachi under the july research and development agreement 
cash provided by financing activities in primarily related to proceeds received pursuant to our follow on public offering of common stock in march we fund much of our equipment acquisitions and leasehold improvements through capital leasing facilities 
during  equipment and leasehold improvement financing funded  compared to million and  during and  respectively 
we anticipate that we will continue to use capital equipment leasing or debt facilities to fund much of our equipment acquisitions and leasehold improvements 
as of december   we had approximately million of available funding under our equipment lease lines 
the following illustrates  on a comprehensive basis  all recorded liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as included herein and contractual commitments associated with operating leases  purchase commitments and funding commitments under research and development collaborations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations other commitments total less than year years years thereafter capital lease obligations other long term liabilities a operating leases purchase commitments b research and development funding commitments c standby letters of credit d total contractual obligations other commitments a in connection with the agreement entered into with hitachi in july  we are required to repay fifty percent of the total contributions made by hitachi 
payment amounts are determined as a percentage of our gross nanochip cartridge sales until the liability is paid in full 
this liability is non interest bearing and will survive any termination of the agreement among the parties until it is paid 
we have received a total of million since july under this arrangement 
b our manufacturing agreement with hitachi  ltd 
hitachi requires that we provide annual purchase commitments to hitachi for nanochip workstations 
as of december   we had commitments to purchase approximately million in nanochip workstations through june  the requirement of future purchase commitments will be determined based on product demand and inventory levels 
in connection with the service agreement established with hitachi in october  as amended in december  we have committed to provide hitachi with a minimum of  in payments for maintenance service provided in fiscal c we are required to contribute on an annual basis funding for its own general technology development in an amount equal to or greater than payments made by hitachi under the research and development agreement established in july amounts included in the table above assume hitachi will make all scheduled payments under this arrangement totaling million since inception of the agreement in fiscal in connection with the formation of nanogen recognomics in fiscal  we are required to spend an aggregate of million  at a rate of million per year beginning april   for our own general technology development which benefits the commercialization and development of potential nanogen recognomics products 
d payments are not required under the standby letters of credit and expire at various dates and therefore the table above does not reflect payment information over the five year period 
the company is a party to development site agreements with various entities whereby the company may be obligated to pay license fees or royalties for any customer owned or licensed intellectual property used to develop any nanogen commercial products 
none of these agreements individually are considered material 
we expect that our existing capital resources  combined with anticipated revenues from potential product sales  reagent rentals  leases or other types of acquisition programs for the nanochip system  sponsored research agreements  contracts and grants will be sufficient to support our planned operations through at least the next eighteen months 
this estimate of the period for which we expect our available sources of liquidity to be sufficient to meet our capital requirements is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results may differ materially 
our future liquidity and capital funding requirements will depend on numerous factors including  but not limited to  commercial success of our products  or lack thereof  of our current products  the extent to which our products under development are successfully developed and gain market acceptance  the timing of regulatory actions regarding our potential products  the costs and timing of expansion of sales  marketing and manufacturing activities  prosecution and enforcement of patents important to our business and any litigation related thereto  the results of clinical trials  competitive developments  and our ability to maintain existing collaborations and to enter into additional collaborative arrangements 
we have incurred negative cash flow from operations since inception and do not expect to generate positive cash flow to fund our operations for at least the next several years 
we may need to raise additional capital to fund our research and development programs  to scale up manufacturing activities and expand our sales and marketing efforts to support the commercialization of our products under development 
additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our operations significantly or to obtain funds through entering into collaborative agreements or other arrangements on unfavorable terms 
our failure to raise capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations
