item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
recommends that all companies include a discussion of critical accounting policies used in the preparation of their financial statements 
the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and those that require significant judgments and estimates 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience  actuarial valuations and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and  consequently  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while for any given estimate or assumption made by our management there may be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable  we believe that  given the current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable estimate or assumption would materially impact the financial statements 
the accounting principles we utilized in preparing our consolidated financial statements conform in all material respects to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the accounting policies identified as critical are as follows valuation of receivables the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
the company continuously monitors payments from customers and a provision for estimated uncollectible amounts is maintained based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues  which have been identified 
while such uncollectible amounts have historically been within the company s expectations and provisions established  if a customer s financial condition were to deteriorate  additional reserves may be required 
concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally mitigated due to the large number of entities comprising the company s customer base  their dispersion across geographic areas and industries  along with the company s policy of maintaining credit insurance 
valuation of inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by using the first in  first out and average cost methods 
the company s inventories are comprised of high technology components sold to rapidly changing and competitive markets whereby such inventories may be subject to early technological obsolescence 
the company evaluates inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors rendering inventories as unsellable at normal gross profit margins 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate market value and take into account the company s contractual provisions with its suppliers governing price protections and stock rotations 
due to the large number of transactions and complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are made regarding the valuation of inventory at market value 
in addition  assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions to discontinue certain product lines can impact the decision to write down inventories 
if assumptions about future demand change and or actual market conditions are different than those projected by management  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
in any case  actual results may be different than those estimated 
goodwill and other intangible assets the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of acquired companies allocated to goodwill 
other intangible assets primarily represent franchise agreements and non compete covenants 
we evaluate long lived assets used in operations  including goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
the allocation of the acquisition cost to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on our future operating results as the allocation process requires the extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
an impairment review is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant industry or economic trends 
when impairment indicators areidentified with respect to previously recorded intangible assets  the values of the assets are determined using discounted future cash flow techniques 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of the projected discounted cash flows and should different conditions prevail  material write downs of net intangible assets and goodwill could occur

 consolidation of variable interest entities 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
a variable interest entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in activities on behalf of another company 
until now  a company generally has included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin no 
changes that by requiring a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin no 
s consolidation requirements apply immediately to variable interest entities created or acquired after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
the company does not have any variable interest entities which would require consolidation under fin no 
accordingly  the adoption of fin no 
has had no effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items in our statement of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods shown net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating loss profit interest expense loss earnings before income taxes income tax benefit provision net loss earnings comparison of fiscal year ended june  fiscal with fiscal year ended june  fiscal net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of  as compared to million for fiscal we have seen an increase in net sales to certain customers where inventory management programs have been implemented 
it has been our focus to offer value added services to enhance value 
although there are indications of improvement  including certain customers in different industry segments who have seen their business improve  it is too early to be certain when this will lead to a general recovery in our industry 
on june   the company acquired certain assets of the electronics distribution operations of reptron 
sales included in fiscal associated with the reptron acquisition were approximately million 
for fiscal flat panel display fpd sales represented approximately of our total distribution sales 
passive components represented approximately of our distribution sales and active components  including fpd s  represented approximately of our distribution sales during fiscal gross profit was million  or for fiscal  as compared to million  or for fiscal the fiscal gross profit includes inventory write downs of approximately million  of which approximately million was provided for in the fourth quarter of fiscal pricing of components continues to be highly competitive due to the availability of product 
our sales growth has been through the automated inventory programs  which have a high concentration of semiconductors that sell at lower margins 
we do anticipate our margins to improve slightly due to sales associated with the reptron acquisition  which historically have been at higher margins than ours 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or compared to million in fiscal we continue to strive to operate more efficiently 
we continue to eliminate discretionary spending  while being careful not to impact our ability to service customers 
we do anticipate our sg a expenses to increase due to the reptron acquisition 
interest expense decreased to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal  representing a decrease of million  or 
the decrease can be attributed to a reduction of the average long term debt balance for fiscal as compared to fiscal we do expect an increase in interest expense as a result of additional borrowings due to the reptron acquisition 
net loss for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss during fiscal of million  or per diluted share 
as a result of our decrease in sg a expenses and interest expense  we were able to reduce our net loss for fiscal  as compared to fiscal comparison of fiscal with fiscal year ended june  fiscal net sales for fiscal were million  a decrease of  as compared to million for fiscal the electronics industry continued to be impacted by weak demand for components worldwide 
our customers had not increased their production to levels that would utilize the excess inventory maintained by such customers 
for fiscal fpd sales represented approximately of our total distribution sales 
passive components represented approximately of our distribution sales and active components  including fpd s  represented approximately of our distribution sales during fiscal gross profit was million  or for fiscal  as compared to million  or for fiscal the fiscal gross profit included inventory write downs of approximately million  of which approximately million was provided for in the fourth quarter of fiscal the gross profit margin decrease reflected both the continued pressure on component pricing due to weak demand throughout the industry allowing customers to negotiate lower prices and a higher percentage of sales of product that historically sold at lower margins 
sg a expenses were million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or compared to million in fiscal the decrease is attributable to a reduction in the number of employees  discretionary spending and a decrease in variable costs 
we have implemented a plan to reduce costs while business conditions do not improve 
variable costs have been reduced as a result of the reduction in sales and gross profit since most of our sales personnel receive a portion of their compensation based upon a percentage of gross profit 
interest expense decreased to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal  representing a decrease of million  or 
the reduction reflected lower borrowing levels as a result of decreases in accounts receivable and inventory 
additionally  interest rates declined during the fiscal year 
net loss for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to net earnings during fiscal of million  or per diluted share 
the net loss was primarily attributable to the weak condition of the electronics industry resulting in a decrease in net sales 
the reduction in net sales was partially offset by a decrease in sg a expenses and interest expense 
liquidity and capital resources our agreement with our banks  as amended  provides us with a  revolving line of credit facility 
the credit facility is based principally on our eligible accounts receivable and inventories as defined in the agreement 
the agreement was amended on september  to i extend the maturity date to march   ii reduce the credit facility line from million to million  and iii change the requirements of certain financial covenants 
the agreement was amended on may  to extend the maturity date to june  the agreement was subsequently amended on september  to extend the maturity date to october   and waive noncompliance of a certain financial covenant 
the agreement also requires us to maintain an  compensating balance arrangement with our banks in an interest bearing account  which was funded during the quarter ended december  the interest rate was based on the average day libor plus to depending on our performance for the immediately preceding four fiscal quarters measured by a specified financial ratio 
effective october   the rate converted to the average day libor plus to 
effective september   the rate converted to the higher of the prime rate plus or the federal funds rate plus 
in addition  the rate will convert to the higher of the prime rate plus or the federal funds rate plus if certain terms under the agreement are not met by december  borrowings under this facility are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
the outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit facility was  at june   with an associated interest rate of 
the agreement contains provisions for the maintenance of certain financial covenants  and prohibits the payment of cash dividends 
failure to remain in compliance with these covenants could trigger an acceleration of our obligation to repay all outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
for fiscal  our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  as compared to million for the same period last fiscal year 
the decrease in net cash provided is primarily attributable to a smaller decrease in our inventory and an increase in our accounts receivable for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to the same period in our last fiscal year 
this was partially offset by an increase in our accounts payable for the fiscal year ended june  net cash used in investing activities increased to million for the fiscal year ended june   as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of certain operating assets of reptron  representing a net cash outlay of million 
the increase is also attributable to deferred payments of million for the fiscal year ended june  related to our acquisition in june of interface  as compared to deferred payments of million for the fiscal year ended june  net cash used in financing activities was million for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to million for the same period in our last fiscal year 
the decrease in net cash used is primarily attributable to net borrowings under our credit facility of approximately million for the fiscal year ended june   as compared to net payments of million for the fiscal year ended june  for fiscal and fiscal  our inventory turnover was x and x  respectively 
the average days outstanding of our accounts receivable at june  was days  as compared to days at june  we believe that cash flow from operations and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our capital needs for the foreseeable future 
however  our cash expenditures may vary significantly from current levels  based on a number of factors  including  but not limited to future acquisitions  if any 
historically  we have been able to obtain amendments to our existing credit facility to satisfy financial covenants 
while there can be no assurances that such financing or future amendment  if needed  will be available  management believes we will be able to continue to obtain financing on acceptable terms 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet debt  nor do we have any transactions  arrangements or relationships with any special purpose entities 
contractual obligations this table summarizes our known contractual obligations and commercial commitments at june  total years long term debt    capital lease    operating lease    total    inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during the last three fiscal years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes with respect to borrowings under our credit facility which bears interest at the higher of the prime rate plus or the federal funds rate plus 
at august   million was outstanding under the credit facility 
changes in the prime interest rate or the federal funds rate during fiscal will have a positive or negative effect on our interest expense 
each fluctuation in the prime interest rate or the federal funds rate will increase or decrease interest expense for us by approximately million based on outstanding borrowings at august  the impact of interest rate fluctuations on other floating rate debt is not material
