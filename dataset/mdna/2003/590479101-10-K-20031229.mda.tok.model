item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto  and the selected financial data and operating statistics contained elsewhere herein 

table of contents critical accounting estimates and judgments the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in connection with the preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  medical claims reserve  valuation of assets held for sale and costs to return aircraft and a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
such historical experience and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact of these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
the discussion below is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which contains accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
revenue recognition the america west  united  frontier and the us airways regional jet code share agreements are revenue guarantee flying agreements 
under a revenue guarantee arrangement  the major airline generally pays a fixed monthly minimum amount  plus certain additional amounts based upon the number of flights flown and block hours performed 
the contracts also include reimbursement of certain costs incurred by mesa in performing flight services 
these costs  known as pass through costs  may include aircraft ownership cost  passenger and hull insurance  aircraft property taxes as well as  fuel  landing fees and catering 
the contracts also include a profit component that may be determined based on a percentage of profits on the mesa flown flights  a profit margin on certain reimbursable costs as well as a profit margin based on certain operational benchmarks 
the company primarily recognizes revenue under its revenue guarantee agreements when the transportation is provided 
the majority of the revenue under these contracts is known at the end of the accounting period and is booked as actual 
the company performs an estimate of the profit component based upon the information available at the end of the accounting period 
all revenue recognized under these contracts is presented at the gross amount billed 
the america west  us airways  and midwest airlines bd turboprop code share agreements are pro rate agreements 
under a prorate agreement  the company receives a percentage of the passenger s fare based on a standard industry formula that allocates revenue based on the percentage of transportation provided 
revenue from our pro rate agreements and our independent operation is recognized when transportation is provided 
tickets sold but not yet used are included in air traffic liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company also receives subsidies for providing scheduled air service to certain small or rural communities 
such revenue is recognized in the period in which the air service is provided 
the amount of the subsidy payments is determined by the united states department of transportation on the basis of its evaluation of the amount of revenue needed to meet operating expenses and to provide a reasonable return on investment with respect to eligible routes 
eas rates are normally set for two year contract periods for each city 
allowance for doubtful accounts amounts billed by the company under revenue guarantee arrangements are subject to our interpretation of the applicable code share agreement and are subject to audit by our code share partners 
periodically our 
table of contents code share partners dispute amounts billed and pay amounts less than the amount billed 
ultimate collection of the remaining amounts not only depends upon mesa prevailing under audit  but also upon the financial well being of the code share partner 
as such  the company periodically reviews amounts past due and records a reserve for amounts estimated to be uncollectible 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at september  and  respectively 
if the company s actual ability to collect these receivables and the actual financial viability of its partners is materially different than estimated  the company s estimate of the allowance could be materially understated or overstated 
accrued health care costs the company is currently self insured for health care costs and as such  a reserve for the cost of claims that have not been paid as of the balance sheet date is estimated 
the company s estimate of this reserve is based upon historical claim experience and upon the recommendations of its health care provider 
at september  and  the company accrued million and million  respectively  for the cost of future health care claims 
if the ultimate development of these claims is significantly different than those that have been estimated  the reserves for future health care claims could be materially overstated or understated 
long lived assets  aircraft and parts held for sale property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives to their estimated salvage values using the straight line method 
long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may be impaired 
under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company records an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows are found to be less than the carrying amount of the asset 
if an impairment loss has occurred  a charge is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the asset to fair market value 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets the company records deferred tax assets for the value of benefits expected to be realized from the utilization of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards and state and federal net operating loss carryforwards 
the company periodically reviews these assets for realizability based upon expected taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions 
to the extent the company believes some portion of the benefit may not be realizable  an estimate of the unrealized portion is made and an allowance is recorded 
at september  and  the company had a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets not expected to be realized of million and million  respectively 
realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of any net operating loss carryforwards 
the company believes it will generate sufficient taxable income in the future to realize these net operating loss carryforwards as the company has had pretax income in fiscal  and excluding impairment charges and as the company has taken steps to minimize the financial impact of its unprofitable subsidiaries 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax asset  net of the valuation allowance provided  will be realized 
if the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is significantly different than those that have been estimated  the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets could be materially overstated or understated 
results of operations general mesa air group  inc and its subsidiaries collectively referred to herein as mesa or the company is an independent regional airline serving cities in states  canada  the bahamas and mexico 
at september   mesa operated a fleet of aircraft and had approximately daily departures 
mesa s airline operations during fiscal year were primarily conducted by three regional airline subsidiaries primarily utilizing hub and spoke systems 
mesa airlines  a wholly owned subsidiary of mesa  
table of contents operates as america west express under a code share and revenue sharing agreement with america west airlines  inc  as us airways express under a code sharing agreement with us airways  inc  as united jet express under a code sharing agreement with united and as frontier jet express under a code sharing agreement with frontier 
air midwest  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of mesa  operates under a code sharing agreement with us airways and flies as us airways express and also operates an independent division  doing business as mesa airlines  from albuquerque  new mexico and dallas  texas

the primary reason for the increase was the additional revenue derived from placing regional jets into service in offsetting this increase  pro rate revenue at air midwest decreased million and pro rate revenue at ccair decreased million 
the decrease in pro rate revenue was primarily due to a decrease in passengers carried by air midwest and ccair  the reduction of four turboprop aircraft in service as a result of the cessation of ccair s operations  as well as a nine percent decrease in the average fare as a result of industry economic conditions 
under revenue guarantee contracts  we are substantially insulated from industry passenger trends 

table of contents operating expenses flight operations in fiscal  flight operations expense increased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal flight operations expense for mesa and freedom increased million due to the additional costs associated with operating the additional regional jets that were placed into service in  net of any purchase incentives received in conjunction with the additional jets 
this increase was offset by a decrease of million in flight operations expense at ccair  due to the cessation of its operations in november of the decrease on a cost per asm basis for the year ended september   is a result of the increase in both the proportion of regional jets to turboprops  as well as the addition of larger regional jets which  on a relative basis  produce more asms per mile 
regional jets generally have lower operating costs per asm than turboprop aircraft 
fuel in fiscal  fuel expense increased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal fuel expense at mesa and freedom increased million due to the addition of regional jets and fuel expense at air midwest increased million due to the additional flying assumed by air midwest after the cessation of operations at ccair 
the increase is also due to a increase in the average price of fuel  or cents per gallon  due to the rising costs of fuel in the past year primarily as a result of the war in iraq 
these increases were offset by a decrease in fuel expense at ccair of million due to the cessation of its operations 
the increase on an asm basis is due to the increase in the average price of a gallon of fuel 
maintenance expense in fiscal  maintenance expense increased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal mesa and freedom maintenance expenses increased million primarily as a result of an increased number of aircraft in the fleet  increased repair costs on certain rotable parts and increased engine overhaul expenses at mesa airlines 
air midwest s maintenance expense increased million primarily as a result of transitioning to the power by the hour program for engines and an increase in heavy maintenance checks 
maintenance expenses in the other segment increased million due to our procurement company incurring rotable repair expenses as well as certain purchasing related administrative expenses 
these increases in maintenance expense were offset by a decrease at ccair of million due to the cessation of its operations 
the decrease on an asm basis is due to the lower operating costs of flying regional jets versus turboprop aircraft 
aircraft and traffic servicing expense in fiscal  aircraft and traffic servicing expense increased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal mesa and freedom aircraft and traffic serving expenses increased million due to the additional costs associated with operating the additional regional jets that were placed into service in offsetting this increase was a million decrease at ccair due to the cessation of its operations 
the decrease on a cost per asm basis for the year ended september   is a result of an increase in the proportion of regional jet asms in our fleet 
regional jets generally have lower operating costs per asm than turboprop aircraft 
promotion and sales in fiscal  promotion and sales expense decreased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the decrease is due to a decline in the booking and franchise fees paid by air midwest and ccair under pro rate agreements with their code share partners caused by a decline in passenger carried under these agreements 
the company does not pay these fees under its regional jet revenue contracts 

table of contents general and administrative expense in fiscal  general and administrative expense decreased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the decrease is primarily due to a reduction in bad debt expense of million as a result of collections on certain receivables that were reserved in prior years 
legal and professional expense decreased million in as a result of the large charge associated with the beus gilbert lawsuit that was recognized in these decreases were offset by an increase in property taxes of million  primarily due to the addition of jet aircraft in and an increase in accrued compensation and benefits of million due to headcount increases 
depreciation and amortization in fiscal  depreciation and amortization expense remained at million cents per asm compared to million cents per asm in fiscal impairment and restructuring charges credits in  the company recognized an additional impairment charge of million related to the costs of returning beechcraft d aircraft to the manufacturer 
the company also reversed million in restructuring charges for future aircraft leases related to ccair aircraft that were returned to the lessor and million in aircraft related return costs for these same aircraft 
the reversal of these charges was precipitated by the dissolution of ccair and the company s subsequent determination  after consultation with counsel  that the company should not be held legally responsible for the aircraft lease obligations and aircraft related return costs incurred solely by ccair and not guaranteed by the company 
interest expense interest expense increased million from million in to million in the increase is due to million interest expense related to the senior convertible notes that were issued in june of this increase was offset by reduced interest on the company s bd debt as three bd aircraft were returned under our agreement with raytheon and the outstanding debt on another was settled as a result of the crash of flight other expense in fiscal  other expense decreased million from million in to million in in fiscal year  other expense is primarily comprised of the settlement with the dot of million related to payments made to the company under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act passed after the terrorist acts of september  also included in other expense is million in net investment related losses on the company s portfolio of aviation related securities 
these expenses were offset by the gain on an involuntary conversion of an aircraft of million related to the crash of flight as well as other income received of million for tsa funds collected on the company s behalf under the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act of by us airways and frontier 
included in other expense in fiscal is million in net investment related losses from the company s portfolio of aviation related securities  including million incurred by our subsidiary ufly 
the minority interest in these losses is deducted out of our net income or loss after income taxes 
fiscal versus fiscal operating revenues in fiscal  operating revenues decreased by million to million  from million in fiscal mesa and freedom revenue increased million 
the primary reason for the increase was the addition of regional jets that were placed into service in eight of which were operated 
table of contents pursuant to revenue guarantee agreements for the majority of the year 
offsetting this increase  pro rate revenue at air midwest decreased million and pro rate revenue at ccair decreased million 
the decrease in pro rate revenue was primarily due to reductions in pro rate flying capacity and industry wide declines in load factors as a result of september th 
as a result of decreases in capacity and the effects of the events of september   passengers traveling on such pro rate flights decreased for the year 
under revenue guarantee contracts  we are substantially insulated from industry passenger trends 
operating expenses flight operations in fiscal  flight operations expense increased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal flight operations expense for mesa and freedom increased million due to the addition of regional jets  net of any purchase incentives received in conjunction with the additional jets 
this increase was offset by decreases of million at air midwest and million at ccair  which were primarily attributable to the reduction in turboprop flying as well as cost reduction initiatives related to the turboprop operation that included million associated with the raytheon agreement 
fuel in fiscal  fuel expense decreased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the decrease in fuel is due to a decrease in the average price of a gallon of fuel slightly offset by a five percent increase in fuel consumed 
the decrease in the average price of a gallon of fuel is a result of a drop in demand due to the terrorist attacks that took place on september  the decrease on an asm basis is due to the decrease in the average price of a gallon of fuel 
maintenance expense in fiscal  maintenance expense decreased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the decrease in maintenance costs for fiscal is primarily the result of million in benefits received by air midwest as part of the cost reduction agreement reached with raytheon aerospace and reduced turboprop flights at both air midwest and ccair 
this decrease was offset by higher than expected engine maintenance in the fourth quarter at mesa and freedom due to problems related to unexpected component failures  resulting in the premature removal and overhaul of jet engines 
the decrease in cost per asm is a result of an increase in the proportion of regional jet asms and the turboprop cost reduction initiatives 
aircraft and traffic servicing expense in fiscal  aircraft and traffic servicing expense decreased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the decrease in aircraft and traffic service expense is primarily due to reductions in turboprop flights that resulted in decreases of million at air midwest and million at ccair 
these decreases were slightly offset by an increase in aircraft and traffic servicing expense at mesa and freedom of million due to the operation of more regional jets 
on an asm basis  the reduction is a result of the increase in the proportion of regional jet asms 
the company can service regional jets with the same number of personnel as smaller turboprop aircraft even though regional jets carry more passengers 
in addition  the company also had more regional jets in service under the us airways contract in than in under our regional jet contract with us airways  many of the aircraft and traffic servicing expenses are absorbed directly by us airways 
promotion and sales in fiscal  promotion and sales expense decreased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the decrease is primarily a result of decreases in booking fees and franchise fees paid to the company s code share partners by air midwest and ccair as a result of 
table of contents the decrease in pro rate passenger traffic 
our contract with america west and our jet contract with us airways eliminate booking fees and travel agency commissions being charged directly to the company and as such  these costs per asm are expected to decline as the america west express and us airways express jet operations continue to grow 
general and administrative expense in fiscal  general and administrative expense decreased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the decrease is primarily due to a reduction in bad debt expense of million at mesa and freedom  which was due to allowances for receivables recorded in the prior year as a result of the effect that terrorist attacks that took place on september  had on our code share partners 
in addition  professional fees at mesa decreased approximately million as the majority of the legal costs associated with the beus gilbert matter were accrued in we also reduced our k matching contribution by million in these decreases were offset by increases in passenger liability insurance of million due to increased premiums as a result of the events of september  as well as a million contract claim release to us airways as a result of the us airways bankruptcy restructuring 
depreciation and amortization in fiscal  depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the decrease in depreciation occurred primarily at air midwest as a result of the cessation of depreciation on aircraft and parts held for sale and reduced depreciation expense on the aircraft that were impaired at september  we are also no longer incurring goodwill amortization expense as all goodwill was written off at september  impairment and restructuring charges in fiscal  the company s subsidiary  ccair made a decision to discontinue its operations 
as a result of this decision  ccair recorded a restructuring and impairment charge of million 
the charge is comprised of million of severance and other employee related liabilities  million in aircraft related return costs  million for future aircraft lease payments  million to reduce the value of rotable and expendable inventory to fair market value less costs to sell  million to write off the value of equipment and leasehold improvements and million to reduce maintenance deposits held by a lessor to net realizable value 
also in fiscal  we returned of the bd aircraft permitted under our agreement with raytheon 
as a result of unanticipated increases in the cost of meeting return conditions  mesa and freedom recorded an additional impairment charge of million 
the remaining three aircraft are expected to be returned to raytheon in fiscal a charge of million was also taken in the other segment to accrue for the remaining lease payments and future costs of returning two shorts aircraft the company is subleasing to an operator in europe 
interest expense the decrease in interest expense of million from million in to million in primarily occurred at mesa and freedom due to reduced interest rates on our beechcraft d aircraft as the majority of the fleet is financed at variable interest rates as well as million in benefits received by air midwest from raytheon aerospace as part of the cost reduction agreement 
other income and expense in fiscal  other income and expense decreased million from income of million in to expense of million in included in other income is million in net investment related losses unrealized losses of million offset by realized gains of million 
the investment losses in the other segment include losses from the company s portfolio of aviation related 
table of contents securities  including million incurred by our subsidiary ufly 
the minority interest in these losses is deducted out of our net income or loss after income taxes 
included in other income for fiscal was million in grants awarded by the dot as part of the airline transportation safety and system stabilization act  of this amount  mesa was awarded million  air midwest was awarded million and ccair was awarded million 
liquidity and capital resources the company had cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities of million at september   compared to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million at september  primary sources of cash included net cash provided by operating activities of million  net proceeds of million from the placement of senior convertible debentures  proceeds from aircraft insurance of million  proceeds from the sale of rotable and expendable inventory of million  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million 
offsetting these sources of cash  our primary uses of cash included capital expenditures of million related to the build up of inventory as a result of the current and future expansions of our aircraft fleet net of the receipt of deferred credits  deposits on aircraft orders of million  principal payments of million on our long term debt  and the purchase and retirement of our common stock of million 
our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are intended to be used for working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
in june  we completed the private placement of senior convertible notes due  which resulted in gross proceeds of million to us 
net proceeds from the offering totaled million 
the proceeds will be used to improve our overall liquidity by providing working capital and will be used for general corporate purposes 
cash interest is payable on the notes at the rate of per year on the original issue amount principal amount at maturity  payable semiannually in arrears on june and december of each year  beginning december   until june  after that date  we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity  and the notes will begin accruing interest at a rate of until maturity 
on june   the maturity date of the notes  the principal amount of each note will be  the aggregate amount due at maturity  including interest accrued from june   will be million 
each of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries guarantees the notes on an unsecured senior basis 
the notes and the note guarantees are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness 
the notes and the note guarantees are junior to any of our secured obligations at any of our wholly owned subsidiaries to the extent of the collateral pledged 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  in principal amount at maturity of the notes which equals an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
this conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
holders of the notes may convert their notes if i after june   the sale price of our common stock exceeds of the accreted conversion price for at least trading days in the consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding quarter  ii prior to june   the trading price for the notes falls below certain thresholds  iii the notes have been called for redemption  or iv specified corporate transactions occur 
we may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  beginning on june   at a redemption price equal to the issue price  plus accrued original issue discount  plus any accrued and unpaid cash interest 
the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes on june  at a price of per note plus accrued and unpaid cash interest  if any  on june  at a price of per note plus accrued and unpaid cash interest  if any  and on june  at a price of per note plus accrued and unpaid cash interest  if any 
as of september   the notes have met the criteria described above and are eligible for conversion 
the remainder of our long term debt was primarily incurred pursuant to the acquisition of our bd aircraft 
in  the company retired million in debt by returning three bd aircraft 
the company also retired million in debt with insurance proceeds from the crash of flight at september   we owned bd aircraft that have underlying maturities from through 
table of contents as of september   we had receivables of approximately million net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million  compared to million net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million at september  the amounts due consist primarily of receivables due from our code share partners and passenger ticket receivables due through the airline clearing house 
the allowance for doubtful accounts decreased as a result of the settlement with us airways where previously reserved receivables were written off against the allowance and as a result of collections from america west of a portion of the receivables that were previously reserved 
during fiscal  we had code share agreements with america west  us airways  frontier  united and midwest airlines 
approximately  and of the company s consolidated passenger revenue for the years ended september   and  respectively  were derived from these agreements 
accounts receivable from our code share partners were of total gross accounts receivable at september  and a termination of the america west  united  or us airways code share agreements specifically the jet contracts would have a material adverse effect on our business prospects  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
if termination without renewal should occur  management believes they would be able to reduce costs quickly through reductions in headcount or parking aircraft 
additionally management believes they could continue flying certain routes or transfer certain aircraft  particularly the regional jets  to new markets and new code share arrangements with other carriers 
as of december   we had cash and marketable securities in excess of million 
on june   the company entered into a letter of intent with logistechs inc logistechs  an affiliate of ge capital aviation services  for the sale  repair and management of the company s aircraft spare parts inventory 
under the terms of the letter of intent  logistechs will purchase to million in existing spare parts inventory from the company and purchase additional inventory required to meet specified service levels for the company s planned regional jet fleet growth 
logistechs will also provide overall management  planning and logistics support for the company s spare parts requirements and rockwell collins aviation services will be responsible for managing the spare parts repair process 
the arrangement will cover all of the company s regional jets as well as its dash turboprop aircraft 
the transaction  which remains subject to final documentation  will have a term of ten years 
the company expects to finalize the transaction in the third quarter of at september   we had four aircraft remaining on order under our june aircraft purchase agreement with empresa brasiliera de aeronautica sa embraer 
in conjunction with this purchase agreement  we had million remaining on deposit with embraer  which was included with lease and equipment deposits at september  the remaining deposit was returned upon delivery of the last four aircraft in december since  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million shares of our outstanding common stock 
as of september   we had acquired and retired approximately million shares approximately of our outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately million  leaving approximately million shares available for repurchase under the existing board authorizations 
purchases are made at management s discretion based on market conditions and the company s financial resources 
in december  the company entered into an agreement with fleet capital for a million line of credit  collateralized by the company s inventory and receivables 
the agreement contained a financial covenant that required the maintenance of certain financial ratios related to fixed charge coverage and total debt to capital 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at september  we had million in letters of credit outstanding at september   which reduced the amount available under the line of credit with fleet 
there were no other amounts outstanding under this facility at september  based upon available collateral  million remained available under the line at september  the agreement expires in december and was not renewed 
as of december   million in letters of credit remained outstanding  which the company has cash collateralized with 
table of contents fleet 
upon termination of the agreement  the collateralization of these letters of credit results in the company having restricted cash 
as of december   we have aircraft remaining on order under our may aircraft purchase agreement with brad 
in conjunction with this purchase agreement  we had million remaining on deposit with brad  which was included with lease and equipment deposits at september  the remaining deposits will be returned on a pro rata basis in equal amounts upon completion of permanent financing on each of the last five aircraft million per aircraft 
as of september   the company had permanently financed of the crj and crj aircraft delivered under the brad agreement  the remaining ten aircraft were subject to interim financing 
subsequent to year end  the company took delivery of two additional bombardier crj aircraft  both of which were delivered with interim financing 
in december  the company completed permanent financing of one crj and seven crj aircraft  increasing the number of aircraft available under the interim facility by seven 
the company currently has five aircraft on interim financing provided by the manufacturer and its ability to obtain additional interim financing is contingent upon obtaining permanent financing for the aircraft already delivered 
there are no assurances the company will be able to obtain permanent financing for existing or future aircraft deliveries 
we have significant long term lease obligations primarily relating to our aircraft fleet 
the leases are classified as operating leases and are therefore excluded from our consolidated balance sheets 
at september   we leased aircraft with remaining lease terms ranging from to years 
future minimum lease payments due under all long term operating leases were approximately billion at september  on december   the company acquired the assets of bankrupt midway airlines corporation for million 
assets acquired included two owned crj aircraft  all of midway s crj spare parts and support equipment  all aircraft landing and or takeoff slots at new york laguardia and washington national airports  and all related acquisition materials associated with the operation of midway s crj operations 
the company also assumed the leases on six crj aircraft and midway s right to three additional leased aircraft 
the company expects to operate the aircraft under its existing code share agreements 
management believes that the company will have adequate cash flow to meet our operating needs 
this is a forward looking statement 
actual cash flows could materially differ from this forward looking statement as a result of many factors  including the termination of one or more code share agreements  failure to sell  dispose of  or redeploy excess aircraft in a timely manner  a substantial decrease in the number of routes allocated to us under its code share agreements with our code share partners  reduced levels of passenger revenue  additional taxes or costs of compliance with governmental regulations  fuel cost increases  increases in competition  additional terrorist attacks  increases in interest rates  general economic conditions and unfavorable settlement of existing litigation 
contractual obligations as of september   we had million in long term debt including current maturities 
this amount consisted primarily of million in notes payable related to the company s fleet of beechcraft d turboprop aircraft  million related to the issuance of the senior convertible notes  million related to the settlement of past contractual claims of an aircraft manufacturer  and million related to a mortgage note payable on one of our real estate properties

represents the estimated cost of commitments to acquire crj  crj and erj aircraft in the future 
the acquisitions are expected to be accounted for as off balance sheet operating leases having lease terms of years 
maintenance commitments in january  the company entered into a year engine maintenance contract with general electric aircraft engines ge for its crj aircraft 
the agreement was subsequently amended in the first quarter of fiscal the amended contract requires a monthly payment based upon the prior month s flight hours incurred by the covered engines 
the hourly rate increases over time based upon the engine overhaul costs that are expected to be incurred in that year and is subject to escalation based on changes in certain price indices 
maintenance expense is recognized based upon the product of flight hours flown and the rate in effect for the period 
the contract also provides for a fixed number of engine overhauls per year 
to the extent that the number of actual overhauls is less than the fixed number  ge is required to issue to mesa a credit for the number of events less than the fixed number multiplied by an agreed upon price 
to the extent that the number of actual overhauls is greater than the fixed number  mesa is required to pay ge for the number of events greater than the fixed number multiplied by the same agreed upon price 
in april  the company entered into a year engine maintenance contract with pratt whitney canada corp 
pwc for its dash aircraft 
the contract requires mesa to pay pwc for the engine overhaul upon completion of the maintenance based upon a fixed dollar amount per flight hour 
the rate under the contract is subject to escalation based on changes in certain price indices 
maintenance expense is recognized in the period the maintenance is performed 
in april  the company entered into a year engine maintenance contract with rolls royce allison rolls royce for its erj aircraft 
the contract requires mesa to pay rolls royce for the engine overhaul upon completion of the maintenance based upon a fixed dollar amount per flight hour 
the rate per flight hour is based upon certain operational assumptions and may vary if the engines are operated differently than these assumptions 
the rate is also subject to escalation based on changes in certain price indices 
maintenance expense is recognized in the period the maintenance is performed 
the agreement with rolls royce also contains a termination clause and look back provision to provide for any shortfall between

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and short term marketable investment portfolio

a change in interest rates would result in an approximately million impact on interest expense 
the company also has investments in debt securities 
if short term interest rates were to average more than they did in fiscal year interest income would be impacted by approximately million 
the company s investments in equity securities are subject to market risk related to fluctuations in share prices for those shares held

we have exposure to certain market risks associated with our aircraft fuel 
aviation fuel expense is a significant expense for any air carrier and even marginal changes in the cost of fuel greatly impact a carrier s profitability 
standard industry contracts do not generally provide protection against fuel price increases  nor do they insure availability of supply

in fiscal  of our fuel requirements were associated with these contracts 
each one cent change in the price of jet fuel amounts to a million change in annual fuel costs for that portion of fuel expense that is not reimbursed by our code share partners
