due to the life protecting nature of many of our products  end users prefer to purchase innovative premium products with well known brand names with quality reputations that perform at a high level 
the strength of our brand names has contributed to our leading market positions in several of the product categories in which we compete 
strong client base and extensive distribution network 
armor holdings products has a broad  full service network of approximately domestic distributors and international agents to sell our portfolio of manufactured law enforcement equipment 
the quality and scope of our products and the strength of our brand names have enabled us to establish one of the largest distribution networks in the industry and engendered the loyalty of our distributors 
we work closely with our distributors and agents to respond to and anticipate the needs of end users  allowing us to maintain our market leadership position 
the diversity of our markets we serve  and the strength of our distribution relationships minimize our dependence on any particular product  market  or customer 
organizational experience identifying  completing and integrating acquisitions 
since january  we have completed acquisitions in our products and mobile security divisions 
we employ a disciplined value oriented approach to evaluating strategic acquisition opportunities and integrating the operations of acquired businesses 
these acquisitions  in the aggregate  have strengthened our market position  leveraged our distribution network and expanded our product and service offerings 
sole source provider of up armored hmmwvs 
through our armor mobile security division  we are the sole source provider of up armored hmmwvs to the us military 
we are also a subcontractor for the us army high mobility artillery rocket system himars program currently in development to produce an armored cab for the vehicle 
the armor mobile security division delivered hmmwvs in and hmmwvs in we believe this growth was driven by increased deployments of military police and security forces to high risk areas such as bosnia  kosovo and afghanistan and the potential of a long term  multi front offensive against terrorism 
we also provide aftermarket sales of spare parts and services maintenance  as the incumbent provider of an installed base of over  up armored hmmwvs 
growth strategy we believe the demand for security products and vehicle armor systems will continue to grow 
we expect to address this growth by offering a comprehensive array of high quality branded security products to meet the needs of law enforcement and militaries around the globe 
we also expect to continue to develop ballistic and blast protection for high end commercial vehicles as well as for military vehicles 
we intend to enhance our leadership position through additional strategic acquisitions by creating a broad portfolio of products and services to satisfy all of our customers increasingly complex security products needs 
the following elements define our growth strategy capitalize on exposure to military programs 
we believe the events of september   the subsequent war on terrorism  the increasing likelihood of military conflicts abroad  and recent actual events in saving lives through the performance of armor systems such as the hmmwv are all likely to result in additional interest by the department of defense 
we expect that several of our military programs may be positively affected 
these include the concealable body armor program through which we supply concealable body armor to the us army and the special operations forces personal equipment advanced requirements spear program  which supplies special ballistic vests and load bearing equipment to us special forces 
we are the sole source provider to the us military for the supply of armor and blast protection to the hmmwvs 
we belive we are well positioned on these programs and are bidding on several others 
additionally  we expect to participate in future military programs that require our unique products and services 
expand distribution network and product offerings 
we expect to continue to leverage our distribution network by expanding our range of branded law enforcement equipment through the acquisition of niche defensive security products manufacturers and by investing in the development of new and enhanced products which complement our existing offerings 
a broader product line will strengthen our relationships with distributors and enhance our brand appeal with military  law enforcement and other end users 
capitalize on increased homeland security requirements 
while homeland security spending is still not fully defined and in many cases has not yet reached down to the first responder  police officer level  we believe we are well positioned to provide products  services and specialized training essential to establishing a sustainable homeland security infrastructure 
after the september  terrorist attacks on the united states  the us government has created the department of homeland security 
we believe that we are well equipped and prepared to help build the infrastructure the department of homeland security is expected to develop 
our armor holdings products division is positioned to provide products that additional military  law enforcement  security and corrections personnel require to combat terrorism and threats to our homeland 
our armor mobile security division has the capacity to respond to an increase in demand for armored commercial vehicles for use by federal  state and local government agencies 
pursue strategic acquisitions 
we selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that complement and or expand our product offerings  provide access to new geographic markets  and provide additional distribution channels and new customer relationships 
acquisitions since we have pursued a strategy of growth thru acquisition by acquiring businesses and assets that complement our existing operations 
we use several criteria to evaluate prospective acquisitions  including whether the business to be acquired o broadens the scope of products we offer or the geographic areas we serve  o offers attractive margins  o is accretive to earnings  o offers opportunity to improve profitability by increasing the efficiency of our operations  o is managed in a manner consistent with our existing businesses  and o complements our portfolio of existing businesses by increasing our ability to meet our customers needs 
we exercise a high degree of financial discipline and strictly adhere to these criteria 
as a result  we do not enter into transactions that we believe would be dilutive to our earnings per share 
since january  we have consummated acquisitions in our products and mobile security divisions 
the armor holdings products division has acquired companies since the safariland acquisition completed by the products division in  a producer of law enforcement products such as body armor  duty gear  and automotive accessories in safariland had approximately million in annual revenues at the time of acquisition

armor mobile security we provide ballistic and blast protection armoring systems for military vehicles  commercial vehicles  military aircraft  and missile components  including the following military products 
we are the sole source provider to the us military for the supply of armoring and blast protection systems for the hmmwv 
the hmmwv chassis is produced by am general corporation and shipped directly to our facility in fairfield  ohio  where armor and blast protection components are added 
the up armored hmmwvs provide exterior protection against various levels of armor piercing ammunition  overhead airburst protection and underbody blast protection against anti tank and anti personnel mines 
in addition  we install other features designed to enhance crew safety  comfort and performance  such as air conditioning  weapon turrets and mounts  door locks and shock absorbing seats 
we charge  to  for these ballistic and blast protective systems 
during  the armor mobile security division shipped up armored hmmwvs 
we also supply engineering design and prototype services in support of the up armored hmmwv program  and supply spare parts and logistical support 
we are serving as a subcontractor for the u 
s 
army to supply a ballistically armored and sealed truck cab for the high mobility artillery rocket system himars  a program recently transitioned by the us army from developmental to low rate initial production quantities for delivery scheduled in late the truck is used to fire missiles which are a part of either the multiple launch rocket system or the army tactical missile system 
this program consisted of shipping seven prototypes in and two in for test and evaluation by the us army and us marine corps 
the program is currently approved for a low rate initial production in we market armor sub systems for other tactical wheeled vehicles  such as medium and heavy military trucks 
we also produce various armor systems as a subcontractor to a number of large defense contractors 
these products include armor for containers for fuels and missile launchers and for pilot protection  and often involve the use of unique materials or methods 
commercial products 
we armor a variety of vehicles  including limousines  sedans  sport utility vehicles  commercial trucks and cash in transit vehicles  to protect against varying degrees of ballistic and blast threats 
the commercial vehicle armoring process begins with the disassembly of a new base vehicle 
this disassembly normally involves the removal of the interior trim  seats  doors and windows 
the passenger compartment then is armored with both opaque and transparent armor 
other features  such as run flat tires and non exploding gas tanks  may also be added 
finally  the vehicle is reassembled as close to its original appearance as possible 
the entire conversion process results in an low profile  integrated ballistic protective system 
our relationship with various vehicle manufacturers has been valuable in permitting us to armor certain vehicles while allowing the customer to maintain the benefits of warranties issued by the vehicle manufacturer 
the armor mobile security division shipped  commercial armored vehicles in we produce fully armored vehicles and light armored vehicles 
fully armored commercial vehicles  such as limousines  large sedans or sport utility vehicles  typically are armored to protect against attacks from military assault rifles such as ak s and ms 
these vehicles also can be blast protected by enhancing the ballistic and underbody protection with proprietary materials and installation methods that protect the occupants against a defined blast threat 
blast protected vehicles defend against threats such as pipe bombs attached to the exterior of the vehicle and non directional charges of kg of tnt detonated approximately five meters from the vehicle 
fully armored vehicles typically sell for  to  exclusive of the cost of the base vehicle 
fully armored vehicles also include parade cars  which are formal limousines used predominantly for official functions by a president or other head of state 
these vehicles are usually customized based upon a commercially available chassis  which we essentially rebuild completely 
because the threat of organized assassination attempts is greater for heads of state  these vehicles normally incorporate more advanced armor and sophisticated protection features 
these features can include supplemental air and oxygen systems  air purification systems to protect against chemical or biological contamination  underbody fire suppressant systems  tear gas launchers  anti explosive self sealing fuel tanks  electric deadbolt door locks  gun ports and bomb scanners 
parade cars normally sell for  to in excess of million  inclusive of the cost of the base vehicle 
light armored vehicles are similar in all respects to fully armored vehicles except that we add substantially less total weight to a light armored vehicle 
therefore  it is possible to armor smaller vehicles such as the volkswagen jetta and the general motors omega  as well as larger vehicles such as the mercedes benz s and the jeep grand cherokee 
light armored vehicles are designed to protect against attacks from handguns  such as a mm or 
magnum 
the price of a light armored vehicle ranges from  to  exclusive of the cost of the base vehicle 
we also produce specialty vehicles and cash in transit vehicles 
specialty vehicles are custom built for a specific mission 
examples of specialty vehicles are escort cars  usually convertibles  and chase cars  usually closed top vehicles  in which security personnel ride while in a head of state motorcade 
cash in transit vehicles are used by banks or other businesses to transport currency and other valuables 
after starting with a van or small truck  we modify the base vehicle to provide protection for the cargo and passengers from ballistic and blast threats 
customers armor holdings products 
in  we sold approximately of our products in north america  with the balance sold internationally 
the primary end users of our products are federal  state and local law enforcement agencies  local police departments  state corrections facilities  us and allied militaries  highway patrols and sheriffs departments

armor mobile security division 
in  we sold approximately of our products in north america  with the balance sold internationally 
the market for military hardware products is worldwide in scope  including the us military and foreign defense forces 
the primary contract for delivery of up armored hmmwvs is with the us military 
we also serve as a subcontractor to provide ballistically armored and sealed truck cabs for high mobility artillery rocket system himars for use by the us army and the us marines corps  a program recently transitioned to low rate initial production 
additionally  we provide protected container systems  typically used to protect missile systems from small arms fire  to the us military under a subcontract to a major defense contractor 
our armored commercial vehicle customers include governmental and private buyers 
us and foreign governmental buyers purchase both fully and light armored vehicles 
governmental buyers also comprise the market for parade cars 
typically  governmental buyers consist of ministries of foreign affairs  defense and internal affairs and offices of presidential security 
these customers are not constrained in their purchasing decisions by considerations such as import duties and taxes and are free to search globally for the best product available 
the procurement cycles of governmental buyers can range from relatively rapid  when the vehicles are for the use of the head of state or in response to a particular crisis  to prolonged highly documented bids and evaluations for normally budgeted items 
private customers for armored commercial vehicles include corporations and individuals 
private buyers are much more sensitive to price  of which import duties and taxes may be a substantial part  and  therefore  often will buy a locally produced product  if one exists that meets their needs 
local servicing of the vehicle is also a critical concern to private buyers 
customers for cash in transit vehicles are generally companies which provide cash in transit services to financial institutions 
purchasing decisions for cash in transit vehicles depend on many criteria including insurance  regulatory requirements and costs  and depend on whether the financial institution is private or governmental 
there are no customers who accounted for more than of net sales of the armor holdings products division during our fiscal year ended december  fiscal 
our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of total sales for fiscal approximately of the armor mobile security division s net sales for fiscal were derived from us military contracts  and an additional were derived from commercial contracts with non military us governmental agencies and foreign governments 
military and governmental contracts generally are awarded on a periodic or sporadic basis 
if the armor mobile security division were to lose the hmmwv contract  which continues through june  the division s financial performance would experience a materially negative impact

critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  the use of estimates  income taxes and impairment 
revenue recognition 
we record products revenue at the time of shipment 
returns are minimal and do not materially affect the financial statements 
we record revenue from our mobile security division when the vehicle is shipped  except for larger commercial contracts typically longer than four months in length and the contract for the delivery of hmmwvs to the us government  which continues through revenue from such larger contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion  units of work performed method 
hmmwv units sold to the us government are considered complete when the onsite department of defense officer finishes the inspection of the hmmwv and approves it for delivery 
should such contracts be in a loss position  the entire estimated loss would be recognized for the balance of the contract at such time 
we believe that our current contracts are profitable 
we record service revenue as services are provided on a contract by contract basis 
revenues from service contracts are recognized over the term of the contract 
estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements include periodic testing of the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment  valuation allowances for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  liabilities for potential litigation claims and settlements  and contract contingencies and obligations 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method specified thereunder  deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax liabilities are offset by deferred tax assets relating to net operating loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences 
future benefits obtained either from utilization of net operating loss carryforwards or from the reduction in the income tax asset valuation allowance existing on september  have been and will be applied to reduce reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets 
at december  and  our consolidated foreign subsidiaries have unremitted earnings of approximately million and million  respectively on which the company has not recorded a provision for united states federal income taxes since these earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested 
such foreign earnings have been taxed according to the regulations existing in the countries in which they were earned 
impairment 
long lived assets including certain identifiable intangibles  and the goodwill related to those assets  are reviewed annually for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset in question may not be recoverable including  but not limited to  a deterioration of profits for a business segment that has long lived assets  and when other changes occur which might impair recovery of long lived assets 
management has reviewed the company s long lived assets and has taken an impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value of the services division to estimated realizable value 
the method used to determine the existence of an impairment would be discounted operating cash flows estimated over the remaining useful lives of the related long lived assets for continuing operations in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
impairment is measured as the difference between fair value and unamortized cost at the date impairment is determined 
discontinued operations 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  a component classified as held for sale is reported in discontinued operations when the following conditions are met a the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity as a result of the disposal transaction and b the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction 
in a period in which a component of an entity either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale  the income statement for current and prior periods reports the results of operations of the component  including any estimated impairment gain or loss recognized in accordance with sfas paragraph  in discontinued operations 
the results of discontinued operations  less applicable income taxes benefit  is reported as a separate component of income before extraordinary items and the cumulative effect of accounting changes if applicable 
the assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale is presented separately in the asset and liability sections  respectively  of the statement of financial position 
results of operations effective june   we decided to sell the armorgroup services division through an organized and formal auction managed by outside advisors 
in accordance with statement of accounting standards  accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the assets and liabilities of the company s services division are classified as held for sale  with its operating results reported as discontinued operations in our statement of operations for all periods 
our us based training subsidiary  usds  inc previously reported under the services division but not included for sale has been reclassified to the products division

income from continuing operations and the loss from discontinued operations was million and million respectively for fiscal  compared to income from continuing operations of million and a loss from discontinued operations of million for fiscal the increase in income from continuing operations relates primarily to the inclusion of the mobile security division for a full year in versus four months in continuing operations armor holdings products revenues 
our armor holdings products division revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal for fiscal  products division revenue increased internally  including year over year changes in acquired businesses  and due to a series of small strategic tuck in acquisitions including identicator  inc identicator  guardian personal security products  inc guardian  speedfeed  inc 
speedfeed  the foldable products group foldable  evi paq  inc evi paq b square  inc 
b square and emergency products 
products division revenues include million and million from usds  inc  our us based training company  for the years ended fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in our filings prior to june   we reported usds  inc as a part of our services division 
mobile security division revenues 
our armor mobile security division revenues increased million  or to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal revenues for fiscal  included only four months of operations after the acquisitions of o gara hess eisenhardt armoring company  the o gara company  and o gara security associates  inc in august  revenues in fiscal includes million related to the acquisition of trasco bremen in september including the eight months of operations prior to our ownership and excluding all revenue associated with assets that we either did not purchase or sold  mobile security division revenue increased internally from approximately million during fiscal cost of sales 
cost of sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was due primarily to the acquisition of the armor mobile security division as well as overall revenue growth for fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  cost of sales increased to of total revenues for fiscal from for fiscal this increase as a percentage of total revenues was partially due to the full year inclusion in of the mobile security division  which operates at lower average gross margins than the products division and partially to reduced products division margins as discussed below 
for fiscal  gross margins in the products division were compared to reported in the same period last year  while the gross margins in the mobile security division were in fiscal  compared to for the four months of the december  fiscal year after the acquisition date 
the products division consists of a portfolio of law enforcement products  each of which is manufactured and sold at different margins 
in any given period  the products division weighted average gross margins will fluctuate based upon the relative volume of products sold during the period 
lower gross margins during fiscal in the products division were partially attributable to product mix  as well as to short term increases in manufacturing costs and a raw material supply issues in the division s body armor operations during the first half of during late and  the products division combined its jacksonville  florida based body armor operation into its body armor manufacturing facility in ontario  california 
during  the division experienced difficulty in this combination resulting in capacity constraints and increased manufacturing costs 
we believe that these capacity constraints have been alleviated and that certain of our body armor manufacturing costs will decrease during the first half of however  during this time  we also experienced interruptions in the supply of zylon shield  a certain ballistic fiber used in our leading concealable ballistic vest 
this particular supply problem was related to the ballistic integrity of the fiber we received and not the actual availability of the material 
nevertheless  our inability to receive quality zylon shield during this period exacerbated our capacity constraints 
as of december   the division is currently receiving adequate supplies of zylon shield and is currently working to decrease its body armor manufacturing costs 
the products division gross margins also decreased because it realized higher proportional revenue increases from its training division  which operates at significantly lower overall gross margins than its manufacturing segment 
the decrease in gross margins in the mobile security division was primarily due to a less favorable mix of commercial vehicle sales compared to the same period the prior year  a heavier mix of lower margin cash in transit vehicles in compared to  and a larger number of base unit sales included in revenue in the period 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million  or  to million of total revenues for fiscal compared to million of total revenues for fiscal this increase was primarily due to the operating expenses associated with the operations of the mobile security division  acquired in august  which were not included for the full year ended december  operating expenses also increased in the products division primarily due to operating expenses associated with acquired companies and from internal growth of the business 
operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased because the mobile security division operates with a lower level of operating expenses as a percentage of sales than does the products division 
we expect to see an increase in corporate operating expense during because we will incur significant increases in insurance expenses  government affairs and lobbying efforts  internal audit  information technology and increased legal and accounting costs associated with legal compliance 
amortization 
amortization expense decreased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this decrease results from the implementation of sfas  which eliminated goodwill amortization for all acquisitions completed after july   as well as for all fiscal years ending after january  remaining amortization expense is related to patents and trademarks with finite lives 
integration and other non recurring charges 
integration and other non recurring charges increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal these charges relate primarily to the integration of the mobile security division  as well as other acquisitions completed in and integration and other non recurring charges also included certain expenses related to the integration of our body armor operations  as well as direct costs and expenses associated with potential acquisitions that did not close

provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the provision for income taxes for fiscal included charges of approximately million related to the establishment of valuation allowances for certain foreign deferred tax assets of our discontinued operations 
the effect of these charges was to increase our effective tax rate for fiscal to compared to for fiscal without these charges  our effective tax rate for fiscal would have been 
the increase in what our effective tax rate would have been without the tax charges related to our discontinued operations is due primarily to the higher percentage of income earned in the united states and the impact of state income taxes on this income 
our expected effective tax rate is not necessarily indicative of what our actual effective rate will be due to the changing concentration and mix of income in the various countries in which we continue to operate 
income from continuing operations

in our filings prior to june   we reported usds  inc as a part of the service division 
not including these acquisitions  the armor holdings product division revenue decreased during fiscal  due in part to shipping interruptions and order cancellations that resulted from the september terrorist attacks against the world trade center and the pentagon and to a slowdown in purchasing during the first quarter of we attribute a portion of the first quarter slowdown with the bulletproof vest partnership act the bvp money that provides federal matching funds to law enforcement agencies purchasing bullet resistant vests

if a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the period the asset retirement obligation is incurred  the liability shall be recognized when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is the amount at which that liability could be settled in a current transaction between willing parties  that is  other than in a forced or liquidation transaction

inflation we believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation in recent years have not had a significant impact on our revenue or profitability 
historically  we have been able to offset any inflationary effects by either increasing prices or improving cost efficiencies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our global operating and financial activities  we are exposed to changes in raw material prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  we manage exposure to changes in raw material prices  interest rates  and foreign currency exchange rates through our regular operating and financing activities 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we utilize leveraged financial instruments or other derivatives for such purposes 
market rate risk the following discussion about our market rate risk involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity security price risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge these risks 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to borrowings under our credit facilities and our short term monetary investments 
to the extent that  from time to time  we hold short term money market instruments  there is a market rate risk for changes in interest rates on such instruments 
to that extent  there is inherent rollover risk in the short term money market instruments as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
however  there is no risk of loss of principal in the short term money market instruments  only a risk related to a potential reduction in future interest income 
derivative instruments are not presently used to adjust our interest rate risk profile 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge this interest rate risk 
however  in the future  we may consider the use of financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk 
on december   we sold a put option on  shares to an institutional counterparty with an exercise price of per share and an expiration date of march  for  we have a maximum potential obligation under the put options to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of for an aggregate of million 
although certain other events can trigger exercise these put options are generally excercisable only at maturity on march  we have the right to settle the put options by cash settlement  physical settlement of the options or by net share settlement using shares of our common stock 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 we have recorded the sale of the put options in equity and as such  changes in fair value of the options have not been recognized in the financial statements 
we may  from time to time  enter into additional put and call option arrangements 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the majority of our business is denominated in us dollars 
there are costs associated with our operations in foreign countries that require payments in the local currency 
where appropriate and to partially manage our foreign currency risk related to those payments we receive payment from customers in local currencies in amounts sufficient to meet our local currency obligations 
we do not use derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge foreign currency risk 
risks associated with international operations we have business operations in numerous countries  including emerging markets in africa  asia and south america 
we have invested substantial resources outside of the united states and plan to continue to do so in the future 
our international operations are subject to the risk of new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions  tariffs and trade barriers  potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations  potential imposition of restrictions on investments  potentially adverse tax consequences  including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  and local economic  political and social conditions 
governments of many developing countries have exercised and continue to exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector 
government actions in the future could have a significant adverse effect on economic conditions in a developing country or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on us and our operating companies 
we do not have political risk insurance in the countries in which we currently conducts business  but periodically analyze the need for and cost associated with this type of policy 
moreover  applicable agreements relating to our interests in our operating companies are frequently governed by foreign law 
as a result  in the event of a dispute  it may be difficult for us to enforce our rights 
accordingly  we may have little or no recourse upon the occurrence of any of these developments
