this discussion should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included or incorporated by reference elsewhere in this document 
overview the company was formed in february for the purpose of organizing quad city bank trust and has grown to million in consolidated assets as of december  management expects continued opportunities for growth  even though the rate of growth may be slower than that experienced to date 
the company reported earnings of million or basic earnings per share for the six month transition period ended december  as compared to million or basic earnings per share for fiscal  million and basic earnings per share for fiscal  and million and basic earnings per share for fiscal the sale of bancard s iso related merchant credit card operations to ipayment  inc in october  was a significant contributor to the increase in earnings for the six months ended december  when compared to the same period in the increase in fiscal earnings from fiscal was attributable primarily to significant increases in both net interest income and noninterest income  partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense 
the decrease in fiscal earnings from fiscal was attributable to an increase in noninterest expense partially offset by increases in both noninterest income and net interest income 
when compared to the same period in  the six months ended december  reflected significant growth in both net interest income and noninterest income for the company 
for the period  net interest income and noninterest income improved by and  respectively  for a combined increase of million when compared to the six months ended december  both quad city bank trust and cedar rapids bank trust generated marked improvement in net interest margin  as well as increases in the gains on sales of residential real estate loans for the period 
the sale of the iso related merchant credit card portfolio at bancard contributed million of noninterest income 
offsetting these revenue improvements for the company were increases in noninterest expense of million and the provision for loan losses of million 
the primary contributors to the increase in noninterest expense were contractual compensation and severance payments at bancard and allied resulting from the sale of the iso related merchant credit card operations 
for the six months ended december   operating costs associated with cedar rapids bank trust were approximately million as compared to million for the same period in while the after tax start up losses at cedar rapids bank trust were thousand for the six months ended december   these losses were less than anticipated  and cedar rapids bank and trust s growth was more rapid than expected 
management remains confident that the cedar rapids operations will provide significant long term benefits to the company 
the company s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income  principally from loans and investment securities  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  net interest spread and net interest margin 
volume refers to the average dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin refers to the net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company s average tax equivalent yield on interest earning assets decreased for the six months ended december  as compared to the same period in with the same comparison  the average cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased  which resulted in a increase in the net interest spread of at december  compared to at december  the relative stability in the net interest spread from year to year also carried over to the net interest margin 
for the six months ended december   net interest margin was compared to for the like period in management continues to closely monitor and manage net interest margin 
from a profitability standpoint  an important challenge for the subsidiary banks in the near term is to maintain their net interest margins 
however  very competitive local loan rate environments have resulted in the subsidiary banks interest margins being below their national peer groups 
management continues to address this issue with alternative funding sources and pricing strategies 
the company s operating results are also affected by sources of noninterest income  including merchant credit card fees  trust fees  deposit service charge fees  gains from the sales of residential real estate loans and other income 
operating expenses of the company include employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment expense and other administrative expenses 
the company s operating results are also affected by economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
the majority of the subsidiary banks loan portfolios are invested in commercial loans 
deposits from commercial customers represent a significant funding source as well 
the company has added facilities and employees to accommodate both its historical growth and anticipated future growth 
as such  overhead expenses have had a significant impact on earnings 
this trend is likely to continue as cedar rapids bank trust moved to its permanent facility in the fall of  and both banks continue to add the facilities and resources necessary to attract and serve additional customers during  quad city bank trust began to develop internally a merchant credit card processing operation and in transferred this function to bancard  a separate subsidiary of the company 
bancard initially had an arrangement to provide processing services exclusively to customers of a single independent sales organization or iso 
this iso was sold in  and the purchaser requested a reduction in the term of the contract 
bancard agreed to amend the contract to reduce the term and accept a fixed monthly processing fee of thousand for merchants existing at the time the agreement was signed  and a lower transaction fee for new merchants  in exchange for a payment of million  the ability to transact business with other isos and the assumption of the credit risk by the iso 
approximately two thirds of the income from this settlement  or million  was reported in fiscal  with the remainder of thousand being recognized during fiscal bancard terminated its processing for this iso in may  eliminating approximately of its average monthly processing volume 
prior to this iso s termination  bancard s average monthly processing volume for fiscal was million 
during both fiscal and  bancard worked to establish additional iso relationships and further develop the relationships with existing isos successfully rebuilding and expanding processing volumes 
bancard s average monthly dollar volume of transactions processed during fiscal was million 
during fiscal  the average monthly dollar volume of transactions processed by bancard increased to million 
monthly processing volumes at bancard during fiscal climbed to a level above that existing prior to the termination of all processing with the initial iso 
on october   the company announced bancard s sale of its iso related merchant credit card operations to ipayment  inc for million 
after contractual compensation and severance payments  transaction expenses  and income taxes  the transaction resulted in a net gain of million  or per share  which was realized during the quarter ended december  also included in the sale  were all of the merchant credit card processing relationships owned by bancard s subsidiary  allied 
bancard will continue to provide credit card processing for its local merchants and cardholders of the subsidiary banks and agent banks 
it is anticipated that the company s termination of iso related merchant credit card processing will reduce bancard s future earnings 
however  the company believes that bancard can be profitable with its narrowed business focus of providing credit card processing for its local merchants and agent banks and for cardholders of the company s subsidiary banks 
currently  bancard continues to process transactions for ipayment  inc  but it is anticipated that this activity will cease in the near future 
during fiscal  quad city bank trust expanded its presence in the mortgage banking market by hiring several experienced loan originators and an experienced underwriter  and now has seven loan originators on staff 
cedar rapids bank trust currently has one mortgage loan originator 
quad city bank trust and cedar rapids bank trust originate mortgage loans on personal residences and sell the majority of these loans into the secondary market to avoid the interest rate risk associated with long term fixed rate financing 
the subsidiary banks realize revenue from this mortgage banking activity from a combination of loan origination fees and gains on the sale of the loans in the secondary market 
during the six months ended december   the subsidiary banks originated million of real estate loans and sold million  or  of these loans resulting in gains of million 
during fiscal  the subsidiary banks originated million of real estate loans and sold million  or  of these loans  which resulted in gains of million 
the depressed interest rates during these periods have caused a significant increase in the subsidiary banks mortgage origination volume 
in fiscal  quad city bank trust originated million of real estate loans and sold million  or  of these loans resulting in gains of million 
trust department income continues to be a significant contributor to noninterest income 
in the six months ended december   trust department fees contributed million in revenues 
trust department fees grew from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and to million in fiscal income is generated primarily from fees charged based on assets under administration for corporate and personal trusts and for custodial services 
at december   assets under administration were million 
the decrease of million in trust assets from june to december  was a reflection of the reduced market values of securities held in trust accounts 
primarily the result of new trust relationships  assets under administration had grown from at june  to million at june the company s initial public offering during the fourth calendar quarter of raised approximately million 
in order to provide additional capital to support the growth of quad city bank trust  the company formed a statutory business trust  which issued million of capital securities to the public for cash in june in conjunction with the formation of cedar rapids bank trust  the company sold approximately million of its common stock through a private placement offering in september  primarily to investors in the cedar rapids area 
critical accounting policy the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the financial information contained within these statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
based on its consideration of accounting policies that involve the most complex and subjective decisions and assessments  management has identified its most critical accounting policy to be that related to the allowance for loan losses 
the company s allowance for loan loss methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations  both quantitative and qualitative in establishing an allowance for loan loss that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date 
quantitative factors include the company s historical loss experience  delinquency and charge off trends  collateral values  changes in nonperforming loans  and other factors 
quantitative factors also incorporate known information about individual loans  including borrowers sensitivity to interest rate movements 
qualitative factors include the general economic environment in the company s markets  including economic conditions throughout the midwest and in particular  the state of certain industries 
size and complexity of individual credits in relation to loan structure  existing loan policies and pace of portfolio growth are other qualitative factors that are considered in the methodology 
as the company adds new products and increases the complexity of its loan portfolio  it will enhance its methodology accordingly 
management may report a materially different amount for the provision for loan losses in the statement of operations to change the allowance for loan losses if its assessment of the above factors were different 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere herein  as well as the portion of this management s discussion and analysis section entitled financial condition allowance for loan losses 
although management believes the levels of the allowance as of december  and both june  and were adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio  a decline in local economic conditions  or other factors  could result in increasing losses that cannot be reasonably predicted at this time 
results of operations six months ended december  compared with six months ended december  overview 
net income for the six months ended december  was million as compared to net income of million for the six month period ended december  for an increase of million or 
basic earnings per share for the six month period ended december  were as compared to for the comparable period in the increase in net income was comprised of an increase in net interest income after provision for loan losses of million and an increase in noninterest income of million  partially offset by increases in noninterest expenses of million and an increase in federal and state income taxes of million 
several specific factors contributed to the improvement in net income from to for the six month periods 
primary factors included the million gain on sale of the merchant credit card portfolio  a improvement in net interest margin prompted by increased volumes  and a increase in gains on sales of real estate loans 
interest income 
interest income grew from million for the six months ended december  to million for the comparable period in the increase in interest income was attributable to greater average outstanding balances in interest earning assets  principally loans receivable  partially offset by a decrease in interest rates 
the average yield on interest earning assets for the six months ended december  was as compared to for the six month period ended december  interest expense 
interest expense decreased by thousand  from million for the six months ended december  to million for the same period in the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to a reduction in interest rates almost entirely offset by greater average outstanding balances in interest bearing liabilities 
the average cost on interest bearing liabilities was for the six months ended december  as compared to for the like period in provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is established based on a number of factors  including the local and national economy and the risk associated with the loans in the portfolio 
the company had an allowance for estimated losses on loans of approximately of total gross loans at december   as compared to approximately at june  and at december  the provision for loan losses increased by million  from million for the six months ended december  to million for the six month period ended december  during the period  management made monthly provisions for loan losses based upon a number of factors  principally the increase in loans and a detailed analysis of the loan portfolio 
during the six months ended december   thousand  or  of the provision for loan losses resulted from the deterioration of a single  significant loan relationship at quad city bank and trust 
for the six month period ended december   commercial loans had total  net charge offs of million 
the charge off of a single commercial loan relationship at quad city bank and trust accounted for million  or  of the commercial loan charge offs for the period 
consumer loan charge offs and recoveries totaled thousand and thousand  respectively  for the six months ended december  real estate loans had no charge off or recovery activity during this period in the ability to grow profitably is  in part  dependent upon the ability to maintain asset quality 
noninterest income 
noninterest income increased by million from million for the six months ended december  to million for the same period in in the six months ended december   the primary component of the increase in noninterest income was the gain on sale of the iso related portion of the merchant credit card portfolio of million  which accounted for of the increase 
noninterest income for both periods consisted of income from the merchant credit card operation  fees from the trust department  depository service fees  gains on the sale of residential real estate mortgage loans  and other miscellaneous fees 
also making significant contributions to the increase in noninterest income from year to year were increases in gains on sales of loans and merchant credit card fees net of processing costs 
during the six month period ended december   merchant credit card fees net of processing costs  increased by thousand to million  from million for the comparable period in the increase was due to a improvement from year to year in the volume of credit card transactions processed during the six months ended december during the six month period ended december   bancard processed million of transactions  which grew to million for the same period in as a result of the sale of the iso related merchant credit card operations  processing volumes are expected to decrease dramatically in future months 
bancard will operate with a narrowed focus of processing for its local merchants and agent banks and for cardholders of the company s subsidiary banks 
for the six month periods ended both december  and  trust department fees were million 
the thousand  or  increase from year to year was primarily a reflection of the further development of existing trust relationships and the addition of new trust relationships during the period  almost entirely offset by the reduced market value of securities held in trust accounts and the resulting impact on the calculation of trust fees 
gains on sales of loans were million for the six months ended december   which reflected an increase of  or thousand  from million for the like period in the increase resulted from the decline in mortgage rates during calendar year this situation created significantly more home refinances during the period and the subsequent sale of the majority of these loans into the secondary market 
because the gains on sales of loans have an indirect relationship with interest and mortgage rates  it is unlikely that the subsidiary banks will continue to maintain this level of activity in the long term 
the million gain on sale of merchant credit card portfolio made the most significant contribution to the increase in noninterest income for the six months ended december  over the comparable period in in october  the company sold bancard s iso related merchant credit card operations to ipayment  inc also included in the sale were all of the merchant credit card processing relationships owned by allied

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to direct and indirect market risk 
direct market risk exists from changes in interest rates 
the company s net income is dependent on its net interest income 
net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis than interest earning assets 
when interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a given period  a significant increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income 
similarly  when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  falling interest rates could result in a decrease in net income 
in an attempt to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  management monitors the company s interest rate risk 
each subsidiary bank has an asset liability management committee of the board of directors that meets quarterly to review the bank s interest rate risk position and profitability  and to make or recommend adjustments for consideration by the full board of each bank 
management also reviews quad city bank trust and cedar rapids bank trust s securities portfolios  formulates investment strategies  and oversees the timing and implementation of transactions to assure attainment of the board s objectives in the most effective manner 
notwithstanding the company s interest rate risk management activities  the potential for changing interest rates is an uncertainty that can have an adverse effect on net income 
in adjusting the company s asset liability position  the board and management attempt to manage the company s interest rate risk while maintaining or enhancing net interest margins 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long term and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  the board and management may decide to increase the company s interest rate risk position somewhat in order to increase its net interest margin 
the company s results of operations and net portfolio values remain vulnerable to increases in interest rates and to fluctuations in the difference between long term and short term interest rates 
one approach used to quantify interest rate risk is the net portfolio value analysis 
in essence  this analysis calculates the difference between the present value of liabilities and the present value of expected cash flows from assets and off balance sheet contracts 
the following table sets forth  at december  and june   an analysis of the company s interest rate risk as measured by the estimated changes in the net portfolio value resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve or basis points 
estimated increase change in decrease in npv interest estimated rates npv amount amount percent basis points dec  june  dec  june  dec  june  dollars in thousands the company does not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments to control interest rate risk 
even though such activities may be permitted with the approval of the board of directors  the company does not intend to engage in such activities in the immediate future 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the company 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities
