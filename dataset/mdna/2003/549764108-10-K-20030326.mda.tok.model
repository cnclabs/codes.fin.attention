as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated statements 
the company extends credit to customers in the normal course of business 
management performs ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
an allowance for doubtful accounts has been established to provide for estimated losses on receivable collections 
the balance of this allowance is determined by regular reviews of outstanding receivables and historical experience 
as the financial condition of customers change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
revenue is not recognized until it is realized or realizable and earned 
the criteria to meet this guideline are persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company also recognizes bill and hold transactions when the product is completed and is ready to be shipped and the risk of loss on the product has been transferred to the customer 
the company has made significant investments in inventory to service its customers 
on a routine basis  the company uses estimates in determining the level of reserves required to state inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management s estimates are primarily influenced by market activity levels  production requirements  the physical condition of products and technological innovation 
changes in any of these factors may result in adjustments to the carrying value of inventory 
also  the company accounts for a significant portion of its inventory under the lifo method 
the lifo reserve can be impacted by changes in the lifo layers and by inflation index adjustments 
long lived assets  including goodwill  held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be reasonable 
the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value can be recovered through projected discounted cash flows  based on expected future operating results 
future adverse market conditions or poor operating results could result in the inability to recover the current carrying value and thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the book basis and tax basis of the net assets of the company 
in providing for deferred taxes  management considers current tax regulations  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws as well as changes in the financial position of the company could also affect the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
if management estimates that some or all of any deferred tax assets will expire before realization or that the future deductibility is not probable  a valuation allowance would be recorded 
the company is subject to claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of business 
the company maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of its businesses and operations 
the company retains a portion of the insured losses that occur through the use of deductibles 
management regularly reviews estimates of reported and unreported insured and non insured claims and legal actions and provides for losses through reserves 
as circumstances develop and additional information becomes available  adjustments to loss reserves may be required 
the company sells certain of its products to customers with a product warranty that provides repairs at no cost to the customer or the issuance of credit to the customer 
the length of the warranty term depends on the product being sold  but ranges from one year to five years 
the company accrues its estimated exposure to warranty claims based upon historical warranty claim costs as a percentage of sales multiplied by prior sales still under warranty at the end of any period 
management reviews these estimates on a regular basis and adjusts the warranty provisions as actual experience differs from historical estimates or other information becomes available 
the company offers a defined benefit plan and other benefits upon the retirement of its employees 
assets and liabilities associated with these benefits are calculated by third party actuaries under the rules provided by various accounting standards  with certain estimates provided by management 
these estimates include the discount rate  expected rate of return of assets and the rate of increase of compensation and health claims 
on a regular basis  management reviews these estimates by comparing them to actual experience and those used by other companies 
if a change in an estimate is made  the carrying value of these assets and liabilities may have to be adjusted 
forward looking statements and assumptions this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements and information  within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  that are based on management s beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management 
when used in this report  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements reflect the company s current views with respect to certain events and are subject to certain assumptions  risks and uncertainties  many of which are outside the control of the company 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  i oil prices  ii capital spending levels of oil producers  iii availability and prices for raw materials and iv general industry and economic conditions 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those anticipated  believed  estimated or expected 
the company undertakes no obligations to update or revise its forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company s financial instruments include cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable  invested funds and debt obligations 
the book value of accounts receivable  short term debt and accounts payable are considered to be representative of their fair market value because of the short maturity of these instruments 
the company believes the carrying values of its long term debt obligations approximate fair values because the interest rates on these obligations are comparable to what the company believes it could currently obtain for debt with similar terms and maturities 
the company s accounts receivable are not concentrated in one customer or industry and are not viewed as an unusual credit risk
