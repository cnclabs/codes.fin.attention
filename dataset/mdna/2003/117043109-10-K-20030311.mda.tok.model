the reduction in sales  excluding acquisitions  was experienced across all reportable segments but was mainly attributed to lower sales in the boat and marine engine segments 
throughout  weakened market conditions adversely affected domestic marine sales  particularly small boats and engines 
fitness segment sales benefited from growth in the fitness equipment business internationally  but was partially offset by lower sales of consumer and commercial fitness equipment in the united states 
the bowling billiards segment sales were affected by the decrease in the sales of bowling capital equipment due to the economic recession 
international sales increased million to million in compared with million in sales in europe increased million  or percent  to million in  reflecting stronger sales of marine engine products and fitness equipment  which were partially offset by reduced sales of boats and bowling capital equipment

these higher shipments in were largely due to a change in the rate at which dealers and boatbuilders adjusted their engine inventories  rather than higher retail sales 
in  dealers and boatbuilders significantly reduced their wholesale purchases to lower their inventory levels 
reductions in dealer and boatbuilder inventories during occurred at a much lower rate 
improved pricing in the domestic market  increased parts and accessories sales  and an increase in international sales  due in part to favorable currency trends from a weakening us dollar  also helped drive sales growth in the marine engine segment in operating earnings for the segment decreased million  or percent  to million in  compared with operating margins as a percentage of sales fell basis points to percent when compared with the decline in operating earnings and margins in was primarily due to higher variable compensation  pension and insurance costs  and a change in the mix of product sold toward low emission two stroke and four stroke outboard engines  which carry lower profit margins

in  operating earnings for the segment decreased to million from million  and operating margins fell basis points to percent  compared with lower shipments combined with the lower absorption of fixed costs from reduced production rates and extended plant shutdowns were the primary driver for this decline in operating earnings 
an unfavorable shift in sales mix from higher margin sterndrive engines to lower margin outboard engines  along with an increase in lower margin international sales  also accounted for some of the margin pressure 
benefits from cost containment efforts  including reductions in performance based incentives and a reduction in salaried headcount  partially mitigated these factors 
boat segment the following table sets forth boat segment results dollars in millions net sales    percentage increase decrease operating earnings percentage increase decrease operating margin capital expenditures sales in the boat segment increased million  or percent  to  million in compared with the increase in sales was primarily due to a full year of sales from the acquisitions of princecraft  sealine and hatteras  which were completed in excluding these acquisitions  sales declined percent

boat segment operating earnings increased million to million compared with earnings contributions from acquisitions completed in and a reduction in operating losses from the boat segment s us marine division  discussed below  were largely offset by the reduction in sales of larger cruisers and yachts in operating margins in were adversely affected by the mix shift toward smaller boats  which carry lower margins 
in  boat segment sales totaled  million  a decrease of percent from excluding the acquisition of princecraft  sealine and hatteras  sales declined percent 
significantly reduced retail demand for smaller boats was a leading cause of the decline  although demand for larger cruisers and yachts also weakened in the second half of the year 
as retail sales of boats weakened  dealers started to lower their own inventories  further reducing wholesale demand 
boat segment operating earnings totaled million in  declining million from the prior year 
operating margins also declined  falling basis points to percent in the decline in operating earnings was primarily attributable to reduced sales and the operating losses experienced at the company s us marine division 
reduced absorption of fixed costs due to lower production and temporary shutdowns at the boat plants also impacted operating earnings 
a portion of the operating earnings decline was offset by efforts to enhance operating effectiveness  as well as reduced costs and decreased headcount 
the overall performance of the boat segment was adversely affected in both and by operations at the company s us marine division  which manufactures bayliner  maxum and meridian pleasure boats and trophy offshore fishing boats 
operating losses for the division were million and million for the years ended and  respectively  compared with operating earnings of million in in and  losses at us marine were primarily due to sales reductions  operating inefficiencies associated with shifting boat production from five facilities closed throughout to remaining manufacturing plants  the launch of the meridian yacht brand  and the start up of a new plant in mexico to manufacture small boats

international sales increased percent in compared with this increase related primarily to improved sales of commercial and consumer products despite adverse currency fluctuations 
the fitness segment reported operating earnings of million in compared with million in operating margins declined basis points to percent in the reduction in operating earnings reflected the lower absorption of fixed costs that resulted from temporary plant shutdowns necessary to adjust production rates

in its marine engine segment  the company will continue to develop engine technologies to reduce engine emissions to comply with present and future emissions requirements 
the costs associated with these activities and the introduction of low emission engines will have an adverse effect on marine engine segment operating margins and may affect short term operating results 
the boat segment continues to pursue fiberglass boat manufacturing technologies and techniques to reduce air emissions at its boat manufacturing facilities 
the company does not believe that compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws will have a material adverse effect on the company s competitive position 
see note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for disclosure of the potential cash requirements of environmental proceedings 
engine emission regulations us environmental protection agency epa regulations finalized in require that certain exhaust emissions from gasoline marine outboard engines be reduced by percent per year for nine years beginning with the model year 
the company has implemented a plan that meets the epa compliance schedule 
it includes modifying automotive two stroke direct fuel injection technology for marine use and substituting certain two stroke engines with four stroke engines 
both of these technologies yield emission reductions of percent or better 
the california air resources board carb voted to adopt regulations more stringent than the epa regulations 
these regulations accelerated the applicability of the epa targeted emissions reductions from to this affected new engines sold in california beginning with the model year  with further emission reductions scheduled in and the company met the requirements and believes that its current implementation plan designed to meet the epa exhaust emissions regulations will allow the company to comply with the more stringent regulations as currently proposed by carb 
the company expects the amount of low emission engine sales as a percentage of total marine engine segment sales to continue to increase and anticipates that it will continue to invest in development of low emission engine technologies 
effects of threatened european communities tariff increases on april   the commission of the european communities announced its intention to increase tariffs on certain us exports to the countries comprising the european communities ec  including many categories of recreational boats 
the proposed ec tariff increase was announced in response to increases by the united states on certain steel tariffs 
if the ec tariffs become effective  a substantial portion of the company s boats imported into the ec could be subject to an additional duty of up to percent 
the proposed tariffs are scheduled to become effective on march   or five days following a ruling from the world trade organization wto that the us steel tariffs are incompatible with wto standards  whichever is sooner 
a ruling from the wto is expected during  but the company is unable to predict what that ruling will be 
although it is not possible to determine the likely effects of the ec proposal  the company is carefully monitoring developments concerning this matter and will continue to evaluate potential strategies for mitigating any adverse effects of the proposed tariffs 
the company s sales of us produced boats into the ec during totaled approximately million

critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of reported assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the company discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and believes the following are the most critical accounting policies that could have an effect on the company s reported results 
revenue recognition and sales incentives 
the company s revenue is derived primarily from product sales 
revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the sale  primarily upon shipment to customers  once the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company offers discounts and sales incentives that include retail promotional activities  rebates and manufacturer coupons 
the estimated liability for sales incentives is recorded at the later of when the program has been communicated to the customer or at the time of sale in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of a vendor s products 
the liability is estimated based on the costs for the incentive program  the planned duration of the program and historical experience 
if actual costs are different from estimated costs  the liability could be affected 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company records an allowance for uncollectible receivables based upon past transaction history with customers  customer payment practices and economic conditions 
actual collection experience may differ from the current estimate of net receivables 
a change to the allowance for uncollectible amounts may be required if a future event or other change in circumstances results in a change in the estimate of the ultimate collectibility of a specific account 
reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
the company records a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories in order to ensure inventories are carried at the lower of cost or fair market value 
fair market value can be affected by assumptions about market demand  market conditions  historical usage rates  model changes and new product introductions 
if model changes or new product introductions create less than favorable market conditions  the reserve for excess and obsolete inventories may need to increase 
refer to note  significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the basis of accounting for inventories 
litigation 
the company accrues for litigation exposure based upon its assessment  made in consultation with counsel  of the likely range of exposure stemming from the claim 
in light of existing reserves  the company s litigation claims  when finally resolved  will not  in the opinion of management  have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position 
if current estimates for the cost of resolving any claims are later determined to be inadequate  results of operations could be adversely affected in the period in which additional provisions are required 
the company estimates a range of losses when the amount and range of loss can be estimated 
in the event that no amount within the range is a better estimate  the company records at least the minimum amount in the range 
the company records a loss when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
warranty reserves 
the company records a liability for standard product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
the liability is estimated using historical warranty experience  projected claim rates and expected costs per claim 
if necessary  the company adjusts its liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and are reasonably estimable 
the company s warranty reserves are affected by product failure rates and material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if these estimated costs differ from actual product failure rates  and actual material usage and labor costs  a revision to the warranty reserve would be required 
refer to note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
self insurance reserves 
the company records a liability for self insurance obligations  which include employee related health care benefits and claims for workers compensation  product liability  general liability and auto liability 
the liability is estimated based on claims incurred as of the date of the financial statements 
in estimating the obligations associated with self insurance reserves  the company primarily uses loss development factors based on historical claim experience 
these loss development factors are used to estimate ultimate losses on incurred claims 
actual costs associated with a specific claim can vary from an earlier estimate 
if the facts were to change  the liability recorded for expected costs associated with a specific claim may need to be revised 
pension and postretirement benefit reserves 
pension  postretirement and postemployment costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by assumptions including the discount rate  the estimated future return on plan assets  the annual rate of increase in compensation for plan employees  the increase in costs of health care benefits and other factors 
the company evaluates assumptions used on a periodic basis and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 
the company utilizes the moody s aa long term corporate bond yield as a basis for determining the discount rate with a yield adjustment made for the longer duration of the company s obligations 
as a result of the decline in moody s aa long term corporate bond yield and the overall declining interest rate environment  the company lowered its discount rate assumption used to determine pension obligations from percent to percent at december  and  respectively 
the company evaluates its assumption regarding the estimated long term rate of return on plan assets based on the historical experience and future expectations on investment returns 
the company chooses a rate of return on plan assets that it believes is an appropriate long term average return 
the expected return on plan assets takes into account estimated future investment returns for various asset classes held in the plans portfolio 
the company lowered its investment return assumptions in determining pension cost to percent in compared with percent in and as a result of the lower discount rate  the reduced return on plan assets and the increased unrecognized actuarial losses in  pension expense is expected to increase to approximately million in  from million in and million in under current accounting guidelines  if individual pension plans are underfunded on an accumulated benefit obligation basis  the shortfall in assets is required to be recorded as an additional minimum liability 
in recognizing an additional minimum liability  an intangible asset equal to the unrecognized prior service cost is recorded with the excess reported in common shareholders equity  net of tax 
in  the company recorded a non cash reduction in equity of million  net of tax 
if equity market returns do not improve in and if interest rates remain at current levels  the company could be required to record an additional non cash reduction in equity 
pension  postretirement and postemployment benefit reserves are determined in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits  respectively 
refer to note  pension and other postretirement benefits  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the assumptions used and for changes in the accrued benefit 
recent accounting pronouncements effective january   the company adopted sfas no

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the company believes the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on the financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation clarifies the requirements for a guarantor s accounting for and disclosures of certain guarantees issued and outstanding 
fin also clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of a guarantee 
fin is effective for guarantees entered into or modified after december  the company has not determined the impact fin will have on the financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
this interpretation clarifies how to identify variable interest entities and how the company should assess its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate the entity 
fin applies to variable interest entities created after january   in which the company obtains an interest after that date 
also  fin applies in the first fiscal quarter or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which the company holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  the company has not determined the impact fin will have on the financial statements 
subsequent events in january  the company purchased a percent equity interest in bella veneet oy bella  a boat manufacturer located in finland 
the company will account for this investment using the equity method and will have the option to acquire the remaining equity interest of bella in forward looking statements certain statements in this annual report are forward looking as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements in this annual report may include words such as expect  anticipate  believe  may  should  could  or estimate 
these statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations as of the date of this filing 
these risks include  but are not limited to general economic conditions  a weakened stock market and consumer confidence  and resultant demand for the company s products  particularly in the united states and europe like many companies  the company s revenues have been  and continue to be  affected by weak domestic and international market conditions and the fluctuating stock market 
the threat of war in the middle east and other global political events may adversely affect consumer confidence during and beyond 
the company s future results may continue to suffer if general economic conditions do not improve 
the effect of interest rates and fuel prices on demand for marine products the company s marine products  particularly boats  are often financed  and higher interest rates can retard demand for these products 
the company s marine businesses are somewhat fuel cost sensitive  and higher fuel costs can also hurt demand 
adverse weather conditions retarding sales of marine products sales of the company s marine products are generally more robust just before and during spring and summer  and favorable weather during these months tends to have a positive effect on consumer demand 
conversely  poor weather conditions during these periods can retard demand 
shifts in currency exchange rates the company manufactures its products predominately in the united states  though international manufacturing and sourcing are increasing 
a strong us dollar can make the company s products less price competitive relative to locally produced products in international markets 
the company is focusing on international manufacturing and global sourcing in part to offset this risk 
competitive pricing pressures across all of the company s product lines  introduction of lower cost alternatives by other companies can hurt the company s competitive position 
the company s efforts toward cost containment  commitment to quality products  and excellence in operational effectiveness and customer service are designed in part to offset this risk 
inventory adjustments by the company  its major dealers  retailers and independent boatbuilders the company s inventory reduction efforts have focused on reducing production  which results in lower rates of absorption of fixed costs and thus lower margins 
in addition  as the company s dealers and retailers  as well as independent boatbuilders who purchase the company s marine engine products  adjust their inventories downward  wholesale demand for the company s products diminishes 
inventory reduction can hurt the company s short term results of operations and limit the company s ability to meet increased demand when the us economy recovers 
financial difficulties experienced by dealers and independent boatbuilders the us economic downturn has adversely affected some of the company s dealers 
as the main distribution channel for the company s products  dealer health is critical to the company s continued success 
in addition  a substantial portion of the company s engine sales are made to independent boatbuilders 
as a result  the company s financial results can be influenced by the availability of capital and the financial health of these independent boatbuilders 
the ability to maintain effective distribution the company sells the majority of its products through third parties such as dealers  retailers and distributors 
maintaining good relationships with superior distribution partners  and establishing new distribution channels where appropriate  is critical to the company s continued success 
the company s ability to complete environmental remediation efforts and resolve claims and litigation at the cost estimated as discussed in part i  item above  the company is subject to claims and litigation in the ordinary course of operations 
these claims include several environmental proceedings  some of which involve costly remediation efforts over extended periods of time  as well as certain litigation matters which if not resolved in the company s favor  could require significant expenditures by the company 
the company believes that it is adequately reserved for these obligations  but significant increases in the anticipated costs associated with these matters could hurt the company s results of operations in the period or periods in which additional reserves or outlays are deemed necessary 
the company s ability to develop product technologies which comply with regulatory requirements as discussed in part i  item above  the company s marine engine segment is subject to emissions standards that require ongoing efforts to bring the company s engine products in line with regulatory requirements 
the company believes that these efforts are on track and will be successful  but unforeseen delays in these efforts could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the success of marketing and cost management programs and the company s ability to develop and produce competitive new products and technologies the company is constantly subject to competitive pressures 
the company s continuing ability to respond to these pressures  particularly through cost containment initiatives  marketing strategies  and the introduction of new products and technologies  is critical to the company s continued success 
the ability to maintain product quality and service standards expected by the company s customers the company s consumers demand high quality products and excellent customer service 
the company s ability to meet these demands through continuous quality improvement across all of its businesses will significantly impact the company s future results 
the company s ability to maintain market share and volume in key high margin product lines  particularly in its marine engine segment the company derives a significant portion of its earnings from sales of higher margin products  especially in its marine engine business 
changes in sales mix to lower margin products  including low emission engines  as well as increased competition in these product lines  could adversely impact the company s future operating results 
the company is focusing on cost containment efforts  new product development and global sourcing initiatives  as well as operational improvements  to offset this risk 
the ability to successfully integrate acquisitions the company has acquired several new businesses since and intends to continue to acquire additional businesses to complement its existing portfolio 
the company s success in effectively integrating these operations  including their financial  operational and distribution practices and systems  will affect the contribution of these businesses to the company s consolidated results 
adverse foreign economic conditions as the company continues to focus on international growth  it will become increasingly vulnerable to the effects of political instability  economic conditions and war in key world regions 
the effect of weak financial markets on pension expense and funding levels the company has made  and will continue to make as necessary  contributions to meet its pension funding obligations 
the company s pension expense is affected by the performance of financial markets where pension assets are invested 
these costs will continue to increase if the performance of financial markets weaken further 
the success of global sourcing and supply chain management initiatives the company has launched a number of initiatives to strengthen its sourcing and supply chain management activities 
the success of these initiatives will play a critical role in the company s continuing ability to reduce costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
the company enters into various hedging transactions to mitigate these risks in accordance with guidelines established by the company s management 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage foreign exchange exposure related to transactions  assets and liabilities that are subject to risk from foreign currency rate changes 
the company s principal currency exposures relate to the euro  canadian dollar  japanese yen  british pound and australian dollar 
hedging of anticipated transactions is accomplished with financial instruments as the maturity date of the instrument  along with the realized gain or loss  occurs on or near the execution of the anticipated transaction 
hedging of an asset or liability is accomplished through the use of financial instruments as the gain or loss on the hedging instrument offsets the gain or loss on the asset or liability 
the company uses interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the effect that changes in interest rates have on the fair market value of the company s debt and to lower the company s borrowing costs 
the company s net exposure to interest rate risk is primarily attributable to fixed rate debt instruments 
interest rate risk management is accomplished through the use of interest rate swaps and floating rate instruments that are benchmarked to us and european short term money market interest rates 
in the fourth quarter of  the company deferred a realized gain of million on the termination of interest rate swaps in advance of their scheduled termination date 
the deferred gain will be amortized through based upon the underlying debt  in effect decreasing interest expense associated with the company s borrowings 
raw materials used by the company are exposed to the effect of changing commodity prices 
accordingly  the company uses commodity swap agreements to manage fluctuations in prices of anticipated purchases of certain raw materials 
the company uses a value at risk var computation to estimate the maximum one day reduction in pre tax earnings related to its foreign currency  interest rate and commodity price sensitive derivative financial instruments 
the var computation includes the company s debt  foreign currency forwards  interest rate swap agreements and commodity swap agreements 
the amounts shown below represent the estimated reduction in fair market value that the company could incur on its derivative financial instruments from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates or commodity prices using the var estimation model 
the var model uses the monte carlo simulation statistical modeling technique and uses historical foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates and prices in future periods 
it estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques and includes substantially all market risk exposures 
the estimated potential losses shown in the table below have no effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
amount in time confidence risk category millions period level foreign exchange day interest rates day commodity prices day the percent confidence level signifies the company s degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above 
the amounts shown disregard the possibility that foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices could move in the company s favor 
the var model assumes that all movements in rates and commodity prices will be adverse 
actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time  and it is highly unlikely that the company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time 
these amounts should not be considered projections of future losses  as actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in global financial markets
