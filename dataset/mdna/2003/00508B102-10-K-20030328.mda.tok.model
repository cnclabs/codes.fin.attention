overview we are a provider of a leading information application platform 
we began shipping our first product in january we sell software products through two primary means i directly to end user customers through our direct sales force and ii through indirect channel partners such as oems  distributors and system integrators 
oems generally integrate our products with their applications and either provide hosting services or resell them with their products 
our other indirect channel partners resell our software products to end user customers 
our revenues are derived from license fees for software products and fees for services relating to such products  including software maintenance and support  consulting and training 
license fees from sales of software products directly to end user customers or indirect channel partners are recognized as revenues after execution of a non cancelable signed license agreement or receipt of a definitive purchase order  and shipment of the product  if no vendor obligations remain  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the license fees are fixed or determinable  and collection of the license fee is considered probable 
probability of collection is based upon the assessment of the customer s financial condition through the review of their current financial statements or credit reports 
for follow on sales to existing customers  prior payment history is also considered to evaluate probability of collection 
our products do not require significant customization 
the majority of end user license revenues are derived from end user customer orders for specific individual products 
these types of transactions are recognized as revenues upon shipment of product  assuming that all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if the license agreement contains extended payment terms which would indicate that the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenues are recognized as the payments become due  assuming that all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
license arrangements with oems are for specified duration and require that such vendors only license our products to their customers for use with such oem s application 
furthermore  license arrangements with distributors give such distributors the right to distribute our products to customers headquartered in specified territories 
license arrangements with indirect channel partners such as oems  system integrators and distributors generally take the form of arrangements pursuant to which a license fee is paid to us  which we recognize as revenues when no further obligations remain  provided that the fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivables is deemed probable 
for arrangements in which the contracting entity has the right to the unlimited usage  unspecified future products  and resale of the licensed software for a specified term and pursuant to which license fee revenues are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the license agreement 
in certain situations where customers have received payment terms outside of our customary standard terms but within one year  we have recognized revenues upon delivery  provided that we have  in the past  collected all payments as due under comparable arrangements  without providing concessions 
we have not established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe for license fees and therefore we recognize revenues from arrangements with multiple elements involving software licenses under the residual method as outlined in statement of position no 
software revenue recognition 
to the extent that a discount exists on any of the elements  we follow the residual method and attribute that discount entirely to the delivered elements 

table of contents service revenues consist of maintenance  consulting  training  and related services that we provide to our customers 
revenues from such services are generally recognized when performed 
if services are included with a license agreement  amounts related to services are unbundled from the license fee based on vsoe as established by transactions where such services have been sold separately 
when we provide a software license and the related maintenance for one bundled price  the vsoe of the maintenance  based on the price charged for that element separately  is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the respective agreement 
to date  we have sold our products internationally primarily through our subsidiaries in europe and asia pacific 
during fiscal years and  we derived of our total revenues from sales outside of north america while of our total revenues was derived from sales outside north america in fiscal year our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on our success in increasing revenues from international sales 
although we intend to continue to invest significant resources to expand our sales and support operations outside north america and to enter additional international markets  we cannot assure you that such efforts will be successful 
in order to successfully expand international sales  we must establish additional foreign operations  expand our international channel management and support organizations  hire additional personnel  recruit additional international distributors and increase the productivity of existing international distributors 
if we are not successful in expanding international operations in a timely and cost effective manner  our business  operating results and financial condition could be harmed 
we have a limited ability to forecast future revenues and expenses  thus the prediction of future operating results is difficult and unreliable 
in addition  historical growth rates in our revenues and earnings should not be considered indicative of future revenue or earnings growth rates or operating results 
there can be no assurance that any of our business strategies will be successful or that we will be able to achieve and maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  and in such event the price of our common stock could decline 
acquisitions in february  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of open software technology llc ost for cash and shares of actuate stock 
the acquisition was accounted under the purchase method of accounting 
in connection with this acquisition  we recorded million in goodwill and identified intangible assets 
the results of operations of ost and the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
in march  we purchased all the assets and business of enterprisesoft 
in connection with this purchase  we recorded million in goodwill and identified intangible assets 
the results of operations of enterprisesoft and the estimated fair value of assets acquired are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of purchase 
in april  we purchased additional shares of our distributor in japan actuate japan from existing shareholders and became the majority shareholder 
we currently own of actuate japan 
in connection with this purchase  we recorded million in goodwill 
the results of operations of actuate japan and the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date we became the majority shareholder 
the excess loss applicable to the minority shareholders has been charged to us  as the minority shareholders are not obligated to contribute their share of losses exceeding their equity capital 
in may  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of tidestone technologies  inc tidestone  a software technology company 
in connection with this purchase  we recorded million in goodwill and identified intangible assets 
the results of operations of tidestone and the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates general 
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on a regular basis  we evaluate estimates  including those related to bad debts  income taxes  restructuring  and litigation 
estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenues are a key component of our results of operations 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines  discussed above  in measuring revenues  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue recognition policy 
for example  we are required to exercise judgment in evaluating risk of concession when payments terms are beyond the normal credit period of net days 
further  assessment of collectibility is particularly critical in determining whether or not revenues should be recognized in the current market environment 
we also record a small provision for estimated sales returns on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  revenues could be overstated 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is established primarily through a charge to general and administrative expenses 
this allowance is for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
it is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer  age of the receivable balance  individually and in the aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different allowance balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
allowance for deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income or reduce loss and increase shareholder s equity in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
contingencies 
we are engaged in extraordinary legal actions and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual matter 
the required reserves  if any  may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy for a particular matter 
accrual for restructuring charges 
during the fiscal year ended december   we implemented certain restructuring plans that were a combination of a reduction in workforce  exit of idle facilities and the write off of fixed assets 
the restructuring charges were based on actual and estimated costs incurred in 
table of contents connection with these restructuring plans 
these estimates have been impacted by the rules governing the termination of employees  especially those in foreign countries 
we have not recorded payments related to potential settlements with separated employees  as these amounts are not reasonably estimable and probable 
if  in the future  we were to agree upon additional severance payments  we would have to record additional restructuring charges in the period in which the settlement was determined to be reasonably estimable and probable 
we recorded a facility restructuring charge  which consisted of estimated future obligations for the non cancelable lease payments and estimated costs associated with subleasing the property 
we have reduced the amount of the facility restructuring charge by the estimated amount of sublease income 
the assumptions we have made are based on such factors as future vacancy rates  the time required to sublease the property and sublease rates 
these market conditions can fluctuate greatly due to such factors as changes in property occupancy rates and the rental prices charged for comparable properties 
these changes could materially affect our accrual 
if  in future periods  it is determined that we have over accrued for restructuring charges for exiting the idle facilities  the reversal of such over accrual would have a favorable impact on our financial statements in the period this was determined and would be recorded as a credit to restructuring charges 
conversely  if it is determined that our accrual is insufficient  an additional charge would be recorded and would have an unfavorable impact on our financial statements in the period this was determined 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  revenues license fees services total revenues costs and expenses cost of license fees cost of services sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of goodwill in and other intangibles restructuring charges total costs and expenses loss income from operations interest and other income  net loss income before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss income pursuant to the emerging issues task force no 
eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  services revenues and cost of services revenues have been reclassified for years prior to december  to reflect out of pocket expenses billed to customers as revenue rather than a reduction of the related expense 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenues our revenues are derived from license fees and services  which include software maintenance and support  consulting and training 
total revenues decreased by from million in fiscal year to 
table of contents million in fiscal year and increased by from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year we believe that continuing weak global economic conditions have caused our customers and prospective customers to significantly decrease spending on information technology 
we currently expect weak economic conditions and reduced information technology spending to continue at least through the first half of fiscal year we believe war time conditions would further limit spending on information technology and would negatively impact our revenues 
no single customer accounted for more than of our revenues for any of the periods presented 
license fees 
revenues from license fees decreased by from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year and increased by from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the decrease in license fee revenues in fiscal year was primarily due to continuing weak global economic conditions and a corresponding decrease in the demand for our products 
the increase in license fee revenues in fiscal year was primarily due to increased sales to new customers and increased follow on sales to existing customers 
revenues from license fees from our indirect channel partners  including oems  system integrators and distributors  accounted for  and of total revenues from license fees for fiscal years  and  respectively 
services 
revenues from services increased by from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year and increased by from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the increases in both fiscal years and were primarily due to an increase in the installed base of customers receiving ongoing maintenance and support 
costs and expenses cost of license fees 
cost of license fees consists primarily of product packaging  documentation and production costs 
cost of license fees decreased by from million  or of revenues from license fees  in fiscal year to million  or of revenues from license fees  in fiscal year cost of license fees increased by from million  or of revenues from license fees  in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year was primarily due to the corresponding decrease in license fee revenues 
the increase in fiscal year was primarily due to increased packaging and production costs to support increased sales 
we expect our cost of license fees as a percentage of revenues from license fees to be between and of revenues from license fees in future periods 
cost of services 
cost of services consists primarily of personnel and related costs  facilities costs incurred in providing software maintenance and support  training and consulting services  as well as third party costs incurred in providing training and consulting services 
cost of services decreased by from million or of service revenues  in fiscal year to million  or of services revenues  in fiscal year cost of services increased by from million  or of services revenues  in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the decreases in cost of services in absolute dollars and as a percentage of services revenues during fiscal year were primarily due to an increase in on going maintenance and support revenues and decreased contracting with third party consultants to support our customers professional service needs 
the increase in cost of services in absolute dollars in fiscal year was primarily due to the expansion of our customer service organization to support our increasing installed customer base 
we expect our cost of services  as a percentage of services revenues  to decrease in future periods as we intend to continue to utilize our own personnel  rather than third party consultants which has a higher cost and lower margin  to perform a significant portion of the consulting and training services 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  promotional expenses  travel  entertainment and facility costs 
sales and marketing expenses decreased by from million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year sales and marketing expenses increased by from million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the decreases in sales and marketing expenses in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal 
table of contents year were primarily due to reduction of sales and marketing personnel  lower sales commissions associated with decreased revenues and reduced marketing program activities 
the increases in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal year were primarily due to the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel  higher sales commissions associated with increased revenues and increased marketing program activities 
we currently expect our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues to be in about the range in future periods 
research and development 
research and development expenses are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of personnel and related costs associated with the development of new products  the enhancement of existing products  quality assurance and testing 
research and development expenses decreased by from million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year research and development expenses increased by from million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the decrease in research and development expenses in absolute dollars in fiscal year was primarily due to reduced headcount in connection with restructuring plans 
the increase in absolute dollars in fiscal year was primarily due to increased personnel and related costs associated with the development of new products  the enhancement of existing products  quality assurance and testing  depreciation of capital expenditures and facilities costs 
the increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues for fiscal year was due to the decline in our total revenues in fiscal year  as compared to total revenues for the same period in fiscal year we believe that continued investments in technology and product development are essential for us to remain competitive in the markets we serve  and we expect research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues to be in about the same range in future periods 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for finance  human resources  information systems and general management  as well as legal  bad debts and accounting expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by from million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year general and administrative expenses increased by from million  or of total revenues  in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the increases in general and administrative expenses in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal year were primarily due to increase in legal fees associated with the microstrategy litigation and the sec inquiry  totaling million  as well as a large increase in premiums for our directors and officers insurance policy 
the increases in general and administrative expenses in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal year were primarily due to the idle facility expenses and increased personnel and related costs 
we expect our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods due primarily to projected increases in legal fees expense associated with the microstrategy litigation and increases in premiums for our directors and officers insurance policy 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
on january   we implemented statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  safs which addresses the financial accounting and reporting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
this accounting standard requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  and instead  be tested for impairment on a periodic basis 
accordingly  we discontinued the amortization of goodwill effective january  in addition  we reclassified million of acquired workforce  which is no longer defined as acquired intangible assets under sfas  as goodwill 
as a result  no acquired workforce amortization was recognized in fiscal year the provisions of sfas require the completion of a transitional impairment test within six months of adopting the accounting standard  any impairments identified must be treated as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
during the quarter ended june   we completed the transitional impairment test  which did not result in an impairment of recorded goodwill 
the provisions of sfas also require an annual impairment test  which we completed on october  the annual impairment test also did not result in an impairment of recorded goodwill 

table of contents amortization of goodwill was nil for fiscal year  as compared to million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in the amortization of goodwill in fiscal year was due to the adoption of sfas the increase in the amortization of goodwill in fiscal year was due primarily to the addition of goodwill resulting from the tidestone acquisition in may amortization of other intangible assets was million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the decrease in amortization of other intangible assets in fiscal year was a result of the adoption of sfas  which reclassified acquired workforce as goodwill and amortization was no longer required 
the increase in amortization of other intangible assets in fiscal year was due primarily to the amortization of intangible assets acquired from the purchase of tidestone in may restructuring charges 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with note to the consolidated financial statements  which is included in this form k 
during fiscal year  we recorded a restructuring charge of million 
this charge consisted of a million facility exit charge and million in costs related to the reduction of our worldwide workforce 
the facility exit charge was the result of a long term non cancelable lease agreement that we entered into during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  in anticipation of a projected business expansion 
due to the continuing global economic downturn  the expansion plan did not materialize and the facility had been idle since the commencement of the lease on may  during the third quarter of fiscal year  we decided to exit this facility and have since been attempting to sublease it 
the million facility exit charge consisted of million of estimated future obligations for the non cancelable lease payments net of million of estimated sublease income and estimated costs associated with subleasing the property eg  leasing commissions 
this facility exit charge also included a million write off of property and equipment primarily leasehold improvements as a result of the abandonment of leased facilities 
as stated above  our facility exit charge of million was net of million of estimated sublease income 
our ability to generate this amount of sublease income is highly dependent upon the economic conditions  particularly the commercial real estate market conditions and our subleasing negotiations with third parties 
while the amount we have recorded is our best estimate  estimates are subject to change and may require adjustments as conditions and facts change 
if macroeconomic conditions  particularly as they pertain to the commercial real estate market  continue to be negative  we may be required in the future to increase our estimated cost to exit the facility 
current economic conditions and the decline in our forecasted revenues also caused us to take actions to reduce our workforce 
accordingly  we recorded a workforce reduction charge of million related to severance and fringe benefit payments for terminated employees 
the restructuring will result in reduction of our worldwide headcount by approximately or employees across all employee levels  business functions  operating units and geographic regions 
as of december   approximately employees had been terminated as a result of the restructuring 
the remaining employee terminations will be completed during the first quarter of fiscal year during fiscal year  we paid approximately million in cash related to workforce reduction and we expect that our remaining accrual of  will be paid during the first quarter of fiscal year if the current business conditions do not improve  we may take actions to further reduce our workforce  which will result in additional restructuring charges 
during the second and third quarter of fiscal year  we implemented restructuring actions that resulted in aggregate charges of  the restructuring costs consisted entirely of severance payments  payroll taxes and extended medical benefits 
the restructuring plan resulted in the elimination of approximately of our worldwide workforce or positions across all levels and functions 
during fiscal year  we paid  in cash related to this restructuring plan and the remaining amount of  was paid in the first quarter of fiscal year deferred compensation 
deferred compensation represents the difference between the exercise price of certain stock option grants and the fair value of our common stock at the time of such grants and also includes 
table of contents the intrinsic value of the unvested options assumed in business combinations 
in fiscal years  and  we recorded amortization expense of approximately   and  respectively 
all deferred compensation expense has been included in general and administrative expenses 
at december   we had approximately  in deferred compensation remaining to be amortized 
upon cancellation of the underlying stock options  the unamortized portion has been offset against additional paid in capital 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  are comprised primarily of interest income earned by us on our cash and short term investments 
interest and other income  net  decreased by from million in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  and increased by from  in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the decrease in interest and other income  net  in fiscal year was due to lower interest rates received on our investments 
the increase in interest and other income  net  in fiscal year was due primarily to higher cash and investment balances from which interest was earned 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes of  and million is based on pretax losses of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
in fiscal year  the provision for income taxes of million was based on the pretax income of million 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal year represents primarily federal  state and foreign taxes as adjusted for the impact of operating losses not currently utilized  income tax credits  and the recognition of additional deferred tax assets 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal year represented primarily federal and state alternative minimum taxes on pretax loss as adjusted for the impact of non deductible goodwill amortization and temporary differences for which deferred tax assets could not be recognized 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal year represented primarily federal and state alternative minimum taxes on pretax income before non deductible goodwill amortization  offset by the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits 
the decrease in the provision for income taxes in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to the recognition of additional deferred tax assets 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal year decreased only slightly as compared to that in fiscal year even though we incurred a pretax loss in fiscal year as compared to pretax income in fiscal year this was primarily due to the impact of higher non deductible goodwill amortization expenses related to the acquisition of tidestone  which occurred in fiscal year  and our inability to recognize deferred tax assets for the temporary differences 
we have determined that  based on a number of factors  only a portion of our total deferred tax assets should be recognized 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be ultimately realized 
these factors include consideration of past operating results as well as the predictability of future operating results 
we will continue to assess our ability to realize the tax benefits available to us based on actual and forecasted results 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have funded our operations primarily through approximately million in net proceeds from the private sales of preferred stock  million in net proceeds from our initial public offering in july  and cash from operations 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  an increase of million from million at december   and million in net working capital  an increase of million from million at december  in fiscal year  we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and million in net working capital 
cash from operating activities 
net cash provided from operations was million during fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  a decrease of million 
for fiscal year  cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net loss as adjusted by non cash items of depreciation  
table of contents amortization  restructuring charges and tax benefits from exercise of stock options  increased collections of accounts receivable and increase in income taxes payable  that were offset by decreases in accrued compensation  other accrued liabilities  deferred tax liabilities and increase in deferred tax assets 
during fiscal year  our operations provided net cash of million 
for fiscal year  cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net loss adjusted by non cash items of depreciation  amortization  tax benefits from exercise of stock options  increased collection on accounts receivable and increase in deferred revenues  which were offset by decreases in other current assets and accounts payable 
during fiscal year  net cash provided by operating activities was million  which was primarily due to net income as adjusted for depreciation  amortization and tax benefits from exercise of stock options  increases in accrued compensation  other accrued liabilities and deferred revenue  that were offset by increases in accounts receivable and other current assets 
cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  an increase of million 
for fiscal year  cash used in investing activities was primarily due to purchases of short term investments  the final purchase price payment related to the acquisition of ost and purchases of property and equipment  that were offset by the proceeds received from the maturity of short term investments 
actuate s investing activities used net cash of million dollars in fiscal year approximately half of the cash used in investing activities during fiscal year was for the purchase of property and equipment  including the furnishing of the additional office facility located adjacent to our south san francisco headquarters 
the remainder of the cash used in investing activities  net of proceeds from maturity of short term investments  was primarily for the purchases of short term investments 
total net cash used in investing activities in fiscal year was million 
during fiscal year  cash was used primarily to purchase property and equipment for our newly relocated and expanded facilities in south san francisco  and for our acquisition of ost and enterprisesoft  which were offset by proceeds received from the maturity of short term investments 
cash from financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activity was  in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  a decrease of million 
for fiscal year  cash provided from financing activities was primarily from the proceeds derived from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase and stock option plans  that was offset by the open market repurchases of our common stock 
the stock was repurchased in accordance with the stock repurchase program the program that was authorized by our board of directors on september  the program allowed us to repurchase up to million of our common stock on the open market 
during fiscal year  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for approximately million under the program 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we repurchased an additional  shares of our common stock for million 
on october   our board of directors extended the program by authorizing our management to repurchase up to an additional million worth of our common stock 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we did not make any repurchases under the program 
net cash provided from financing activities was million in fiscal year for fiscal year  cash provided from financing activities was primarily attributable to the net proceeds from exercise of options under our stock option plan and from employee purchases of common stock under our stock purchase plan  offset by the open market repurchases of our stock and by the repayment of a bank loan assumed in connection with the tidestone acquisition 
in fiscal year  net cash provided from financing activities was million 
during fiscal year  cash from financing activities primarily reflected the net proceeds from exercise of options under our stock option plan and from employee purchases of common stock under our stock purchase plan 
we believe that our current cash balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures requirements for at least the next twelve months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may find it necessary to sell additional equity or obtain credit facilities 
the sale of additional equity could result in additional dilution to our current stockholders 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses  including the acquisition of the minority interest in our japanese distributor  or complementary products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
our future contractual obligations include minimum lease payments under operating leases at december   and are as follows in thousands fiscal year payments due by period thereafter in connection with the office building leases in south san francisco  california  we have provided the landlord with a letter of credit in the amount of million as a security deposit 
we have provided security interest in all of our assets as a security for the letter of credit 
recently issued accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas which supersedes eitf issue sfas requires companies to record liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities to be recognized only when the liability is incurred instead of at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal activity 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of sfas may affect the timing of recognition of future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized under such costs 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb released fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin establishes new disclosure and liability recognition requirements for direct and indirect debt guarantees with specified characteristics 
the initial measurement and recognition requirements of fin are effective prospectively for guarantees issued or modified after december  however  the disclosure requirements are effective for interim and annual financial statement periods ending after december  our license agreements include indemnification for infringements of third party intellectual property rights and also include certain warranties 
no amounts have been accrued relating to those indemnities and warranties 
we have also issued letters of credit totaling million related to our leased facilities 
we do not have any other guarantees 
we do not expect the full adoption of fin to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 
sfas this statement amends sfas to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition and annual disclosure requirements are effective for the company s fiscal year the interim disclosure requirements are effective for the first quarter of fiscal year we continue to account for stock based compensation using apb and have not adopted the recognition provisions of sfas  as amended by sfas we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents risk factors that may affect future results investors should carefully consider the following risk factors and warnings before making an investment decision 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing actuate 
additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  operating results or financial condition could be materially harmed 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
investors should also refer to the other information set forth in this report on form k  including the financial statements and the notes thereto 
our operating results may be volatile and difficult to predict 
if we fail to meet our estimates of quarterly and annual operating results or we fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the market price of our stock may decrease significantly 
the susceptibility of our operating results to significant fluctuations makes any prediction  including our estimates  of future operating results unreliable 
in addition  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely on them as indications of our future performance 
our operating results have in the past  and may in the future  vary significantly due to factors such as the following demand for our products  the size and timing of significant orders for our products  a slow down or a decrease in spending on information technology by our current and or prospective customers  general domestic and international economic and political conditions  including war or the threat of war  sales cycles and sales performance of our indirect channel partners  the existence and the outcome of the microstrategy lawsuit  continued successful relationships and the establishment of new relationships with oems  the management and expansion of our international operations  changes in our level of operating expenses and our ability to control costs  the outcome or publicity surrounding any pending or threatened lawsuits  ability to make new products commercially available in a timely manner  budgeting cycles of our customers  changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors  failure to successfully manage acquisitions made by us  defects in our products and other product quality problems  and failure to meet hiring needs and unexpected personnel changes 
because our software products are typically shipped shortly after orders are received  total revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped throughout that quarter 
booking of orders in the third quarter of was negatively impacted by the september th terrorist attacks and future terrorists acts or war time conditions are likely to impact the booking of orders in future periods 
in addition  our current and prospective customers have concerns about the microstrategy lawsuit 
the existence of the lawsuit is negatively impacting our customer s decision to purchase our products 
if we were to lose the microstrategy lawsuit  
table of contents bookings of future orders would likely be significantly affected 
furthermore  several factors may require us  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  to defer recognition of license fee revenue for a significant period of time after entering into a license agreement  including whether the license agreement includes both software products that are then currently available and software products or other enhancements that are still under development  whether the license agreement relates entirely or partly to then currently undeliverable software products  whether the license agreement requires the performance of services that may preclude revenue recognition until successful completion of such services  and whether the license agreement includes acceptance criteria that may preclude revenue recognition prior to customer acceptance 
in addition  we may in the future experience fluctuations in our gross and operating margins due to changes in the mix of our domestic and international revenues  changes in the mix of our direct sales and indirect sales and changes in the mix of license revenues and service revenues  as well as changes in the mix among the indirect channels through which our products are offered 
a significant portion of our total revenues in any given quarter is derived from existing customers 
our ability to achieve future revenue growth  if any  will be substantially dependent upon our ability to increase revenues from license fees and services from existing customers  to expand our sales force and to increase the average size of our orders 
to the extent that such increases do not occur in a timely manner  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
our expense levels and any plans for expansion  including plans to increase our sales and marketing and research and development efforts  are based in significant part on our expectations of future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
if revenues fall below our expectations and we are unable to quickly reduce our spending in response  our business  operating results and financial condition are likely to be harmed 
based upon all of the factors described above  we have a limited ability to forecast future revenues and expenses and it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results will be below our estimates or the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in the event that operating results are below our estimates or other expectations  the price of our common stock could decline 
if we do not successfully expand our distribution channels and develop and maintain relationships with oems  our business would be seriously harmed 
to date  we have sold our products principally through our direct sales force  as well as through indirect sales channels  such as our oems  distributors and systems integrators 
our revenues from license fees resulting from sales through indirect channel partners were approximately  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on the success of our sales force in further establishing and maintaining relationships with indirect channel partners 
in particular  a significant element of our strategy is to embed our technology in products offered by oems for resale or as a hosted application to such oem s customers and end users 
we also intend to establish and expand our relationships with systems integrators so that such systems integrators will increasingly recommend our products to their clients 
our future success will depend on the ability of our indirect channel partners to sell and support our products 
if the sales and implementation cycles of our indirect channel partners are lengthy or variable or our oems experience difficulties embedding our technology into their products or we fail to train the sales and customer support personnel of such indirect channel partners in a timely fashion  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 

table of contents although we are currently investing  and plan to continue to invest  significant resources to expand and develop relationships with oems  we have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in establishing and maintaining these relationships 
if we are unable to successfully expand these distribution channels and secure license agreements with additional oems on commercially reasonable terms  including significant up front payments of minimum license fees  and extend existing license agreements with existing oems on commercially reasonable terms  our operating results would be harmed 
any inability by us to maintain existing or establish new relationships with indirect channel partners  including systems integrators  or  if such efforts are successful  a failure of our revenues to increase correspondingly with expenses incurred in pursuing such relationships  would harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we fail to grow revenue from international operations and expand our international operations our business would be seriously harmed 
during fiscal years and  we derived of our total revenues from sales outside of north america while of our total revenues was derived from sales outside north america in fiscal year our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on our success in increasing revenues from international sales 
we intend to continue to invest significant resources to expand our sales and support operations outside north america and to enter additional international markets 
in order to expand international sales  we must establish additional foreign operations  expand our international channel management and support organizations  hire additional personnel  recruit additional international distributors and increase the productivity of existing international distributors 
if we are not successful in expanding international operations in a timely and cost effective manner  our business  operating results and financial condition could be harmed 
our litigation with microstrategy could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition in august   a lawsuit was filed in the virginia circuit court for fairfax county against us and two of our employees by microstrategy  incorporated microstrategy 
the lawsuit alleges that these employees  who previously worked for microstrategy  breached their fiduciary and contractual obligations to microstrategy by  among other things  misappropriating trade secrets and confidential information 
the complaint seeks injunctive relief and damages 
the trial for this case was completed on march  we expect the court to issue a decision on the case sometime between may and june of an adverse decision by the court in this case could have an adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition and result in the following we could be forced to stop selling our products  we will continue to incur substantial litigation costs in defense of this lawsuit  we may be required to indemnify our customers  we may have to use significant engineering resources to redesign our products as a result of this lawsuit  we may be required to enter into a licensing agreement with microstrategy containing terms that are unfavorable to us  we will be forced to commit significant engineering and management resources to resolve this lawsuit  and our customer s decision to purchase our products and services has and will be negatively impacted by the lawsuit 

table of contents we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
our market is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving standards 
our competition comes in four principal forms competition from current or future business intelligence software vendors such as brio technology  inc  business objects sa  cognos  inc  crystal decisions  inc  microsoft and microstrategy incorporated that offer reporting functionality as part of their suite of products  competition from e 
business software vendors such as sap and oracle  to the extent they include reporting functionality in their applications  competition from other e 
business software vendors and software development tool vendors  and competition from the it departments of current or potential customers that may develop information applications internally which may be cheaper and more customized than our products 
many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than us 
these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sales of their products than we may 
also  most current and potential competitors  including companies such as oracle and microsoft  have greater name recognition and the ability to leverage a significant installed customer base 
these companies could integrate competing reporting software development tools with their products or significantly increase the functionality of their existing reporting software development tools  either of which would result in a loss of market share for us 
we expect additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the information application software market and new products and technologies are introduced 
increased competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins  longer sales cycles and loss of market share  any of which would harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties  thereby increasing their ability to address the information application needs of our prospective customers 
also our current or future channel partners may have established in the past  or may in the future  establish cooperative relationships with our current or potential competitors  thereby limiting our ability to sell our products through particular distribution channels 
it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
such competition could harm our ability to obtain revenues from license fees from new or existing customers and service revenues from new or existing customers on terms favorable to us 
if we are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
intellectual property claims against us can be costly and could result in the loss of significant rights 
third parties may claim that our current or future products infringe such parties intellectual property rights 
we expect information application software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
a successful claim of product infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents if the market for information application software does not grow as we expect  our business would be seriously harmed 
the market for information application software products is still emerging and we cannot be certain that it will continue to grow or that  even if the market does grow  businesses will purchase our products 
if the market for information application software products fails to grow or grows more slowly than we expect  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
to date  all of our revenues have been derived from licenses for our e 
reporting software and related products and services  and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future 
we have spent  and intend to continue to spend  considerable resources educating potential customers and indirect channel partners about information applications and our products 
however  if such expenditures do not enable our products to achieve any significant degree of market acceptance  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
threatened litigation by the securities and exchange commission may have an adverse impact on our business and stock price 
in september  we were informed that the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec intends to recommend to the sec that it authorize the staff to bring a civil injunction action against actuate and nicolas nierenberg  our chairman and chief technology officer 
the potential action would allege that actuate and mr 
nierenberg violated  either directly or as an aider and abettor  certain provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with two software license transactions that actuate completed with unify corporation unify in early the staff of the sec invited us and mr 
nierenberg to provide submissions explaining why the contemplated action should not be brought 
actuate and mr 
nierenberg have provided the staff with those submissions 
we have cooperated fully with the staff s investigation and we will continue to work with the sec to resolve these matters as quickly as possible 
the staff s actions arise from the sec s investigation and subsequent lawsuit against unify and two of its officers 
the sec s complaint against unify alleges that in and unify and the two officers engaged in a fraudulent scheme to overstate unify s revenues and earnings by improperly recognizing revenues from a series of transactions completed with more than different companies 
the transaction with actuate is one of the transactions cited in the complaint against unify 
in early  we completed two separate license agreements with unify 
in one agreement  actuate acquired a license to distribute a unify software product and in the other agreement  unify acquired a license to distribute an actuate software product 
the sec s complaint against unify alleged that these transactions were reciprocal and unify violated the federal securities laws when it improperly recognized revenues from these transactions 
the staff of the sec is investigating whether i we knew that unify was violating the law by improperly recording these transactions as revenues and therefore we and mr 
nierenberg aided and abetted unify s violations  and ii we improperly accounted for unify s license of our product 
the staff s letter to us states that the staff intends to recommend that the sec seek the following remedies i a permanent injunction prohibiting future violations of the exchange act and rules thereunder  ii civil penalties pursuant to the securities enforcement remedies and penny stock reform act of  and iii an order preventing mr 
nierenberg from serving as an officer or director of any entity having a class of securities registered pursuant to section of the exchange act or that is required to file reports pursuant to section d of the exchange act 
we believe that the actuate unify transactions were entered into for valid business purposes 
when we entered into these transactions we believed they were advantageous to our business because they allowed us to acquire certain java technology we felt unify s products had a good technical reputation at that time and to have our software bundled with unify s application server 
we also believe that mr 
nierenberg and actuate did not know of unify s alleged fraud and in no way aided or abetted unify in its alleged scheme to overstate its revenues 

table of contents we further believe our accounting treatment of the license transactions had no material impact to our financial statements reported in fiscal we only recognized approximately  of amortized maintenance revenues related to the license of our product by unify in the second quarter of fiscal less than of total revenues for that quarter and we subsequently reversed this revenue in the third quarter of fiscal no other amounts were recorded as revenues in our income statements 
the negative publicity regarding this contemplated sec action may harm our reputation and adversely impact our business and the price of our common stock 
in addition  any subsequent recommendation that the staff of the sec commence litigation against us or mr 
nierenberg  may seriously harm our reputation and adversely impact our business and the price of our common stock 
although we believe any monetary penalties resulting from litigation or a settlement arising therefrom will not have a material financial impact on us  such litigation or settlement may absorb significant management time and harm our reputation and adversely impact our business and the price of our common stock 
because the sales cycles of our products are lengthy and variable  our quarterly results may fluctuate 
the purchase of our products by our end user customers for deployment within the customer s organization typically involves a significant commitment of capital and other resources  and is therefore subject to delays that are beyond our control 
these delays can arise from a customer s internal procedures to approve large capital expenditures  budgetary constraints and the testing and acceptance of new technologies that affect key operations as well as general economic and political events 
the sales cycle for an initial order of our products is typically to months and the sales cycle associated with a follow on large scale deployment of our products typically extends for another to months or longer 
we may experience longer sales cycles in the future 
additionally  sales cycles for sales of our products to oems tend to be longer  ranging from to months or more and may involve convincing the vendor s entire organization that our products are the appropriate information application software for the vendor s application 
this time period does not include the sales and implementation cycles of such vendor s own products  which are typically significantly longer than our sales and implementation cycles 
certain of our customers have in the past  or may in the future  experience difficulty completing the initial implementation of our products 
any difficulties or delays in the initial implementation by our end user customers or our indirect channel partners could cause such customers to reject our software or lead to the delay or non receipt of future orders for the large scale deployment of our products 
we may make future acquisitions and acquisitions involve numerous risks our business is highly competitive  and as such  our growth is dependent upon market growth and our ability to enhance our existing products  introduce new products on a timely basis and expand our distribution channels and professional services organization 
one of the ways we have addressed and will continue to address these issues is through acquisitions of other companies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following difficulties in integration of the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  the risk of diverting management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  negative impact to our financial condition and results of operations resulting from combining the acquired company s financial condition and results of operations with our financial statements  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
mergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  and we cannot assure you that any acquisition will be successful and will not materially harm our business  operating results or financial condition 

table of contents if we do not respond to rapid technological changes  our products could become obsolete and our business could be seriously harmed 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  changing customer demands and evolving industry standards 
any of these factors can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to support current and future releases of popular operating systems and computer programming languages  databases and e 
business software applications  to timely develop new products that achieve market acceptance and to meet an expanding range of customer requirements 
if the announcement or introduction of new products by us or our competitors or any change in industry standards causes customers to defer or cancel purchases of existing products  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
as a result of the complexities inherent in information applications  major new products and product enhancements can require long development and testing periods 
in addition  customers may delay their purchasing decisions in anticipation of the general availability of new or enhanced versions of our products 
as a result  significant delays in the general availability of such new releases or significant problems in the installation or implementation of such new releases could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we fail to successfully develop  on a timely and cost effective basis  product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change  evolving industry standards or customer requirements or such new products and product enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance  our business  operating results and financial condition may be harmed 
if we do not release new products and enhancements to existing products in a timely manner or if such new products and enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance  our business could be seriously harmed 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on the success of new products and enhancements to our products that we make generally available 
prior to the release of any new products or enhancements  the products must undergo a long development and testing period 
to date  the development and testing of new products and enhancements have taken longer than expected 
in the event the development and testing of new products and enhancements continue to take longer than expected  the release of new products and enhancements will be delayed 
if we fail to release new products and enhancements in a timely manner  our business  operating results and financial condition may be harmed 
in addition  if such new products and enhancements do not achieve market acceptance our business  operating results and financial condition may be harmed 
there are management and operational risks associated with our international operations that could seriously harm our business 
a substantial portion of actuate s revenues is derived from international sales 
during fiscal years and  we derived of our total revenues from sales outside of north america while of our total revenues was derived from sales outside north america in fiscal year international operations are subject to a number of risks  any of which could harm our business  operating results and financial conditions 
these risks include the following economic and political instability  including war or the threat of war  difficulty in managing an organization spread across many countries  multiple and conflicting tax laws and regulations  costs of localizing products for foreign countries  difficulty in hiring employees in foreign countries  trade laws and business practices favoring local competition  
table of contents dependence on local vendors  compliance with multiple  conflicting and changing government laws and regulations  longer sales and payment cycles  import and export restrictions and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty or delay in accounts receivable collection  and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we believe that an increasing portion of our revenues and costs will be denominated in foreign currencies 
to the extent such denomination in foreign currencies does occur  gains and losses on the conversion to us dollars of accounts receivable  accounts payable and other monetary assets and liabilities arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations 
although we may from time to time undertake foreign exchange hedging transactions to cover a portion of our foreign currency transaction exposure  we currently do not attempt to cover any foreign currency exposure 
if we are not successful in any future foreign exchange hedging transactions that we engage in  our business  operating results and financial condition could be harmed 
to manage our growth and expansion  we need to improve and implement our internal systems  procedures and controls 
if we are unable to do so successfully  our business would be seriously harmed 
our expansion in the scope of operations over the past few years has placed and will continue to place a significant strain on our management  information systems and resources 
any acquisitions made by us will also put a significant strain on our management  information systems and resources 
in addition  we expect that an expansion of our international operations will lead to increased financial and administrative demands associated with managing our international operations and managing an increasing number of relationships with foreign partners and customers and expanded treasury functions to manage foreign currency risks 
our future operating results will also depend on our ability to further develop indirect channels and expand our support organization to accommodate growth in our installed base 
if we fail to manage our expansion effectively  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
our executive officers and certain key personnel are critical to our business and these officers and key personnel may not remain with us in the future 
our future success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key engineering  sales  marketing and customer support personnel 
none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term 
if we lose the service of one or more of our key employees  or if one or more of our executive officers or key employees decide to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us  this could have a significant adverse effect on our business 
there are risks associated with the software industry the software industry is experiencing a significant downturn in connection with the decline in general economic conditions  which has resulted in a decrease of the budgets of our customers and potential customers for information technology 
this change in economic conditions has resulted in a slowdown of the purchase of internet based software products and has affected our operating results and financial condition 
we expect this economic downturn to continue and  thus  our operating results and financial condition may be below our forecasts and investor expectations and may in the future reflect substantial fluctuations from period to period as a consequence of buying patterns and general economic conditions in the software industry 

table of contents if our product contains material defects  our business could be seriously harmed 
software products as complex as those offered by us often contain errors or defects  particularly when first introduced  when new versions or enhancements are released and when configured to individual customer computing systems 
we currently have known errors and defects in our products 
despite testing conducted by us  if additional defects and errors are found in current versions  new versions or enhancements of our products after commencement of commercial shipment  this could result in the loss of revenues or a delay in market acceptance 
the occurrence of any of these events could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
if a successful product liability claim is made against us  our business would be seriously harmed 
although license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  it is possible that such limitation of liability provisions may not be effective as a result of existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions 
the sale and support of our products may entail the risk of such claims  which are likely to be substantial in light of the use of our products in business critical applications 
a product liability claim brought against us could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate  our business could be seriously harmed 
we have two issued and three pending us patents and we rely primarily on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology 
for example  we license our software pursuant to shrink wrap or signed license agreements  which impose certain restrictions on licensees ability to utilize the software 
in addition  we seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property  including requiring those persons with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 
we seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
if our means of protecting our proprietary rights is not adequate or our competitors independently develop similar technology  our business could be seriously harmed 
our common stock price may be volatile  which could result in substantial losses for stockholders 
the market price of shares of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and may be significantly affected by factors such as the following changes in the economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  terrorist attacks  war or the threat of war  developments in ongoing or threatened litigation  
table of contents announcements of technological innovations  new products or new contracts announced by us or our competitors  developments with respect to copyrights or proprietary rights  price and volume fluctuations in the stock market  changes in corporate purchasing of information applications software  the announcement of mergers or acquisitions  adoption of new accounting standards affecting the software industry  and changes in financial estimates by securities analysts 
in addition  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against such company 
if we are involved in such litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources and could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
changes in tax rates or negative tax rulings could adversely impact our financial results we are taxable principally in the united states and certain jurisdictions in europe and asia 
all of these jurisdictions have in the past and may in the future make changes to their corporate income tax rates and other income tax laws  which could increase our future income tax provision 
while we believe that all material income tax liabilities are reflected properly in our balance sheet  we have no assurance that we will prevail in all cases in the event the taxing authorities disagree with our interpretations of the tax law 
future levels of research and development spending will impact our entitlement to related tax credits  which generally lower our effective income tax rate 
future effective income tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have statutory tax rates lower than in the united states 
certain of our charter provisions and delaware law  may prevent or deter a change in control of actuate 
actuate s certificate of incorporation  as amended and restated the certificate of incorporation  and bylaws  as amended and restated bylaws  contain certain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control of actuate or unsolicited acquisition proposals that a stockholder might consider favorable  including provisions authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock and eliminating the ability of stockholders to act by written consent 
in addition  certain provisions of delaware law and our stock option plans may also have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control of actuate or unsolicited acquisition proposals 
the anti takeover effect of these provisions may also have an adverse effect on the public trading price of our common stock 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during fiscal years and  we derived of our total revenues from sales outside of north america while of our total revenues was derived from sales outside north america in fiscal year approximately of the revenues from our us operations are overseas sales and are denominated in us dollars 
our exposure to market risk on these receivables with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies is limited 
however  increases in the value of the us dollar could increase the price of our products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country and may result in a reduction in sales and profitability in that country 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations in fiscal year was not material 
actuate does not engage in hedging transactions 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality debt securities 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shift in the general level of us interest rates we invest in short term securities that have an average maturity of one year or less 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material risk exposure 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required
