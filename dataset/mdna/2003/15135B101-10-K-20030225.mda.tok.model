item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide managed care programs and related services to individuals receiving benefits under medicaid  including supplemental security income  or ssi  and the state children s health insurance program  or schip 
we have health plans in wisconsin  texas  indiana and new jersey 
on december   we acquired of the outstanding capital stock of university health plans  or uhp  from university of medicine and dentistry of new jersey  or umdnj  which continues to own the remaining capital stock of uhp 
uhp is a managed health plan operating in counties in new jersey 
we paid an aggregate purchase price of approximately million for our interest in uhp 
we entered into an investor rights agreement with umdnj providing that  among other things we have the right  exercisable at any time prior to september    to purchase the remaining shares of uhp held by umdnj for a cash purchase price of million 
if we do not exercise the right described above  the remaining shares of uhp held by umdnj will be exchanged on december  for a purchase price payable in either  at our election  shares of our common stock or cash 
the purchase price would equal the greater of a million or b the product of the enterprise value of uhp as of december  and the percentage of the outstanding uhp common stock on a fully diluted basis then represented by the shares owned by umdnj 
in june  superior healthplan entered into an agreement with texas universities health plan inc to purchase the schip contracts in three texas service areas 
effective september  october and november   the state of texas approved the contract sales between superior and texas universities health plan  thereby adding approximately  members to our texas health plan 
as a result of this transaction  was recorded as an intangible asset  purchased contract rights 
we are amortizing the contract rights on a straight line basis over five years  the period expected to be benefited 
revenues we generate revenues primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate to provide health benefits to our members 
we receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts 
we generally receive premiums during the month we provide services and recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members 
we also generate administrative services fees for providing services to ssi members on a non risk basis 
premiums collected in advance are recorded as unearned premiums 
premiums due to us are recorded as premium and related receivables and are recorded net of an allowance based on historical trends and our management s judgement on the collectibility of these accounts 
as we generally receive premiums during the month in which services are provided  the allowance is typically not significant in comparison to total premium revenue and does not have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial position or results of operations 
from to  however  we provided medicaid services in certain regions of indiana as a subcontractor with maxicare indiana  inc in june  the insurance commissioner of the indiana department of insurance declared maxicare insolvent and ordered maxicare into liquidation 
as a result  we recorded an allowance for uncollectible receivables in the amount of million to fully reserve for all receivables from maxicare as of december  in  subsequent to a release and settlement agreement with maxicare and the indiana insurance commissioner which requires no payment by either maxicare or us  we wrote off the entire balance of the receivable from maxicare as uncollectible and reduced the related allowance for doubtful accounts 
the primary driver of our increasing revenues has been membership growth 
we have increased our membership through both internal growth and acquisitions 
from december  to december   we increased our membership by 
the following table sets forth our membership by state december  wisconsin    texas    indiana    new jersey  total    the following table sets forth our membership by line of business december  medicaid excluding ssi    schip    ssi   total    in  our membership increased by  members in texas due to the purchase of schip contract rights from texas university health plan 
in addition  two smaller plans exited the austin  texas market 
as a result  our texas plan increased its membership by  lives 
this increase includes  lives that we are managing for the state of texas on an interim basis and that will become part of a reprocurement process scheduled for mid we entered the new jersey market through our acquisition of of the equity of uhp 
membership increases in our wisconsin and indiana markets resulted from additions to our provider network and growth in the number of medicaid beneficiaries 
in  our membership in indiana declined due to a subcontracting provider organization terminating a percent of premium arrangement  which was our only contract of that type 
separately  we entered into agreements with humana that resulted in the transfer to us of  members in wisconsin and  members in texas 
in  a competitor in our wisconsin market terminated its participation in the medicaid program benefiting our enrollment growth 
our membership growth in the northern and central regions of indiana was offset by our decision to reduce our participation in the southern region 
our el paso health plan achieved sizable growth because we were named the default health plan in this area and enrolled a majority of the members who failed to select a specific plan 
operating expenses our operating expenses include medical services costs and general and administrative expenses 
our medical services costs include payments to physicians  hospitals  and other providers for healthcare and specialty product claims 
medical service costs also include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported  or ibnr 
monthly  we estimate our ibnr based on a number of factors  including inpatient hospital utilization data and prior claims experience 
as part of this review  we also consider the costs to process medical claims and estimates of amounts to cover uncertainties related to fluctuations in physician billing patterns  membership  products and inpatient hospital trends 
these estimates are adjusted as more information becomes available 
we utilize the services of consultants who are contracted to review our estimates quarterly 
while we believe that our process for estimating ibnr is actuarially sound  we cannot assure you that healthcare claim costs will not exceed our estimates 
our results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses related to health benefits and to predict accurately costs incurred 
the table below depicts our health benefits ratio  which represents medical services costs as a percentage of premium revenues and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided 
our stabilization in the ratio primarily reflects improved provider contract terms  premium rate increases in our markets served and member reductions in our southern indiana market 
year ended december  health benefits ratio our general and administrative expenses primarily reflect wages and benefits and other administrative costs related to our employee base  including those fees incurred to provide services to our members 
some of these services are provided locally  while others are delivered to our health plans from a centralized location 
this approach provides the opportunity to control both direct and indirect costs 
the major centralized functions are claims processing  information systems  finance  medical management support and administration 
the following table sets forth the general and administrative expense ratio  which represents general and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenues and reflects the relationship between revenues earned and the costs necessary to drive those revenues 
year ended december  general and administrative expenses ratio the improvement in the general and administrative expenses ratio reflects growth in membership and leveraging of our overall infrastructure 
for example  the decrease in our general and administrative ratio over the past two years in part reflects our efforts to increase claims processing efficiencies through our centralized support functions 
as a result  our days in claims payable  which is a calculation of medical claims liabilities at the end of the quarter divided by average claims expense per calendar day for such quarter  decreased from days at december  to at december  net of the effects of our acquisition of of the capital stock of uhp on december   our days in claims payable at december  would have been days 
other income expense other income expense consists principally of investment and other income  interest expense and equity in earnings losses from joint ventures 
investment income is derived from our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
information about our investments is presented below under liquidity and capital resources 
interest expense reported in represents commitment fees paid to a bank in conjunction with our undrawn credit facility 
interest expense reported in and primarily reflected interest paid on our subordinated notes  which we repaid in full in december equity in earnings losses from joint ventures principally represented our share of operating results from superior healthplan  which we formed with community health centers network in from through  we owned of superior  and therefore accounted for the investment under the equity method of accounting 
effective january   we entered into an agreement to purchase an additional of superior 
we also agreed to purchase from tachc gp  inc a term note pursuant to which superior owed tachc  as a result of entering into this agreement  we began accounting for our investment in superior using consolidation accounting 
we therefore no longer reflect any operations of superior in equity in earnings losses from joint ventures and we eliminate in consolidation all administrative fees from superior 
in addition  in december we acquired the remaining equity interest in superior in exchange for  shares of our common stock 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
two of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
medical claims liabilities our medical services costs include estimates for claims received but not yet adjudicated  estimates for claims incurred but not yet received and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims 
we  together with our independent actuaries  estimate medical claims liabilities using actuarial methods based upon historical data for payment patterns  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors 
these estimates are continually reviewed and adjustments  if necessary  are reflected in the period known 
in applying this policy  our management uses its judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the determination of the required estimates 
while we believe these estimates are appropriate  it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates 
the estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
the change in medical claims liabilities is summarized as follows balance  january    acquisitions   incurred related to current year    prior years    total incurred    paid related to current year    prior years    total paid    balance  december    acquisitions in include reserves acquired in connection with our acquisition of of the outstanding capital stock of uhp 
acquisitions in include reserves acquired in connection with our acquisition of the remaining shares of superior healthplan 
changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years recognized during  and were attributable to favorable development in all of our markets  including lower than anticipated utilization of medical services 
intangible assets we have made several acquisitions over the past two years that collectively have resulted in our recording of a significant amount of intangible assets 
these intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in purchase transactions and consist of purchased contract rights  provider contracts and goodwill 
purchased contract rights are amortized using the straight line method over periods ranging from to months 
provider contracts are amortized using the straight line method over months 
our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
impairment of an intangible asset is triggered when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges do not exceed the carrying amount of the intangible asset and related goodwill 
if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset and goodwill may be permanently impaired  the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset and goodwill and the fair value of such asset determined using the estimated future discounted cash flows excluding interest charges generated from the use and ultimate disposition of the respective acquired entity 
our management must make assumptions and estimates  such as the discount factor  in determining the estimated fair values 
while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate  other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 
effective january   we ceased to amortize goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment 
in addition  we will perform an impairment analysis of intangible assets more frequently based on other factors 
these factors would include significant changes in membership  state funding  medical contracts and provider networks and contracts 
we did not recognize any impairment losses during  or results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues premiums for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in this increase was due to organic growth in our existing markets  the purchase of the texas schip contracts and the inclusion of one month of revenues of uhp 
in addition  we received premium rate increases ranging from to  or on composite basis across our markets 
administrative services fees for the year ended december  increased  or  to  from  in this increase resulted from increases in our non risk ssi membership in our texas market 
operating expenses medical services costs for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in this increase reflected the growth in our membership 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in this increase reflected a higher level of wages and related expenses for additional staff to support our membership growth 
other income other income for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in a majority of the increase is due to the receipt of a one time dividend of million from a captive insurance company in which we maintained an investment 
in addition  investment income increased due to a larger amount of dollars invested  and interest expense decreased year over year due to the repayment of our subordinated debt in december income tax expense for the year ended december  we recorded income tax expense of million  or an effective tax rate of 
this compares to million  or an effective tax rate of  for the year ended december  our effective tax rate decreased year over year due to our investment in tax advantaged securities and our implementation of state tax saving strategies during year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues premiums for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in this increase was due to the humana contract purchases  the consolidation of our el paso market and membership growth  net of the termination of our indiana sub contract arrangement 
administrative services fees for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to  from million in as a result of our acquisition of a majority share of superior healthplan  as described above 
operating expenses medical services costs for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in this increase was due to the humana contract purchases  the consolidation of our el paso market and membership growth  net of the termination of our indiana sub contract arrangement 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in this increase primarily was due to a higher level of wages and related expenses for additional staff to support our membership growth 
other income other income for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from  in this primarily reflected a significant increase in investment income due to an increase in cash  cash equivalents and investments 
the increase also reflected the consolidation of our el paso market due to our increased ownership 
income tax expense for the year ended december   we recorded income tax expense of million based on a effective tax rate 
for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of  primarily as a result of the reversal of our valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources on may   we closed a follow on public offering of  shares of common stock at per share 
of the  shares   shares were offered by selling stockholders and  by us 
on june   the underwriters of our follow on public offering exercised their over allotment option to purchase  additional shares from selling stockholders and  shares from us 
we received net proceeds of million from the two closings of the follow on offering 
on december   we closed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock at per share 
we received net proceeds of million 
prior to this offering  we financed our operations and growth through private equity and debt financings and internally generated funds  raising million between and this consisted of million through the issuance of equity securities and million through subordinated debt financing 
our operating activities provided cash of million in  million in and million in the increases in and were due to further improved profitability  an increase in membership and the timing of capitation payments 
our investing activities used cash of million in  provided cash of million in and used cash of million in our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity  preserve capital and maximize total return on invested assets within our investment guidelines 
net cash provided by and used in investing activities will fluctuate from year to year due to the timing of investment purchases  sales and maturities 
as of december   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities with an average duration of years 
cash is invested in investment vehicles such as municipal bonds  commercial paper  us government backed agencies and us treasury instruments 
the states in which we operate prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest their cash 
the average portfolio yield was as of december  and as of december   exclusive of a one time dividend of million from a captive insurance company in which we maintained an investment 
our financing activities used cash of million in and provided cash of million in and million in during  financing cash flows consisted of borrowings and repayments under a credit facility and issuances of preferred stock 
during  financing cash flows primarily consisted of the issuance of common stock through our initial public offering net of the repayment of subordinated notes with million of our proceeds 
during  financing cash flows primarily consisted of the issuance of common stock through our follow on offering  the exercise of the over allotment and proceeds received from the exercise of stock options 
we may use our existing funds  including proceeds from our two public offerings  to make strategic acquisitions including medicaid and schip businesses  contract rights and related assets to increase our membership and to expand our business into new service areas 
in  we purchased the capital stock of bankers reserve life insurance company of wisconsin for  net of assets and liabilities acquired  and the rights to texas universities health plan s schip contracts for  in addition  we purchased of the outstanding capital stock of uhp for million 
in  we purchased the rights to the humana medicaid contracts with the states of texas and wisconsin for million 
in  we spent million on capital assets consisting primarily of new software  software and hardware upgrades  furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements related to office and market expansions 
in  we purchased million of furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements due to the addition of the austin and san antonio markets and the expansion of the wisconsin market 
we anticipate spending million on additional capital expenditures in related to office and market expansions and system upgrades 
our principal contractual obligations at december  consisted of obligations under operating leases 
the significant annual noncancelable lease payments over the next five years and beyond are as follows in thousands payment due thereafter  in addition  we will acquire the remaining equity of uhp by no later than december   as described under management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations overview 
in may  we entered into a million revolving line of credit facility with lasalle bank na the line of credit has a term of one year and has interest rates based on prime  floating and libor rates 
we granted a security interest in the common stock of our subsidiaries 
the facility includes financial covenants  including requirements of minimum ebitda and minimum tangible net worth 
we are required to obtain lasalle s consent of any proposed acquisition that would result in a violation of any of the covenants contained in the line of credit 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants and no funds had been drawn on the facility 
at december   we had working capital of million as compared to million at december  and million at december  our working capital is negative at times due to our efforts to increase investment returns through purchases of long term investments  which have maturities of greater than one year and  therefore  are classified as long term 
our investment policies are also designed to provide liquidity and preserve capital 
we manage our short term and long term investments to ensure that a sufficient portion is held in investments that are highly liquid and can be sold to fund working capital as needed 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  and million at december  long term investments were million at december  and million at december   including restricted deposits of million and million  respectively 
cash and investments held by our unregulated entities totaled million at december  based on our operating plan  we expect that our cash  cash equivalents and investments  cash from our operations and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our operations and capital expenditures for at least months from the date of this report 
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries  most of which are subject to state regulations that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  additional regulations and restrict the timing  payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us 
our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate 
as of december   our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of million  compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus of million 
the national association of insurance commissioners adopted guidelines which set minimum risk based capital requirements for insurance companies  managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage 
wisconsin and texas adopted various forms of the rules as of december  as of december  our wisconsin and texas health plans were in compliance with risk based capital requirements 
the managed care organization rules  if adopted by indiana and new jersey  may increase the minimum capital required for these subsidiaries 
we continue to monitor these requirements and do not expect that they will have a material impact on earnings or cash flows 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  was issued which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested at least annually for impairment 
we have adopted sfas no 
effective january   and goodwill amortization was discontinued 
for the year ended december   this adjustment would have added  in net earnings  or per diluted share and per basic share 
for the year ended december   this adjustment would have added  in net earnings  or per diluted share and per basic share

the state of wisconsin  however  does not calculate or request payment for the amount owed until at least thirteen months subsequent to each year end 
as such  the company has recorded a current payable for any portions owed within one year and a long term liability for portions owed for a period greater than one year from the balance sheet date

forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements that relate to future events or our future financial performance 
we have attempted to identify these statements by terminology including believe  anticipate  plan  expect  estimate  intend  seek  goal  may  will  should  can  continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
these statements include statements about our market opportunity  our growth strategy  competition  expected activities and future acquisitions and investments  and the adequacy of our available cash resources 
these statements may be found in the sections of this report entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business 
readers are cautioned that matters subject to forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties  including economic  regulatory  competitive and other factors that may cause our or our industry s actual results  levels of activity  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
actual results may differ from projections or estimates due to a variety of important factors 
our results of operations and projections of future earnings depend in large part on accurately predicting and effectively managing health benefits and other operating expenses 
a variety of factors  including competition  changes in health care practices  changes in federal or state laws and regulations or their interpretations  inflation  provider contract changes  new technologies  government imposed surcharges  taxes or assessments  reduction in provider payments by governmental payers  major epidemics  disasters and numerous other factors affecting the delivery and cost of healthcare  such as major healthcare providers inability to maintain their operations  may in the future affect our ability to control our medical costs and other operating expenses 
governmental action or business conditions could result in premium revenues not increasing to offset any increase in medical costs and other operating expenses 
once set  premiums are generally fixed for one year periods and  accordingly  unanticipated costs during such periods cannot be recovered through higher premiums 
the expiration  cancellation or suspension of our medicaid managed care contracts by the state governments would also negatively impact us 
due to these factors and risks  we cannot give assurances with respect to our future premium levels or our ability to control our future medical costs 
factors that may affect future results risks related to being a regulated entity reductions in medicaid funding could substantially reduce our profitability 
nearly all of our revenues come from medicaid premiums 
the base premium rate paid by each state differs  depending on a combination of factors such as defined upper payment limits  a member s health status  age  gender  county or region  benefit mix and member eligibility categories 
future levels of medicaid premium rates may be affected by continued government efforts to contain medical costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints 
changes to medicaid programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible  reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels  or increase our administrative or healthcare costs under those programs 
states periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid 
we believe that additional reductions in medicaid payments could substantially reduce our profitability 
further  our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state immediately or after a short notice period in the event of unavailability of state funds 
if our medicaid and schip contracts are terminated or are not renewed  our business will suffer 
we provide managed care programs and select services to individuals receiving benefits under medicaid  including ssi and schip 
we provide these healthcare services under contracts with regulatory entities in the areas in which we operate 
the contracts expire on various dates between june  and december  our contracts with the states of indiana and wisconsin accounted for of our revenues for the year ended december  our contracts may be terminated if we fail to perform up to the standards set by state regulatory agencies 
in addition  the indiana contract under which we operate can be terminated by the state without cause 
our contracts are generally intended to run for two years and may be extended for one or two additional years if the state or its contractor elects to do so 
when our contracts expire  they may be opened for bidding by competing healthcare providers 
there is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended 
if any of our contracts is terminated  not renewed  or renewed on less favorable terms  our business will suffer  and our operating results may be materially affected 
changes in government regulations designed to protect providers and members rather than our stockholders could force us to change how we operate and could harm our business 
our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by the federal government 
the applicable laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and generally are intended to benefit and protect health plan providers and members rather than stockholders 
changes in existing laws and rules  the enactment of new laws and rules  and changing interpretations of these laws and rules could  among other things force us to restructure our relationships with providers within our network  require us to implement additional or different programs and systems  mandate minimum medical expense levels as a percentage of premiums revenues  restrict revenue and enrollment growth  require us to develop plans to guard against the financial insolvency of our providers  increase our healthcare and administrative costs  impose additional capital and reserve requirements  and increase or change our liability to members in the event of malpractice by our providers 
for example  congress has considered various forms of patient protection legislation commonly known as patients bills of rights 
we cannot predict the impact of this legislation  if adopted  on our business 
regulations may decrease the profitability of our health plans 
our texas plans are required to pay a rebate to the state in the event profits exceed established levels 
to date no rebates have been required 
this regulatory requirement  changes in this requirement or the adoption of similar requirements by our other regulators may limit our ability to increase our overall profits as a percentage of revenues 
the state of texas has implemented and is enforcing a penalty provision for failure to pay claims in a timely manner 
failure to meet this requirement can result in financial fines and penalties 
in addition  states may attempt to reduce their contract premium rates if regulators perceive our medical loss ratio as too low 
any of these regulatory actions could harm our operating results 
also  on january   cms published a final rule that removed an exception contained in the federal medicaid reimbursement regulations permitting states to reimburse non state government owned or operated hospitals for inpatient and outpatient hospital services at amounts up to percent of a reasonable estimate of the amount that would be paid for the services furnished by these hospitals under medicaid payment principles 
this development in federal law could decrease the profitability of our health plans 
failure to comply with government regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties 
federal and state governments have enacted fraud and abuse laws and other laws to protect patients privacy and access to healthcare 
violation of these and other laws or regulations governing our operations or the operations of our providers could result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties  the cancellation of our contracts to provide services  the suspension or revocation of our licenses or our exclusion from participating in the medicaid  ssi and schip programs 
because of these potential sanctions  we seek to monitor our compliance and that of our providers with federal and state fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws on an ongoing basis 
these penalties or exclusions  were they to occur as the result of our actions or omissions  or our inability to monitor the compliance of our providers  would negatively impact our ability to operate our business 
for example  failure to pay our providers promptly could result in the imposition of fines and other penalties 
in some states  we may be subject to regulation by more than one governmental authority  which may impose overlapping or inconsistent regulations 
hipaa broadened the scope of fraud and abuse laws applicable to healthcare companies 
hipaa created civil penalties for  among other things  billing for medically unnecessary goods or services 
hipaa established new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse  including a whistle blower program 
further  hipaa imposes civil and  in some instances  criminal penalties for failure to comply with specific standards relating to the privacy  security and electronic transmission of individually identifiable health information 
congress may enact additional legislation to increase penalties and to create a private right of action under hipaa  which would entitle patients to seek monetary damages for violations of the privacy rules 
compliance with new government regulations may require us to make significant expenditures 
in august  hhs issued a new regulation under hipaa requiring the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically 
we are required to comply with the new regulation by october  and texas has indicated that it may impose an earlier compliance deadline 
in august  hhs proposed a regulation that would require healthcare participants to implement organizational and technical practices to protect the security of electronically maintained or transmitted health related information 
in december  hhs issued a new regulation mandating heightened privacy and confidentiality protections under hipaa that became effective on april  compliance with this regulation will be required by april  the bush administration s issuance of new regulations and its review of existing regulations  the states ability to promulgate stricter rules  and uncertainty regarding many aspects of the regulations may make compliance with the relatively new regulatory landscape difficult 
our existing programs and systems may not enable us to comply in all respects with these new regulations 
in order to comply with the regulatory requirements  we will be required to employ additional or different programs and systems  the costs of which are not expected to exceed  in further  compliance with these regulations would require changes to many of the procedures we currently use to conduct our business  which may lead to additional costs that we have not yet identified 
we do not know whether  or the extent to which  we will be able to recover our costs of complying with these new regulations from the states 
the new regulations and the related compliance costs could have a material adverse effect on our business 
changes in healthcare law may reduce our profitability 
numerous proposals relating to changes in healthcare law have been introduced  some of which have been passed by congress and the states in which we operate or may operate in the future 
changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered  and interpretations of existing laws and rules may also change from time to time 
we are unable to predict what regulatory changes may occur or what effect any particular change may have on our business 
these changes could reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for medicaid and reduce the reimbursement or payment levels for medical services 
more generally  we are unable to predict whether new laws or proposals will favor or hinder the growth of managed healthcare 
we cannot predict the outcome of these legislative or regulatory proposals or the effect that they will have on us 
legislation or regulations that require us to change our current manner of operation  provide additional benefits or change our contract arrangements may seriously harm our operations and financial results 
changes in federal funding mechanisms may reduce our profitability 
in february  the bush administration proposed a major long term change in the way medicaid and schip are funded 
the proposal  if adopted  would allow states to elect to receive combined medicaid schip allotments for acute and long term health care for low income  uninsured persons 
participating states would be given flexibility in designing their own health insurance programs  subject to federally mandated minimum coverage requirements 
it is uncertain whether this proposal will be enacted  or if so  how it may change from the initial proposal 
accordingly  it is unknown whether or how many states might elect to participate or how their participation may affect the net amount of funding available for medicaid and schip programs 
if such a proposal is adopted and decreases the number of persons enrolled in medicaid or schip in the states in which we operate or reduces the volume of health care services provided  our growth  operations and financial performance could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to participate in schip programs  our growth rate may be limited 
schip is a relatively new federal initiative designed to provide coverage for low income children not otherwise covered by medicaid or other insurance programs 
the programs vary significantly from state to state 
participation in schip programs is an important part of our growth strategy 
if states do not allow us to participate or if we fail to win bids to participate  our growth strategy may be materially and adversely affected 
if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our subsidiaries to us  we may not have sufficient funds to implement our business strategy 
we principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries 
if funds normally available to us become limited in the future  we may need to rely on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations 
these subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of  or notification to  state regulators 
if these regulators were to deny our subsidiaries request to pay dividends to us  the funds available to our company as a whole would be limited 
this could harm our ability to implement our business strategy 
risks related to our business receipt of inadequate premiums would negatively affect our revenues and profitability 
nearly all of our revenues are generated by premiums consisting of fixed monthly payments per member 
these premiums are fixed by contract  and we are obligated during the contract periods to provide healthcare services as established by the state governments 
we use a large portion of our revenues to pay the costs of healthcare services delivered to our customers 
if premiums do not increase when expenses related to medical services rise  our earnings would be affected negatively 
in addition  our actual medical services costs may exceed our estimates  which would cause our health benefits ratio  or our expenses related to medical services as a percentage of premium revenues  to increase and our profits to decline 
in addition  it is possible for a state to increase the rates payable to the hospitals without granting a corresponding increase in premiums to us 
if this were to occur in one or more of the states in which we operate  our profitability would be harmed 
failure to effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs would reduce our profitability 
our profitability depends  to a significant degree  on our ability to predict and effectively manage expenses related to health benefits 
we have less control over the costs related to medical services than we do over our general and administrative expenses 
historically  our health benefits ratio has varied 
for example  our health benefits ratio was for  for and for  but was for and for because of the narrow margins of our health plan business  relatively small changes in our health benefits ratio can create significant changes in our financial results 
changes in healthcare regulations and practices  the level of use of healthcare services  hospital costs  pharmaceutical costs  major epidemics  new medical technologies and other external factors  including general economic conditions such as inflation levels  are beyond our control and could reduce our ability to predict and effectively control the costs of providing health benefits 
we may not be able to manage costs effectively in the future 
if our costs related to health benefits increase  our profits could be reduced or we may not remain profitable 
failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our reported results 
our medical expenses include estimates of ibnr 
we estimate our ibnr medical expenses monthly based on a number of factors 
adjustments  if necessary  are made to medical expenses in the period during which the actual claim costs are ultimately determined or when criteria used to estimate ibnr change 
we cannot be sure that our ibnr estimates are adequate or that adjustments to those estimates will not harm our results of operations 
from time to time in the past  our actual results have varied from our estimates  particularly in times of significant changes in the number of our members 
our failure to accurately estimate ibnr may also affect our ability to take timely corrective actions  further harming our results 
difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our business 
historically  the acquisition of medicaid businesses  contract rights and related assets of other health plans both in our existing service areas and in new markets  has accounted for a significant amount of our growth 
for example  our acquisition of of the equity of uhp on december   accounted for of the increase in our membership for the year ended december  compared to many of the other potential purchasers of medicaid assets have greater financial resources than we have 
in addition  many of the sellers are interested either in selling  along with their medicaid assets  other assets in which we do not have an interest or selling their companies  including their liabilities  as opposed to the assets of their ongoing businesses 
we generally are required to obtain regulatory approval from one or more state agencies when making acquisitions 
in the case of an acquisition of a business located in a state in which we do not currently operate  we would be required to obtain the necessary licenses to operate in that state 
in addition  even if we may already operate in a state in which we acquire a new business  we would be required to obtain additional regulatory approval if the acquisition would result in our operating in an area of the state in which we did not operate previously 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to comply with these regulatory requirements for an acquisition in a timely manner  or at all 
in deciding whether to approve a proposed acquisition  state regulators may consider a number of factors outside our control  including giving preference to competing offers made by locally owned entities or by not for profit entities 
furthermore  our credit facility may prohibit some acquisitions without the consent of our bank lender 
in addition to the difficulties we may face in identifying and consummating acquisitions  we will also be required to integrate and consolidate any acquired business or assets with our existing operations 
this may include the integration of additional personnel who are not familiar with our operations and corporate culture  existing provider networks  which may operate on different terms than our existing networks  existing members  who may decide to switch to another healthcare plan  and disparate administrative  accounting and finance  and information systems 
accordingly  we may be unable to successfully identify  consummate and integrate future acquisitions or operate acquired businesses profitably 
we also may be unable to obtain sufficient additional capital resources for future acquisitions 
if we are unable to effectively execute our acquisition strategy  our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed 
failure to achieve timely profitability in any business would negatively affect our results of operations 
start up costs associated with a new business can be substantial 
for example  in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions  we must first establish a provider network  have systems in place and demonstrate our ability to obtain a state contract and process claims 
if we were unsuccessful in obtaining the necessary license  winning the bid to provide service or attracting members in numbers sufficient to cover our costs  any new business of ours would fail 
we also could be obligated by the state to continue to provide services for some period of time without sufficient revenue to cover our ongoing costs or recover start up costs 
in addition  we may not be able to effectively commercialize any new programs or services we seek to market to third parties 
the expenses associated with starting up a new business could have a significant impact on our results of operations if we are unable to achieve profitable operations in a timely fashion 
we derive all of our revenues from operations in four states  and our operating results would be materially affected by a decrease in revenues or profitability in any one of those states 
operations in wisconsin  indiana  texas and new jersey account for all of our revenues 
if we were unable to continue to operate in each of those states or if our current operations in any portion of one of those states were significantly curtailed  our revenues would decrease materially 
in the first half of  our membership in indiana declined by approximately  due to a subcontracting provider organization terminating a percent of premium arrangement 
in  we reduced our service area in wisconsin from to counties 
our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenue and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly  depending on legislative actions  economic conditions and similar factors in those states 
our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we operate would harm our business 
competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve 
we compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider network  benefits provided and quality of service 
we compete with numerous types of competitors  including other health plans and traditional state medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided 
subject to limited exceptions by federally approved state applications  the federal government requires that there be choices for medicaid recipients among managed care programs 
voluntary programs and mandated competition may limit our ability to increase our market share 
some of the health plans with which we compete have greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do 
in addition  significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care industry  as well as in industries that act as suppliers to us  such as the hospital  physician  pharmaceutical  medical device and health information systems industries 
to the extent that competition intensifies in any market that we serve  our ability to retain or increase members and providers  or maintain or increase our revenue growth  pricing flexibility and control over medical cost trends may be adversely affected 
in addition  in order to increase our membership in the markets we currently serve  we believe that we must continue to develop and implement community specific products  alliances with key providers and localized outreach and educational programs 
if we are unable to develop and implement these initiatives  or if our competitors are more successful than we are in doing so  we may not be able to further penetrate our existing markets 
if we are unable to maintain satisfactory relationships with our provider networks  our profitability will be harmed 
our profitability depends  in large part  upon our ability to contract favorably with hospitals  physicians and other healthcare providers 
our provider arrangements with our primary care physicians  specialists and hospitals generally may be cancelled by either party without cause upon to days prior written notice 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts enabling us to service our members profitably 
from time to time providers assert or threaten to assert claims seeking to terminate noncancelable agreements due to alleged actions or inactions by us 
even if these allegations represent attempts to avoid or renegotiate contractual terms that have become economically disadvantageous to the providers  it is possible that in the future a provider may pursue such a claim successfully 
regardless of whether any claims brought against us are successful or have merit  they will still be time consuming and costly and could distract our management s attention 
as a result  we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 
we will be required to establish acceptable provider networks prior to entering new markets 
we may be unable to enter into agreements with providers in new markets on a timely basis or under favorable terms 
if we are unable to retain our current provider contracts or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms  our profitability will be harmed 
we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 
we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our medicaid managed care business 
if we lose one or more members of our senior management team  including our chief executive officer  michael f 
neidorff  who has been instrumental in developing our mission and forging our business relationships  our business and operating results could be harmed 
we do not have an employment agreement with mr 
neidorff  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain his services 
our ability to replace any departed members of our senior management or other key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the medicaid managed care industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and expand successfully a business such as ours 
competition to hire from this limited pool is intense  and we may be unable to hire  train  retain or motivate these personnel 
negative publicity regarding the managed care industry may harm our business and operating results 
recently  the managed care industry has received negative publicity 
this publicity has led to increased legislation  regulation  review of industry practices and private litigation in the commercial sector 
these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our services  require us to change our services  and increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate 
any of these factors may increase the costs of doing business and adversely affect our operating results 
claims relating to medical malpractice could cause us to incur significant expenses 
our providers and employees involved in medical care decisions may be subject to medical malpractice claims 
some states  including texas  have adopted legislation that permits managed care organizations to be held liable for negligent treatment decisions or benefits coverage determinations 
in addition  plaintiffs in cases pending in federal courts are seeking to hold managed care organizations liable for denying medically necessary treatment and denying or delaying payments for services performed 
claims of this nature  if successful  could result in substantial damage awards against us and our providers that could exceed the limits of any applicable insurance coverage 
therefore  successful malpractice or tort claims asserted against us  our providers or our employees could adversely affect our financial condition and profitability 
even if any claims brought against us are unsuccessful or without merit  they would still be time consuming and costly and could distract our management s attention 
as a result  we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 
growth in the number of medicaid eligible persons during economic downturns could cause our operating results and stock prices to suffer if state and federal budgets decrease or do not increase 
less favorable economic conditions may cause our membership to increase as more people become eligible to receive medicaid benefits 
during such economic downturns  however  state and federal budgets could decrease  causing states to attempt to cut healthcare programs  benefits and rates 
in particular  we cannot predict the impact of acts of terrorism or related military action on federal or state funding of healthcare programs or on the size of the medicaid eligible population 
if federal funding were decreased or unchanged while our membership was increasing  our results of operations would suffer 
growth in the number of medicaid eligible persons may be countercyclical  which could cause our operating results to suffer when general economic conditions are improving 
historically  the number of persons eligible to receive medicaid benefits has increased more rapidly during periods of rising unemployment  corresponding to less favorable general economic conditions 
conversely  this number may grow more slowly or even decline if economic conditions improve 
therefore  improvements in general economic conditions may cause our membership levels to decrease  thereby causing our operating results to suffer  which could lead to decreases in our stock price during periods in which stock prices in general are increasing 
we intend to expand primarily into markets where medicaid recipients are required to enroll in managed care plans 
we expect to continue to focus our business in states in which medicaid enrollment in managed care is mandatory 
currently  approximately two thirds of the states require health plan enrollment for medicaid eligible participants in all or a portion of their counties 
the programs are voluntary in other states 
because we concentrate on markets with mandatory enrollment  we expect the geographic expansion of our business to be limited to those states 
if we are unable to integrate and manage our information systems effectively  our operations could be disrupted 
our operations depend significantly on effective information systems 
the information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in  among other things  monitoring utilization and other cost factors  processing provider claims  and providing data to our regulators 
our providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications  claims status and other information 
our information systems and applications require continual maintenance  upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs 
moreover  our acquisition activity requires frequent transitions to or from  and the integration of  various information systems 
we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities 
if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or are unable to properly maintain or expand our information systems  we could suffer  among other things  from operational disruptions  loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members  regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses 
in addition  our ability to integrate and manage our information systems may be impaired as the result of events outside our control  including acts of nature  such as earthquakes or fires  or acts of terrorists 
we may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate insurance 
we maintain liability insurance  subject to limits and deductibles  for claims that could result from providing or failing to provide managed care and related services 
these claims could be substantial 
we believe that our present insurance coverage and reserves are adequate to cover currently estimated exposures 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs or that we will not incur significant liabilities in excess of policy limits 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investments as of december   we had short term investments of million and long term investments of million  including restricted deposits of million 
the short term investments consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and months 
the long term investments consist of municipal bonds  us government backed agencies and us treasury investments  and have original maturities greater than one year 
restricted deposits consist of investments required by various state statutes to be deposited or pledged to state agencies 
these investments are classified as long term regardless of the contractual maturity date due to the nature of the state s requirements 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
we have the ability to hold these short term investments to maturity  and as a result  we would not expect the value of these investments to decline significantly as a result of a sudden change in market interest rates 
assuming a hypothetical and immediate increase in market interest rates at december   the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately million 
similarly  a decrease in market interest rates at december  would result in an increase of the fair value of our investments of approximately million 
declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income 
inflation although the general rate of inflation has remained relatively stable and healthcare cost inflation has stabilized in recent years  the national healthcare cost inflation rate still exceeds the general inflation rate 
we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation 
specifically  our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through contracts with independent providers of healthcare services 
through these contracted care providers  our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 
while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate healthcare cost inflation will continue to be successful  competitive pressures  new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions  demands from healthcare providers and customers  applicable regulations or other factors may affect our ability to control the impact of healthcare cost increases 
compliance costs federal and state regulations governing standards for electronic transactions  data security and confidentiality of patient information have been issued recently 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the regulatory requirements  we cannot be sure that the systems and programs that we have implemented will comply adequately with the regulations that are ultimately adopted 
implementation of additional systems and programs will be required  the cost of which we estimate not to exceed  in further  compliance with these regulations would require changes to many of the procedures we currently use to conduct our business  which may lead to additional costs that we have not yet identified 
we do not know whether  or the extent to which  we will be able to recover our costs of complying with these new regulations from the states
