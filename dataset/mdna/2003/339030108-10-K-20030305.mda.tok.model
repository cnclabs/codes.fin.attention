item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is part of our annual report on form k to the securities and exchange commission  or sec  and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this report 
certain prior period amounts presented in this discussion and analysis have been reclassified to conform to current period classifications 
this discussion and analysis may contain statements with respect to our financial condition  results of operations  future performance and business that are considered forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of actual results may differ materially from those anticipated as a result of certain risks  uncertainties and other factors  which are more fully discussed under item of this report 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments in the application of certain of its accounting policies that involve significant estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates and assumptions  which are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  may materially impact the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as the information changes over time 
accordingly  different amounts could be reported as a result of the use of revised estimates and assumptions in the application of these accounting policies 
the accounting policies considered relatively more significant in this respect are the determination of the reserve for credit losses  the valuation of principal investing securities  accounting for goodwill and accounting for income taxes 
these accounting policies are discussed in the significant accounting policies section of this discussion and analy

table of contents line of business information we are managed along a customer focused organizational structure that includes four lines of business commercial financial services  personal financial services  capital markets and international banking 
business line results are subject to periodic restatements based on modifications to management accounting methodology  profitability measurement enhancements and organizational changes 
accordingly  information presented in this sec tion for the year ended december  has been restated for comparative purposes to reflect the implementation of management reporting modifications and changes in organizational structure in the table below highlights our segment results and is presented on a fully taxable equivalent  or fte  and continuing operations basis

while we provide expertise in industry specialties  commercial real estate  leasing  asset based lending  and debt capital  our extensive range of products and services allows us to have a much broader role in our customers financial strategies 
our products and services include cash management  loan syndications  global trade services  foreign exchange  interest rate risk management  mergers and acquisitions  and retirement plan services 
cash management services continues to be an area of strength and growth for us 
we are the fifth largest provider of cash management services in the us and provide our customers with tools necessary to manage their treasury operations 
commercial financial services earned billion in  a decrease of million from the prior year 
earnings from the underlying business units reflected reduced demand for commercial loans and capital markets products as the economic environment remained weak 
in addition  commercial financial services results reflected the impact of our ongoing risk reduction strategy  under which targeted  non strategic exposures  composed of both funded loans and unfunded commitments to extend credit  have been reduced by billion  or  over the past two years 
this includes the impact of the billion exposure reduction program announced in april that was completed in the fourth quarter of we anticipate further reductions in exposure in higher cash management fees and deposit balances  resulting from higher sales and cross selling activities  combined with the impact of cost saving initiatives initially implemented in  helped to moderate the negative impact of the weak economic climate 
expense management continues to be a focus in commercial financial services operating expenses declined million  or  compared to and reflected the impact of incentive compensation reductions that corresponded with lower revenue levels in the group 
as we more fully explain in the all other portion of this line of business information section  provisions for credit losses are generally allocated to commercial financial services and our other lines of business on an expected loss basis over an economic cycle 
this method of allocating provisions for credit losses to the business lines differs from the method used to determine our consolidated provision for credit losses for any given period 

table of contents in accordance with this methodology  in the second and fourth quarters of  we recorded  in all other  consolidated pre tax provisions totaling million  primarily reflecting the impact of us economic conditions on commercial credit  specifically the ongoing deterioration within commercial financial services lending portfolios 
including the after tax impact of these provisions currently  instead of prospectively over the economic cycle  earnings of commercial financial services would have been million  a reduction of from the prior year level  and the related return on equity would have been

this decline was driven by decreases in loan volumes resulting  in part  from repositioning of the portfolio to reduce credit exposure  and by lower trading revenues due to market conditions 
this decline was partially offset by higher cash management fees and lower compensation levels 
average loans and leases were billion in  compared to billion in  a decline of billion  or 
commercial banking and financial services  which is composed of our middle market lending  small business and government banking businesses  earned million in  an increase of million  or  from the prior year 
the increase in net income was driven by increased deposit balances  higher tax processing revenues  a higher level of cash management fees and derivative sales 
these earnings  combined with lower operating expenses resulting from cost saving initiatives implemented in  more than offset the impact of reduced loan demand 
average loan balances decreased billion to billion  while deposits grew approximately billion to billion  when compared to the prior year

consumer financial services provides consumer retail banking and investment services to more than million households 
customers can access products and services through a variety of distribution channels including a network of approximately  branches and  atms  electronic banking products  internet banking homelink  and customer call centers that provide our customers with convenience 
homelink continues to grow at a rapid pace with million customers  up from million customers last year

we offer retirement planning  large institutional asset management  and not for profit investment services 
retail brokerage services and securities and clearing activities are provided through quick reilly  a leading provider of these services 
we now operate more than quick reilly investor centers with  financial consultants 
personal financial services earned billion in  a decline of million  or  from the prior year 
included in results were gains from the sale of our equity interest in the nyce atm network and gains from the sale of non strategic branches 
excluding these prior year one time transactions  the segment had a increase in earnings 
this improvement in earnings was driven by solid loan growth  particularly in home equity products and credit card receivables  and strong growth in low cost core deposits  partially offset by the impact of lower deposit spreads and a decline in the market value of assets under management 
year ended december dollars in millions net income total revenue return on equity consumer financial services wealth management and brokerage total consumer financial services earned million in  an increase of million  or  over the prior year  excluding the aforementioned gains 
this increase in earnings resulted from higher loan volumes and a beneficial change in deposit mix  as low cost core deposit balances increased approximately billion  or  over the prior year 
low cost core deposits have grown as improved customer experience has resulted in higher sales and lower attrition during a period when our customers are seeking liquidity due to the unstable equity markets 
the declining interest rate environment  which drove down loan yields and put pressure on spreads in the deposit taking businesses  partially offset these improvements 

table of contents wealth management and brokerage earned million  which represented an increase of over the prior year level despite difficult market conditions 
the increase in earnings was largely the result of effective expense management and improved sales mix within the quick reilly brokerage group

all other all other includes transactions not allocated to our principal business lines  the residual impact of methodology allocations  such as the provision for credit losses  reserve for credit losses and equity  combined with funds transfer pricing offsets 
funds transfer pricing is used to assign interest income and interest expense to each line of business on a matched funding concept based on each business s net asset or liability position 
the provision for credit losses is generally allocated to business lines on an expected loss basis 
expected loss is an estimate of the average loss rate that individual credit portfolios will experience over an economic cycle  based on our historical loss experience and various market data 
this economic cycle methodology differs from the methodology used to determine our consolidated provision for credit losses for any given period  which is based on an evaluation of the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses considering the risk characteristics in the portfolio at a point in time 
the difference between the sum of the provisions for each line of business determined using the expected loss methodology and the consolidated provision is included in all other 
you can find more information about our consolidated reserve methodology in the reserve for credit losses section of this discussion and analysis and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this report 
the business activities of our treasury unit are also included in all other 
the treasury unit is responsible for the balance sheet management function  which consists of managing our wholesale funding needs  the structural non trading interest rate risk inherent in our banking franchise and our capital levels 
to manage interest rate risk  treasury utilizes the residential mortgage portfolio  along with other financial instruments such as securities and derivatives 
while the treasury unit utilizes the mortgage portfolio as an interest rate risk management tool and earning asset  other business units manage and have responsibility for credit risk management  accounting and general operations 
for the year ended december   all other incurred a net loss of million  compared to a net loss of million for the prior year 
net income for our treasury unit was million in compared to million in  with the increase resulting from net securities gains 
in  all other also included consolidated provisions for credit losses recorded in the second and fourth quarters million or million after tax  primarily to acknowledge the poor environment surrounding telecommunications and other large corporate credits  and the residual impact of the consolidated provision for credit loss methodology discussed earlier million after tax 
in the period  all other included million of after tax provision for credit losses in excess of that allocated to our various business lines and million of after tax income related to transfer pricing offsets 
in addition  all other in included an after tax loss of million from the sale of our mortgage banking business  after tax merger  restructuring and integration related costs of million  and after tax gains of million  principally related to divestitures associated with the bankboston merger 
the period also included million of after tax goodwill amortization

 which is more fully discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this report  goodwill amortization recorded in previous years was reclassified from the business units to all other for comparative purposes 
significant accounting policies fleetboston s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  including prevailing practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments  involving significant estimates and assumptions  in the application of certain of its accounting policies about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates and assumptions  which may materially affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  and changes in this information over time could materially impact amounts reported in the financial statements as a result of the use of different estimates and assumptions 
certain accounting policies  by their nature  have a greater reliance on the use of estimates and assumptions  and could produce results materially different from those originally reported 
based on the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  estimates and assumptions underlying reported amounts  the relatively more significant accounting policies followed by fleetboston have been identified by management as the determination of the reserve for credit losses  the valuation of principal investing securities  accounting for goodwill  and accounting for income taxes 
these policies require the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the following is a brief discussion of these significant accounting policies 
an understanding of the judgments  estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential in order to understand our reported financial condition and results of operations 
these accounting policies are described in more detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this report 

table of contents reserve for credit losses the reserve for credit losses represents the amount available for estimated probable credit losses existing in our lending portfolio 
the methodology used to provide the appropriate level of reserve is inherently subjective  and involves many complex estimates and assumptions 
we perform periodic  systematic reviews of our credit portfolios to identify inherent losses and assess the overall probability of collection 
these reviews include an analysis of historical default and loss experience which results in the identification and quantification of loss factors 
these loss factors are used in determining the appropriate level of reserve to cover the estimated probable losses existing in each lending category 
management judgment involving the estimates of loss factors can be impacted by many variables  such as the number of years of actual default and loss history included in the evaluation  the volatility of forecasted net credit losses  and the financial models used in the forecasting process 
the methodology used to determine the appropriate level of the reserve for credit losses and related provisions differs for commercial versus consumer loans  and involves other overall evaluations  such as a sovereign risk analysis  which is performed as part of our review of our international commercial and consumer loan portfolios  and assesses the cross border risk of credit loss 
in addition  significant estimates are involved in the determination of the appropriate level of reserve related to impaired loans  which are commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans on nonaccrual status and troubled debt restructurings 
the portion of the reserve related to impaired loans is based on discounted cash flows using the loan s effective interest rate  or the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans  or the observable market price of the impaired loan 
each of these variables involves judgment and the use of estimates 
for instance  discounted cash flows are based on estimates of the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
in addition to periodic estimation and testing of loss factors  we periodically evaluate prevailing economic  business and  in some cases  political conditions  including emerging markets risks and the impact of currency devaluation on cross border exposures  industry concentrations  changes in the size and characteristics of the portfolio  recent loss experience and other pertinent factors 
management judgment is involved at many levels of these evaluations 
an integral aspect of our risk management process is allocating the reserve for credit losses to various components of the lending portfolio based upon an analysis of risk characteristics  demonstrated losses  industry and other segmentations  and other factors  as well as providing an appropriate unallocated component 
the unallocated component represents management s view that  given the complexities of the lending portfolio and the assessment process  including the inherent imprecision in the financial models used in the loss forecasting process  there are estimable losses that have been incurred but not yet specifically identified  and as a result not fully provided for in the allocated portion of the reserve 
the unallocated component may change periodically after evaluating factors impacting assumptions utilized in the allocated reserve calculation  such as recent loss experience  industry concentrations  and the impact of current economic conditions on historical or forecasted net credit losses 
although the unallocated portion of the reserve is provided to absorb losses in excess of the amounts allocated to specific lending categories  both allocated and unallocated components are available to absorb losses in any lending category 
for more information about the methodology used in the determination of the reserve for credit losses  refer to the financial condition reserve for credit losses section of this discussion and analysis 
principal investing securities investments in private companies are generally accounted for using the cost method and are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost less declines in value deemed other than temporary 
these investments do not trade on established exchanges and  accordingly  their fair value is not readily determinable 
gains and losses related to these investments are recorded in capital markets revenue when they are sold or otherwise exchanged  or when declines in value are deemed other than temporary 
certain equity investments in private companies are accounted for using the equity method  with changes in carrying value recognized currently in capital markets revenue 
a determination to use the equity method is generally based on the level of our ownership interest and whether we have the ability to influence the operating or financial decisions of the investee 
investments in public companies are carried at fair value  based on quoted market prices  with unrealized gains and losses recorded  net of tax  as a component of stockholders equity 
when such investments are liquidated or deemed impaired  gains and losses are recorded in capital markets revenue 
investments in investment fund partnerships are accounted for under the equity method of accounting  using financial information for the partnerships provided by the respective investment fund managers  with changes in carrying value recognized currently in capital markets revenue 
significant management judgment is involved in the evaluation of declines in value of individual investments 
declines that are deemed other than temporary are recognized currently in the income statement through write downs of the investments 
the estimates and assumptions used by management to evaluate declines in value can be impacted by many factors  such as the financial condition  earnings capacity and near term prospects of the company in which we have invested and  for publicly traded securities  the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than cost 
the evaluation of these investments is also subject to the overall condition of the economy and its impact on the capital markets 
if sufficient evidence does not exist to support a realizable value equal 
table of contents to or greater than the carrying value of the investment  an impairment loss is recorded 
for more information about our principal investing portfolio  refer to the capital markets revenue section of this discussion and analysis 
goodwill goodwill  which arises from the purchase price exceeding the assigned value of net assets of acquired businesses  represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements being acquired 
the majority of our goodwill resulted from business acquisitions  and its value is inherent primarily in our banking  credit card and asset management businesses 
of the total goodwill included in our consolidated balance sheet  about is recorded in our personal financial services business line  in commercial financial services  in capital markets  and in international banking 
the value of this goodwill is supported ultimately by revenue from our banking and credit card businesses and the market value of the assets under management 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth  or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods  could lead to impairment of goodwill  which would be recorded as a writedown in our income statement 
on an annual basis  or as circumstances dictate  management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may indicate impairment in the carrying amount 
the evaluation methodology for potential impairment is inherently complex  and involves significant management judgment in the use of estimates and assumptions 
we evaluate impairment using a two step process 
first  we compare the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  no impairment exists 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  then we compare the implied fair value  defined below  of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  then goodwill impairment is recognized by writing the goodwill down to the implied fair value 
we use quoted market prices where available to value the reporting unit being evaluated for goodwill impairment 
if not available  we estimate future cash flows using present value techniques 
these estimates involve many assumptions  including expected results of the reporting unit  an assumed discount rate and an assumed growth rate for the reporting unit 
in some cases  expected results are normalized to adjust for material nonrecurring transactions if considered necessary for a more meaningful estimate 
the discount rate used is the rate used by fleetboston in evaluating external acquisitions 
the implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  as if the unit had been acquired in a busi ness combination and the fair value of the unit was the purchase price 
events that may indicate goodwill impairment include significant or adverse changes in the business  economic or political climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  and a more likely than not expectation that a business of fleetboston will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
more information about goodwill is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this report 
income taxes our overall tax position is fundamentally complex  and management judgment is involved in the analysis of income tax assets and liabilities 
an integral aspect of this analysis involves estimating the expected realization of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
management s determination of the likelihood that deferred tax assets can be realized is subjective  and involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
the realization of deferred tax assets  including foreign tax credits  arises from carrybacks to prior taxable periods  levels of future taxable income  including net foreign source income in certain periods  and the achievement of tax planning strategies 
underlying estimates and assumptions can change over time  influencing our overall tax positions  as a result of unanticipated events or circumstances  in particular the level of foreign source earnings 
management continually monitors and evaluates the worldwide impact of tax decisions  rulings and current developments on the estimates and assumptions underlying our analysis of the expected realization of deferred tax assets and valuation reserves

consolidated results of operations net interest income year ended december fte basis in millions interest income tax equivalent adjustment interest expense net interest income net interest income decreased million  or  compared to  with million of this decrease related to argentina and million related to brazil 
the decrease in argentina resulted mainly from a higher level of nonperforming assets and changes in government policies which resulted in higher funding costs 
such government policies included the government mandated rule change subjecting all deposits to inflation related indexation adjustments  which is more fully dis 
table of contents cussed in the country risk section of this discussion and analysis 
the decline in brazil was primarily due to our previously discussed risk reduction actions 
the remaining decrease in net interest income was primarily due to higher levels of nonperforming assets and narrower spreads  continued weak loan demand  our previously disclosed efforts to reduce non strategic domestic corporate exposures and the sale of our mortgage banking business in the second quarter of partially offsetting these declines was an increase in home equity loans and domestic low cost core deposits

changes in the components of interest earning assets  as well as interest bearing liabilities  are discussed in more detail below 
net interest margin for declined basis points to  compared to in  with basis points of this decrease related to latin america  primarily argentina 
excluding argentina  net interest margin was fairly flat compared to  as an increase in the level of nonperforming loans and a change in asset mix were offset by the favorable impact of growth in low cost core deposits 
net interest margin is affected by several factors  including fluctuations in the overall interest rate environment  funding strategies  and the mix of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and noninterest bearing liabilities  as well as the use of derivative instruments in managing interest rate risk 
we utilize derivative instruments which qualify for hedge accounting as an interest rate risk management tool 
these derivatives serve to stabilize net interest income and net interest margin when interest rates fluctuate 
accordingly  the impact of derivatives on net interest income and net interest margin should be viewed in the overall context of our risk management strategy 
for and  net interest margin would have been approximately and  respectively  if hedges were not entered into to mitigate interest rate fluctuations 
more information about our use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk is included in the market risk management section of this discussion and analysis  and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this report 
average securities increased billion to billion due to net purchases of domestic debt securities throughout average domestic loans and leases decreased billion to billion in  as a result of lower average commercial and industrial  or c i  loan levels resulting from weaker loan demand combined with our targeted reduction of non strategic domestic corporate exposures 
also contributing to this decline were higher charge offs and a decrease in average residential loans due to loan run off 
partially offsetting these declines were increases in average home equity loans  due to the low interest rate environment  and credit card receivables 
average international loans and leases decreased billion  primarily due to the devaluation of the argentine peso  as well as our continuing efforts to reduce risk exposures in latin america 
average other interest earning assets decreased billion to billion in  primarily due to a decrease in average federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell  partly the result of a shift in our earning asset mix resulting from an increase in home equity loans 
the billion decrease in average interest bearing deposits from was primarily the result of the pesofication and devaluation of the local currency in argentina  coupled with maturities of domestic time deposits 
these declines were partially offset by growth in average domestic low cost core deposits 
average short term borrowings decreased billion to billion in  due to lower short term borrowing needs resulting from the overall reduction in average loans and growth in domestic low cost core deposits 
average long term debt decreased billion to billion in  primarily due to net maturities of senior notes throughout  partially offset by the issuance of trust preferred securities 
provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses for amounted to billion compared to billion for the provision primarily reflected the impact of continued weakness in the us economy on domestic commercial credit  as well as economic conditions in latin america 
the provision for credit losses reflects management s assessment of the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses  considering the current risk characteristics of the lending portfolio and economic conditions 
levels of future provisions will continue to be a function of management s assessment of credit risk based upon periodic reviews of the reserve for credit losses  including assessments of the potential impact of domestic economic conditions and the difficult operating environment in latin america 

table of contents as a result of our lending to corporate borrowers  we are significantly impacted by the depressed portions of the economic cycle 
the domestic commercial credit environment remains stressed  and therefore the level of future provisions cannot be determined with certainty 
in april  we announced that we would reduce our credit exposure to targeted  non strategic areas of corporate lending by approximately billion  of which consisted of funded credits 
we completed that reduction effort during the fourth quarter of  and we anticipate further reductions in exposure in additional information about commercial credit and the reserve for credit losses can be found in the loans and leases and reserve for credit losses sections of this discussion and analysis  respectively

at december   total domestic and international assets under management were approximately billion compared to billion at december  brokerage fees and commissions brokerage fees and commissions increased million  or  compared to  due primarily to higher sales of specialty mutual fund and annuity products at quick reilly  which is transitioning into an advisory based business 
growth in these product sales helped offset lower retail brokerage fees and commissions resulting from the continued weak market conditions 
banking fees and commissions year ended december in millions cash management fees deposit account charges electronic banking fees other total banking fees and commissions banking fees and commissions declined million from  and mainly reflected declines in argentina as the currency devaluation impacted deposit account charges and other fees  as well as declines in brazil 
excluding decreases from argentina and brazil  banking fees and commissions increased million from this increase was primarily due to higher cash management fees reflecting growth in sales from cross selling  and higher electronic banking fees 
these increases were partially offset by declines related to a change in fee structure in line with our customer focused strategy 
credit card revenue credit card revenue increased million from to million in  mainly the result of higher interchange income driven by increased sales volume and a pre tax gain of million in from the sale of credit card receivables unrelated to securitization activities  compared to a pre tax gain of million in these revenues were partially offset by amortization of a higher level of deferred loan origination costs 
we service approximately billion of managed both securitized and owned domestic credit card receivables 
the primary components of credit card revenue associated with the securitized portion of the portfolio include gains on sale and servicing revenue 
the primary components of credit card revenue associated with the owned portion of the portfolio include net interest in 
table of contents come  interchange fees and complementary product revenues  offset by the provision for credit losses and amortization of deferred loan origination costs 
the securitization of credit card receivables changes our status from that of a lender to that of a loan servicer 
accordingly  there is a change in the classification of revenue associated with the securitized receivables when reported in the income statement 
we do not record net interest income or provisions for credit losses on securitized receivables  since we do not own the balances 
instead  interest and fees earned on the receivables  net of credit losses  are transferred to the securitization trust  which is responsible for the payment of funding costs 
we retain a contractual right to residual cash flows and calculate a gain on sale based on the present value of those cash flows over time 
in future periods  the excess cash flows transferred to fleetboston are recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of our retained residual interest 
for  as a result of the securitization of credit card receivables  we recorded securitization income  primarily composed of gains on sale of million and servicing income of million  in credit card revenue 
for  as a result of the securitization of credit card receivables  we recorded securitization income  primarily composed of gains on sale of million and servicing income of million  in credit card revenue 
the gains on sale were recognized on new credit card securitizations and replenishment of revolving credit card securitization pools 
future revenues from securitization activities may vary depending upon the credit performance of the receivables supporting the securitization  because credit losses are a component of the gain on sale calculation associated with those securitized receivables 
additional information concerning our credit card securitization activities is included in the liquidity risk management section of this discussion and analysis and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this report 
capital markets revenue year ended december in millions market making revenue syndication agency fees trading profits and commissions foreign exchange revenue underwriting and advisory fees securities gains losses principal investing total capital markets revenue capital markets revenue increased million in compared to this increase was driven by lower levels of investment writedowns in the principal investing portfolio and an improvement in the level of securities gains losses in these improvements were offset by a decline in foreign exchange revenue  partly due to the release of argentine deposits previously frozen by judicial decrees  as well as the absence of the previously men tioned million gain from the sale of our investment in the nyce corporation 
revenues from capital markets activities are impacted by a variety of factors  including investor sentiment  the condition of the economy  interest rates and equity markets 
market making revenue decreased million  or  to million in although transaction volume increased at fleet specialist in  average trade size and average price per share decreased as a result of market conditions  which in turn resulted in lower revenues per trade 
syndication agency fees declined million to million for  as a result of lower syndication volume during such fees are a function of the timing and level of syndication transactions  which were generally lower in due to market conditions 
trading profits and commissions declined million  or  mainly due to a charge recorded in the fourth quarter of for an enron related financing 
foreign exchange revenue decreased million  or  from  due  in part  to unfavorable argentine government related actions  as mentioned above 
net securities gains of million in resulted mainly from gains on sales of domestic debt securities  offset mostly by losses attributable to argentina  as well as losses in the brazilian securities portfolio resulting from portfolio repositioning 
the net securities loss of million included a million loss on sale of securities following the summit acquisition as well as writedowns of the argentine government bond portfolio  partially offset by gains from sales of domestic corporate bonds 
principal investing losses were lower in compared to  mainly due to lower levels of investment portfolio writedowns approximately million in compared to billion in  partially offset by the previously mentioned million gain from the sale of our investment in the nyce corporation in of the total investment writedowns recorded in  were related to investments in private companies  were related to investments in investment fund partnerships and were related to investments in public companies 
approximately of the aggregate public and private investment writedowns related to the technology and telecommunications sectors 
the carrying values of these investments are subject to the overall condition of the economy and its impact on the equity markets 
over the past two years  private equity investing has experienced significant illiquidity and impairment in value as a result of deterioration in financial markets and continued weakness in the us economy 
certain industry sectors have been particularly impacted by these conditions  including technology and telecommunications 
as a result of our investment in these industry sectors  as well as the manufacturing and distribution  retailing  and media and entertainment sectors  we expect the principal investing portfolio to continue to experience stress 
we will continue our previously disclosed efforts to reduce our overall principal investing exposure 

table of contents during  we made new investments totaling million million of new investments and million of previously committed investments  compared to million million of new investments and million of previously committed investments in as of december   we had unfunded commitments to invest in funds totaling approximately billion 
these commitments are drawn down periodically throughout the life of the respective investment fund partnership 
the principal investing portfolio had an aggregate carrying value of approximately billion at december   compared to billion at december  the following table presents an industry breakdown of our investments in public and private companies and primary investment fund partnerships  which accounted for approximately billion of the billion aggregate carrying value of the principal investing portfolio at december  the industry breakdown for the investments in investment fund partnerships is based on information for the individual investments provided by the various funds  and is one to two quarters in arrears

in addition  approximately of the portfolio has been held for three years or less  with an additional held between four and five years 
we utilize a variety of tools and processes to manage risk within our principal investing portfolio 
these tools include a stringent evaluation and approval process for individual investments  portfolio diversification guidelines  risk rating systems  and portfolio monitoring processes which include procedures for identifying troubled investments and taking appropriate action 
with respect to diversification  we have established portfolio guidelines for stage of investment seed  early or later stage  geographic concentration and industry concentration 
these guidelines are reviewed for compliance on a regular basis 
an eight level rating system is used to rate investment quality  and valuations and investment ratings are changed as company specific facts and circumstances dictate 
in addition  all investments are reviewed at least quarterly 
to further manage risk within the principal investing portfolio  we utilize derivative contracts to offset foreign currency exposure resulting from certain investments that are denominated in a foreign currency 
publicly traded investments are generally liquidated within a six month period after expiration of trading restrictions unless such action is not practical 
when publicly traded securities are received as distributions from investment fund partnerships  these securities are liquidated as soon as possible 
other noninterest income gains on branch divestitures of million were recorded in in connection with the bankboston merger 
other noninterest income of million in was million  or  higher than this increase resulted from the absence of a million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of related to the estimated impact of argentine government actions with respect to our argentine operations  partially offset by the absence of million of revenues recorded in the first half of from our mortgage banking business  which we sold in june excluding these items in  noninterest income increased million compared to noninterest expense year ended december in millions employee compensation and benefits occupancy and equipment marketing and public relations legal and other professional intangible asset amortization merger and restructuring related charges other total noninterest expense noninterest expense decreased billion  or  compared to this decrease was primarily due to a million decline in merger and restructuring costs  the absence of the million loss from the sale of our mortgage banking business  lower incentive compensation levels  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization beginning january  in connection with our adoption of the new goodwill accounting standard  and full year cost savings realized in from our corporate wide expense containment program implemented in in  we recorded million of restructuring charges  composed of severance and outplacement costs  in connection with our plan for a modest streamlining of operations 
we expect this action to result in expense reductions of approximately million in merger and restructuring related charges of million related mainly to the summit acquisition and the reorganization of capital markets and other businesses 
additional information concerning these charges is included in

 accounting for stock based compensation  for stock options granted after january  in accordance with the standard  options granted prior to january  will continue to be accounted for under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  with no compensation expense recognized 
as a result of our adoption of fair value accounting  we recorded approximately million of employee compensation and benefits expense in additional information concerning stock based compensation is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this report 
as a result of our election to account for adoption of the fair value accounting provisions of sfas no 
under the prospective method  employee compensation and benefits expense related to stock options is expected to increase from million for to approximately million for beyond  additional increases in expense  if any  cannot be reliably estimated  as they will depend on the number and type of awards granted  as well as future economic conditions related to our stock price and related volatility  our dividend yield  risk free interest rates and other factors 
given the performance of investment markets over the past few years and the related implications for long term trends  for financial accounting purposes we will reduce our assumption for expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets from  used in  to for in addition  based on market yields at december   the discount rate will be reduced from  used in  to 
we anticipate that the combined impact of these two assumption changes along with plan experience  including recent investment losses  will result in additional noninterest expense of million to million per year for the next three years 
these assumptions and projected expense levels are based on pension asset and obligation levels as of december  notwithstanding these changes  for cash funding purposes  the minimum required contribution for is expected to be zero 
additional information about our pension plan  including funded status  is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this report 
income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million for compared to million for  with respective effective tax rates of in and in the higher effective tax rate reflected the effect of nondeductible merger and restructuring related charges recorded in connection with the summit acquisition

financial condition risk management our business requires us to take risks while ensuring that we receive adequate compensation for the risks undertaken 
management of the risks inherent in our businesses is essential for financial performance and creating long term value 
risk management is governed by policies reviewed and approved annually by our board of directors  or board 
the goal of risk management is the control of our four primary risk factors credit risk  market risk  operating risk and liquidity risk to support the prudent use of capital 
these risks  if not effectively managed  can result in current losses to fleetboston as well as erosion of our capital and damage to our reputation 
we have a series of risk processes to identify the extent of risk involved in a business activity  to establish appropriate controls and to monitor compliance with our risk mitigation strategies 
risk management techniques are structured around certain fundamental risk principles  including commitment from senior level management  business unit ownership  clearly defined policies and procedures  training  independent oversight  established approval processes  management information systems  measurement and analytical tools  and capital allocation and performance evaluation processes 
these processes assist us in managing our risk exposures  but they cannot fully insulate us from losses 
despite best efforts  losses will periodically occur  particularly with respect to credit risk during any part of the credit cycle  and with respect to other risk factors  when unanticipated events challenge the limits of risk management processes 
consequently  we continue to seek improvements to our risk management process to better balance risks and returns while operating in a dynamic environment 
in response to the risks inherent in the financial services industry  we have organized our key areas of risk management into two control infrastructures 
management of credit risk  market risk from trading activities and operating risk is organized under the chief risk officer  or cro  who is a member of the office of the chief executive officer  or oceo 
the cro has administrative oversight for our global assurance functions audit  corporate compliance and risk review which monitor internal control  credit risk rating integrity and compliance with regulatory requirements and various operating risk policies 
the audit and corporate compliance functions report directly to the audit committee of the board  and risk review reports directly to the risk management committee of the board 
management of liquidity risk  market risk from non trading activities and capital is organized under our treasurer  who reports directly to the vice chairman and chief administrative officer 

table of contents we use a series of cross functional committees to provide oversight of our risk management processes 
the asset  liability  capital credit committee  or alccco  is the most senior committee  and is chaired by our treasurer  with membership including various members of the oceo and senior business and staff executives 
alccco is a strategic business and risk management forum that directs utilization of our balance sheet resources and assures consistency across tactical and technical committees 
alccco reviews and approves all major market risk  liquidity risk  and capital management programs 
in addition  alccco sets the balance sheet utilization limits for credit exposure concentration across fleetboston 
tactical and technical committees chaired by the cro or various senior executives within risk management include the credit policy committee  or cpc  the market risk committee  the loan loss reserve committee  the country exposure committee  the consumer risk committee and the operating risk committee 
there is also a joint risk management and line of business committee called the portfolio management committee  or pmc  which is co chaired by the cro and the president and chief operating officer 
the pmc is charged with implementing alccco s strategic directives relating to credit portfolio risk 
additional information on certain of our risk management processes and certain of the above mentioned committees is included in the credit risk management  country risk  liquidity risk management  market risk management and operating risk management sections of this discussion and analysis 
information concerning our management of risk inherent in our principal investing portfolio is included in the capital markets revenue section of this discussion and analysis 
credit risk management credit risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from a counterparty s failure or inability to meet payment or performance terms of a contract with fleetboston 
our credit risk management processes are intended to address the management of all forms of credit risk  including balance sheet and off balance sheet exposures 
the pmc oversees fleetboston s portfolio composition and trends  determining adjustments to optimize risk and return in accordance with strategies approved by alccco 
the cpc governs the credit risk process of fleetboston by ensuring that risk tolerances for specific lines of business and market segments are consistent with corporate strategy and capital allocations set by the pmc 
the cpc establishes house  product  industry and geographic limits and approves limit changes as required 
in addition  the cpc reviews all existing and proposed credit policies for consistency with corporate policy and appropriateness of risks taken by the lines of business 
an independent credit function monitors compliance by individual units with our credit policies  works to ensure that credit due diligence and credit administration meet acceptable standards  and is jointly responsible  along with the business units  for the effectiveness of the loan review process 
the credit function includes a staff of credit officers reporting directly to the chief credit officer  or cco 
these credit officers are assigned to work with the various business units to ensure that each individual credit exposure is appropriately risk rated  and to monitor and manage credit risks within policy and portfolio guidelines 
a risk review unit  which reports independently of both the business and credit units  assesses the integrity of risk ratings and the adequacy of the credit process for all units of fleetboston 
senior management oversees our worldwide credit activities  both corporate and consumer 
the level of management required to approve credit exposures varies according to the size and level of perceived risk 
an important aspect of our portfolio management process is the management of large  individual credits  which are governed by relationship limits that are set according to risk rating 
portfolio limits are approved by alccco  and underwriting standards are established by the cpc  for both commercial and consumer credit exposures with common risk characteristics  such as industry or product type 
the cpc establishes target risk rating profiles for fleetboston in accordance with strategies and capital allocations set by alccco and the pmc 
all limits are reviewed regularly and adjusted based on alccco s assessment of relevant conditions 
in addition  the country exposure committee  chaired by the cco  sets country limits on cross border exposures to borrowers and counterparties domiciled in other countries 
these limits  which are subject to approval of the president and chief operating officer  are more fully discussed in the country risk section of this discussion and analysis 
our credit capital management unit  which reports to the cro  plays an integral role in portfolio management by enhancing the liquidity and diversity of the loan portfolio while reducing and re balancing risk exposure 
our loan syndications unit  which is part of commercial financial services  is also important to our portfolio management process 
this unit  which is responsible for arranging participations in loans where fleetboston is the lead bank  maintains contact with other institutional lenders and investors in bank structured loans  maintains information on credit structure and pricing by risk category  evaluates the market liquidity of facilities  and syndicates fleetboston agented facilities to attain desired hold levels 
we employ a corporate wide process to review individual credits and identify emerging problems 
credits that deteriorate into certain defined risk categories are managed by a separate managed asset unit composed of professional asset recovery specialists who establish detailed asset management plans designed to mitigate our risk of loss 

table of contents consumer credit risk management uses sophisticated portfolio modeling  credit scoring and decision support tools to project credit risk and therefore to establish underwriting standards 
consumer portfolios are monitored closely to identify deviations from expected performance and shifts in consumers patterns of behavior

more information about the securitization transaction is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this report 
international commercial loans totaled billion at december  compared to billion at december   a decrease of billion  or 
this decline was primarily due to the impact of the argentine peso devaluation on the us dollar carrying value of argentine loans and a decline in brazilian commercial loans  the latter mainly the result of loan maturities that were not renewed  in connection with our brazilian exposure reduction efforts

country risk non us operations our overseas activities are subject to economic and political conditions related to  and economic and regulatory policies of  the governments of the countries in which we conduct activities 
these activities can also be impacted by perceptions in local and international financial markets of these economic and political conditions and related government policies 
in addition  local and regional economic conditions affect local economies and governments in varying degrees of severity and  accordingly  may also affect our latin american and other overseas activities 
the following tables present the total assets of  and cross border outstandings to  latin american countries in which we do business at december  and the total assets in each country include the related cross border outstandings

the remainder of this section presents updated information about our operations in argentina and brazil  including information concerning the effects of the ongoing economic  political and social situation in argentina on these operations  as well as information concerning economic and political conditions in brazil and uruguay 
in broad terms  the total assets of our overseas operations are subject to a number of risks  collectively referred to as country risk 
country risk includes the following the possibility of deteriorating economic conditions  political and social upheaval  nationalization and expropriation of assets  exchange controls restrictions on the remittance of funds transfer or cross border risk  and currency depreciation or devaluation 
we manage our overall country risk using geographic asset limits established by our country exposure committee 
within these limits  sublimits are established for the following cross border risk  nontrade related lending  transactions with long term tenors  sovereign government exposure  and assets for which a third party accepts transfer risk 
in establishing these limits  we consider the economic and political situation of individual countries using both internal and external analyses 
the country exposure committee reviews these limits at least annually 
cross border outstandings  which are included in the total assets of our overseas operations  are subject to transfer  or cross border risk in addition to credit risk 
cross border risk is the risk that customers will be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations of principal and or interest as a result of actions taken by foreign governments  such as exchange controls  debt moratoria and restrictions on the remittance of funds 
cross border outstandings include claims on third parties  as well as investments in  and funding of  our overseas operations 
total cross border outstandings to argentina and brazil  as defined  each amounted to or more of our consolidated total assets at december   and there were no total cross border outstandings to other countries which exceeded 
of consolidated total assets at december   and argentina in early  the argentine government implemented measures to convert all onshore us dollar denominated loans and deposits into pesos  and additional measures to deal with the economic crisis 
since the beginning of the argentine crisis  we have taken cumulative pre tax charges of approximately billion 
of this amount  billion of charges were recorded in during  we recorded pre tax charges of billion 
this included a pre tax unrealized loss of 
billion 
billion after tax  which was recorded  net of taxes  in the cumulative translation adjustments component of other comprehensive income 
the remaining charges in were recorded in the second quarter  and related to an increase in our argentine reserve for credit losses of 

table of contents billion and argentine government security writedowns of

at the beginning of  we had branches in argentina and  employees  compared to branches and  employees at december  in response to the argentine crisis and reduced business volume  we scaled down our argentine operations by closing branches and reducing staff levels 
argentine balance sheet we had argentine total assets of approximately billion and billion at december  and  respectively

 dec 
 in billions a consumer corporate multinationals argentine corporations middle market and financial institutions sovereign total loans a certain amounts at december  have been reclassified for comparative purposes 
the decline in argentine total assets from december  resulted from the involuntary conversion of the majority of these assets into pesos and their subsequent devaluation as the peso weakened versus the us dollar  as well as loan payments and the previously disclosed write down of argentine government securities 
the peso has devalued by approximately from december  the decline in loans from billion at december  to billion at december   was mainly attributable to the peso devaluation and loan payments 
during the second quarter of  we placed substantially all sovereign related loans and securities and a significant portion of private sector loans on nonaccrual status 
we believe that it was prudent to take this action in light of the deteriorating situation in argentina  even though many of the relationships were current in their payments at that time 
at december   total nonperforming assets  or npas  in argentina were billion  of which billion were loans and 
billion were sovereign securities 
of the billion of loans  approximately million were less than days past due at december  included in our consolidated reserve for credit losses at december  was million related to argentina 
net charge offs for were million  and we expect that net charge offs in will be higher than in in addition  since the second quarter of  the interagency country exposure review committee  or icerc  of us banking regulators has required the banking industry to maintain an allocated transfer risk reserve  or atrr  to cover certain argentine cross border exposure 
our atrr requirement was million at december   and was covered by the aforementioned million reserve for credit losses 
we have million on deposit with the argentine central bank to meet statutory reserve requirements related to our argentine operation s billion of local deposits 
we are required by local regulations to place the required reserves with the central bank based on a fixed percentage of each deposit received 
the local deposits  and intercompany borrowings  primarily fund the balance sheet of our argentine operation 
in december  the argentine government issued an order imposing limitations on the ability of bank customers in argentina to withdraw funds from their accounts in argentine banks the corralito 
since the corralito was issued  a large number of customers of our argentine operation  or bankboston argentina  have filed complaints in the argentine courts against bankboston argentina seeking to invalidate the corralito on constitutional grounds and withdraw their funds 
as a result of these claims  we recorded foreign exchange losses of million during these losses represented the impact of the judicially mandated payments to depositors at the current exchange rate versus the exchange rate originally used to convert us deposits into pesos as part of the argentine government s economic measures instituted in early to deal with that country s economic crisis 
we cannot determine the total number of claims pending in the judicial system at this time  which may result in additional losses 
foreign exchange losses related to these deposits were partially offset by foreign exchange gains on our long us dollar currency position and forward and spot trading transactions 
total net foreign exchange losses from argentina  including losses related to the deposits as described above  were million for separately  in november  customers of bankboston argentina commenced legal action in the united states  seeking to collect from fleet national bank in the united states the deposits frozen at bankboston argentina 
this lawsuit was dismissed in february more information about this legal action is included under item  legal proceedings  in part i of this report 
in november  a judge in argentina issued criminal indictments against the president of the bankboston argentina branch in buenos aires  argentina  and seventeen other senior employees of the branch  alleging fraudulent administration of business 
these indictments resulted from the purported failure of the branch to 
table of contents honor time deposits and other payment instruments presented at various offices of the branch after november   the date on which deposits were frozen by actions of the argentine government 
in not honoring the presentations  the branch and its employees were following argentine law and central bank regulations 
the branch has appealed these indictments on a number of legal bases available under argentine law 
management believes that the indictments are without merit and the branch will vigorously pursue the appeal 
also during the second quarter of  the argentine government reversed a measure that had allowed banks to charge customers an inflation adjustment on consumer loans 
however  deposit liabilities have continued to accrue the inflation adjustment 
this situation has created a mismatch between inflation adjusted assets and liabilities 
this measure resulted in a reduction of net interest income of approximately million in these situations  as well as other argentine government economic measures  may continue to significantly impact interest rate and liquidity risk related to the balance sheet of our argentine operation 
to date  we have not experienced significant liquidity issues  but we continue to closely monitor the impact of these measures  including the corralito related claims  on our liquidity position 
the future rate of inflation may increase the negative impact from the mismatch between inflation adjusted assets and liabilities

the billion of cross border outstandings at december  have the following cross border risk mitigation million were covered by insurance  which included million of investment in and funding of local operation and million of third party loans 
the insurance coverage is purchased from us and foreign government  multilateral and private insurers 
this coverage protects us from situations where repayment of the investment in and funding of local operation and third party loans is not permitted due to the inability to transfer funds or convert the necessary funds into the obligation currency due to government actions 
with respect to the coverage of million of third party loans  we are required to provide evidence that the customer s nonpayment is not credit related 
if the customer s nonpayment is due to a credit issue  we are unable to file a claim under the policy 
in all cases  we are required to follow specific procedures to ensure coverage if a cross border event occurs  including timely notification of such an event to the insurer 
of the million of trade related outstandings  million were short term  and million were guaranteed and are included in the million of guarantees presented in the preceding cross border outstandings table that cover credit and cross border risk 
the guarantees include a combination of cash and securities used as collateral and placed offshore  guarantees from non argentine domiciled companies and other third party guarantees 
the cross border risk related to these claims represents the country of the guarantor or the country in which the cash collateral is held 
due to the current argentine economic and political conditions  it is not possible to predict the impact that future developments may have on this cross border risk mitigation  including our ability to file a claim under the 
table of contents insurance policies or to be reimbursed under the guarantee if such a situation arises 
the following table presents changes in aggregate cross border outstandings to argentina from december  to december  in billions argentina aggregate outstandings at january  net change in short term trade related outstandings reduction in nontrade related loans and leases net reduction in other assets aggregate outstandings at december  the argentine government enacted exchange controls in december that limited the transfer of funds outside of that country 
these regulations continue to be modified 
as of december   our cross border outstandings continued to be impacted by these regulations  and this has resulted in delays in the transfer of us dollars outside of argentina 
we are unable to determine at the present time the ultimate impact those measures will have on our cross border outstandings 
argentine mutual funds our argentine operation managed approximately million of mutual funds at december  certain of the argentine government s economic measures  which restricted withdrawals of bank deposits  also applied to mutual fund investments 
therefore  mutual fund investors could not receive redemptions of their funds  and this has resulted in litigation  which we discussed earlier in the argentine balance sheet section as the corralito related litigation 
argentine currency position currency positions expose us to gains or losses that depend on the relationship between currency price movements and interest rate differentials 
the following table presents our argentine long us dollar currency position  for which related foreign exchange gains or losses are recorded in our income statement 
the increase in the long position in us dollars is mainly due to the us dollar denominated compensation bond  the majority of which was received in the continued evolution of the argentine government s economic measures may impact the size and direction of our currency position in future periods 
at year end daily average in millions argentina a b a positive values reflect us dollar assets funded by local currency liabilities ie  a long position in ie dollars 
b negative values reflect local currency assets funded by us dollars ie  a short position in ie dollars 
in addition to the currency exposure discussed above  our investment in and funding of local operations creates translation exposure  which arises from changes in the local currency exchange rate versus the us dollar 
as a result of the change in argentina s financial system from us dollars to pesos  we changed the functional currency of the argentine unit from the us dollar to the peso  in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translation  at the beginning of translation gains and losses that result from this exposure  along with any offsetting hedge gains or losses related to covering this exposure  are recorded directly to other comprehensive income  net of tax  as discussed earlier in this section 
the government measures created a situation where our translation exposure could not be fully hedged against currency rate changes  and at december   our translation exposure was approximately 
billion  which is included in our investment in and funding of local operation presented in the table of cross border outstandings on the previous page 
the cumulative impact recorded in other comprehensive income since implementing this accounting change  and the impact of foreign exchange forward contracts hedging translation exposure on a portion of the investment in and funding of local operation  was a million pre tax unrealized loss  or million after tax 
recent events as previously mentioned  the argentine government implemented measures in early to convert all onshore us dollar denominated loans and deposits into pesos 
the argentine government is now considering the implementation of measures to convert these deposits back into us dollars 
to date  however  the courts in argentina have not ruled on such a change 
until such action is completed and the argentine government decrees how such a change will be implemented  we cannot determine the ultimate impact such a measure may have on our deposits and results of operations in argentina 
the argentine government continues to implement measures to manage the economic crisis and to reach a long term agreement with the international monetary fund  or imf  on a refinancing package 
in january  the imf agreed to a short term rollover of the maturities of billion of debt owed to the imf and multilateral lending organizations until august  also in january  the argentine government made past due payments to the imf and other multilateral lending organizations 
negotiations continue on a long term financing package with the imf 
during the fourth quarter of  the argentine peso strengthened versus the us dollar by approximately from september  during the same period  the monthly rate of inflation declined to a modest level 
the argentine government s economic policy and the low level of economic activity have led to a lack of demand for us dollars 
recently  the argentine government relaxed some restrictions on the remittance of us dollars outside of argentina 
we will continue to monitor the impact of the exchange rate and inflation on our currency position and argentine operations 
during the first quarter of  a number of banks announced to depositors an offering to repay  in advance  
table of contents certain deposits that were subject to the corralito 
our argentine operation made this offer to all holders of certificates of rescheduled deposits 
we have approximately million to million of certificates of rescheduled deposits 
we estimate that approximately million to million of certificates of rescheduled deposits will be prepaid under the offering 
we do not expect this program to have a material adverse impact on our liquidity position 
the presidential election is currently scheduled for april the outcome of this election may result in a change to the argentine government s economic policies  which may impact the country s financial situation 
we continue to monitor and evaluate the argentine economic situation and related economic measures discussed above  and will adjust our strategy as deemed appropriate 
however  in light of the changing economic measures and continuing economic  political  including the outcome of the presidential elections  and social uncertainty in the country  it is not possible to predict the impact that future developments may have on our operations in argentina or the necessity to take future charges 
brazil we operate branches in brazil and had total assets of approximately billion and billion at december  and  respectively

the table below presents the components of loans 
dec 
 dec 
 in billions consumer corporate multinationals brazilian corporations middle market and financial institutions total loans the decline in total assets mainly reflects our previously discussed intent to reduce risk exposure in brazil by decreasing lending activities and repositioning the securities portfolio toward shorter maturities  as well as the impact of the devaluation of the brazilian currency  or real  against the us dollar from december  
the decline in the loan portfolio was primarily due to not renewing loans that matured and the impact of real devaluation 
npas in the brazilian portfolio were million at december  compared to million at december  the increase was primarily related to one telecommunications borrower 
net charge offs for were million 
we expect npas and net charge offs to increase in our consolidated reserve for credit losses at december  included approximately million related to brazil 
as part of our brazilian operation s balance sheet management  we held approximately billion of treasury assets securities available for sale  resale agreements and other monetary assets in the preceding balance sheet table at december   compared to billion at december  of this total  securities available for sale were composed mainly of brazilian government bonds  which were million at december  compared to billion at december  the decline was due to securities sales in the first quarter of and maturities 
in the second quarter of  we recorded a pre tax security loss of million to swap existing brazilian government securities for government securities with shorter maturities 
at december   these government securities had an average duration of approximately years compared to years at december  we also had billion of resale agreements with banks in brazil  which were collateralized by brazilian government bonds 
our brazilian balance sheet is partially funded by intercompany funding  local liabilities and third party liabilities where the provider assumes the transfer risk  which is discussed below

f certain december  and amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes 
total cross border outstandings decreased from december   mainly due to reductions in loans and available for sale securities 
the decrease in total cross border outstandings was mostly offset by the decline in third party funding and other trade related transfer risk mitigation due to maturities which were not renewed 
the following table presents the components of our total cross border outstandings  net of cross border risk mitigation

billion of cumulative pre tax unrealized mark to market losses recorded in other comprehensive income as of december  our brazilian operation actively uses various products to mitigate the cross border risk related to its third party claims and intercompany funding 
cross border risk mitigation related to the billion of cross border outstandings at december  amounted to billion and is summarized below 
billion was covered by insurance contracts see discussion on page for more information concerning these programs  billion was related to transfer risk mitigation  all of which is trade related and included in the billion of trade related claims in the preceding cross border outstandings table 
the cross border risk mitigation is designed so that payment of these claims and intercompany funding is made outside of brazil by third parties in the event of a cross border risk event 
the repayment is tied to trade transactions authorized and approved by the brazilian central bank 
in order to maintain our cross border risk protection  it is necessary that the brazilian export markets remain open  
billion of assets funded by third party liabilities where the provider assumes the transfer risk  these funds are typically raised from correspondent banks 
of the 
billion  million are trade related 
in these cases  the provider of funds assumes the risk of nonpayment if  at the time a payment is due on the funding  a cross border risk event occurs due to government action 
the provider of funds is contractually bound to either accept local currency in repayment or wait until the event ceases to exist to receive payment  and billion represents loans with guarantees that cover credit and cross border risk  of which million are trade related 
the guarantees include a combination of guarantees from non brazilian domiciled companies  funded participations and other third party guarantees 
the cross border risk related to these claims represents the country of the guarantor or the country in which the cash collateral is held 
the third party funding and guarantees require us to perform certain actions to ensure our coverage under the various cross border risk mitigation products 
in summary  our brazilian trade related exposure as of december   and was as follows december in billions assets with transfer risk mitigation insurance contracts other trade related transfer risk mitigation third party funding guaranteed assets with no transfer risk mitigation short term trade trade related claims refer to brazil cross border outstandings table mutual funds we acted as manager for approximately billion of mutual funds in brazil at december   which were invested primarily in brazilian government securities 

table of contents brazilian currency position periodically  we establish currency positions in certain countries with the intention of taking advantage of expected movements in currency exchange rates 
currency positions expose us to gains or losses that depend on the relationship between currency price movements and interest rate differentials 
the following table presents our brazilian currency position 
at year end daily average in millions brazil a b a positive values reflect us dollar assets funded by local currency liabilities ie  a long position in ie dollars 
b negative values reflect local currency assets funded by us dollars ie  a short position in ie dollars 
although the brazilian real has devalued significantly versus the us dollar during  our results of operations were not significantly impacted due to the modest positions held during this time 
the events in a country may have varying impacts on the different classes of assets based on the nature of the country risk event 
after a long and substantial devaluation  the brazilian real recovered in the fourth quarter of  reflecting growing comfort from the financial community both inside and outside of brazil with the new presidential administration 
the local currency as well as local inflation  however  are currently under pressure due to the uncertainties stemming from various geopolitical issues including the iraq situation and the recent significant increase in oil prices 
this has led the central bank to tighten the monetary policy and to raise the overnight benchmark interest to 
despite the tightening of monetary policy and the uncertain global environment  domestic activity posted a positive performance 
exports  import substitution and the agricultural related businesses were the driving forces behind this performance 
the trade balance surplus reached billion in  a annual increase from as a result  the current account deficit also declined significantly to billion in from billion in it mitigated the substantial decline in the foreign capital inflow seen in  resulting either from local presidential election or external factors 
the public sector primary surplus  defined as the difference between public sector spending  excluding interest payments on the public debt  and receipts  exceeded for the fourth consecutive year the targets agreed to with the imf  largely compensating for the negative effects of the devaluation on the public debt as about of the total public sector debt is indexed to the change in the exchange rate 
we will continue to monitor the political situation in brazil to assess what impact any new brazilian government measures may have on our operations 
as discussed above  we consider the country risks when we establish internal risk limits 
to date  our brazilian operations have not been significantly impacted by the deterioration in economic conditions in brazil  although the increased risk has caused us to reduce our exposure to brazil and increase the portion of our reserve for credit losses allocated to brazil 
we continue to closely monitor the situation in brazil and the potential impact it could have on our brazilian operations 
uruguay the situations in argentina and brazil have also impacted the uruguayan economy 
our uruguayan assets and deposits declined by million and million  respectively  since december  to million and million  respectively  at december  total loans at december  were million and we have approximately million of sovereign securities  of which approximately are used to meet statutory reserve requirements related to our local deposits 
npas in the uruguayan portfolio were million and net charge offs for were million 
we expect npas and net charge offs to increase in the reduction in deposits has been replaced  in part  by an increase in intercompany borrowings 
in the event that there is a further reduction in deposits  there may be additional intercompany borrowings which could result in an increase in cross border outstandings 
the imf and other multilateral lending organizations agreed in august to advance funding of billion from their financial support package 
negotiations with the imf on scheduled disbursements continue 
during the fourth quarter of  the uruguayan government passed legislation to strengthen its supervision of the financial banking system 
since the implementation of the new measures by the uruguayan government during the fourth quarter of and the imf agreement  our deposit levels have been stable 
in the first quarter of  uruguay s credit rating was reduced by an international rating agency based on concerns that the country may default on some of its obligations 
it is not possible to predict what additional effect  if any  the new economic measures  the rating agency action  or future developments in argentina and brazil will ultimately have on uruguay or on our uruguayan operation 
we will continue to closely monitor developments in uruguay and the other latin american countries in which we operate and their potential impact on our latin american operations 
nonperforming assets npas include loans  lease financing receivables and debt securities for which income recognition has ceased or is limited  as well as foreclosed assets 
npas also include impaired loans  which are commercial and commercial real estate loans on nonaccrual status as well as troubled debt restructurings 
loans which have undergone a troubled debt restructuring are returned to accrual status after a seasoning period if the restructured loan bears a market rate of interest and full collectibility is not in doubt 
such troubled debt restructurings  although no longer considered to be npas  continue to be reported as impaired

we have experienced deterioration in credit quality in a number of industry sectors in our domestic c i portfolio 
we have a continuous review process to identify potential problem areas of the portfolio  which currently include the aviation  telecommunications  and merchant energy sectors  as well as certain regional energy distribution sectors 
we will continue to monitor and evaluate these potential risks 
future levels of npas will be influenced by economic conditions  including the impact of those conditions on our customers  interest rates and other internal and external factors existing at the time 
we currently expect npas to decrease as we progress through additional information on argentine npas is included in the country risk section of this discussion and analysis 
reserve for credit losses the reserve for credit losses represents the amount available for estimated probable credit losses which management determines exist in our lending portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
loans are charged off when they are deemed uncollectible  after giving consideration to factors such as the customer s financial condition  underlying collateral and guarantees  as well as general and specific industry economic conditions 
we perform periodic  systematic reviews of our portfolios to identify inherent losses and assess the overall 
table of contents probability of collection 
these reviews include an analysis of historical default and loss experience which results in the identification and quantification of loss factors 
these loss factors are used in determining the appropriate level of the reserve for credit losses 
in addition  we periodically evaluate prevailing economic and business conditions  industry concentrations  including emerging markets risks and cross border outstandings  changes in the size and characteristics of the portfolio  recent loss experience and other pertinent factors 
portions of the reserve for credit losses are provided to cover the probable losses inherent in each lending category based on the results of this detailed review process 
the results of these ongoing analyses are reviewed and discussed by our loan loss reserve committee  the respective lines of business and the collections group 
commercial loans and leases and related unfunded commitments to extend credit are individually reviewed and assigned a credit risk rating from low risk of loss to high risk of loss 
loans with a credit risk rating of and above and a principal balance greater than  are subject to further individual review to determine the need for a specific loan loss allocation 
additionally  derived or calculated loan loss allocations are provided for loans not specifically reviewed 
for loans with a credit risk rating of to  loss factors are assigned using actual default and loss history based on their specific credit risk rating classification 
the combination of these analyses is the basis for determining the commercial loan and lease portion of the reserve for credit losses 
consumer loans  which include credit card receivables  residential mortgages  home equity loans lines  direct indirect loans  consumer finance and international consumer loans  are generally evaluated for credit risk as a group based on product type 
the determination of the consumer loan portion of the reserve for credit losses is primarily based on one year of forecasted net credit losses 
this forecast is determined using several modeling tools  including a delinquency roll rate model  a vintage model and a regression model 
credit risk for small business loans is analyzed in a similar manner  but a risk rating migration analysis  rather than delinquency and one year of forecasted net losses  serves as the basis for the reserve 
a sovereign risk analysis  which assesses the cross border risk of credit loss  is performed as part of our re view of our international commercial and consumer loan portfolios 
testing of forecasted net credit losses and specific allocations of the reserve is performed quarterly 
as a result  adjustments to reserve allocations for specific segments of the lending portfolio may be made  depending on the accuracy of forecasted net credit losses and other credit or policy related issues 
the process we use to determine the appropriate level of the overall reserve for credit losses is based on this analysis  augmented by management s judgment as to the uncertainties involved 
this reserving methodology is reviewed on a periodic basis and modified as appropriate 
based on this analysis  including the aforementioned assumptions  management believes that the reserve for credit losses is adequate as of december  an integral component of our risk management process is allocating the reserve for credit losses to components of the lending portfolio based upon an analysis of risk characteristics  demonstrated losses  loan segmentations and other factors 
the unallocated component of the reserve for credit losses represents management s view that  given the complexities of the lending portfolio  there are estimable probable losses that have been incurred within the lending portfolio but not yet specifically identified and  as a result  are not fully captured in the allocated portions of the reserve 
this unallocated reserve may change periodically after evaluating factors impacting assumptions utilized in the allocated reserve calculations  such as industry concentrations  recent loss experience and the impact of current economic conditions on historical or forecasted net credit losses 
although the unallocated portion of the reserve is provided to absorb losses in excess of the amounts allocated to specific lending categories  both allocated and unallocated components are available to absorb losses in any lending category 
at december   the allocated reserve for credit losses amounted to of the total reserve for credit losses  compared to at december  for more information about the estimates and assumptions used in the determination of the reserve for credit losses  refer to the significant accounting policies section of this discussion and analysis

our reserve for credit losses increased million from december  to billion at december  the ratio of the consolidated reserve for credit losses to period end loans and leases was at december   compared to at december  the increase in the level of the reserve for credit losses was primarily the result of provisions related to domestic commercial credit and the economic conditions in latin america 
while we remain concerned with continued weakness in the us economy  continuing economic instability in argentina  and other uncertainties  we anticipate a lower level of credit costs in compared to due to the current level of the reserve for credit losses and management s efforts to reduce risk exposures

liquidity risk management general liquidity risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from our inability to meet known near term and projected long term funding commitments 
a related liquidity risk is not having sufficient funds to meet financial commitments under sudden and unexpected adverse conditions 
the objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure our ability to meet our financial obligations 
these obligations are the payment of deposits on demand or at their contractual maturity  the repayment of borrowings as they mature  the payment of lease obligations as they become due  the ability to fund new and existing loan and other funding commitments  and the ability to take advantage of new business opportunities 
alccco is responsible for implementing the policies and guidelines of the board governing liquidity 
us dollar liquidity management is centralized in our treasury unit in boston  with overseas operations managing their own local currency liquidity requirements 
liquidity is achieved by the maintenance of a strong base of core customer funds  maturing short term assets  the ability to sell marketable securities  and access to 
table of contents capital markets 
liquidity may also be enhanced through the securitization of commercial and consumer receivables 
liquidity is measured and monitored daily  allowing management to better understand and react to balance sheet trends 
on a monthly basis  a comprehensive liquidity analysis is reviewed by alccco 
the analysis provides a summary of the current liquidity measurements  projections and future liquidity positions given various levels of liquidity stress 
management also maintains a detailed liquidity contingency plan designed to respond to an overall decline in the condition of the banking industry or a problem specific to fleetboston 
parent company and bank liquidity are managed separately 
the primary sources of liquidity for the parent company are interest and dividends from subsidiaries  access to the money and debt capital markets and short term liquid assets 
dividends from banking subsidiaries are limited by various regulatory requirements related to capital adequacy and retained earnings 
more information about these restrictions is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this report 
the primary sources of liquidity for our banking subsidiaries are cash flows from operations  core deposits  borrowings and short term high quality liquid assets 
liquidity at the bank level is managed through the monitoring of anticipated changes in loans  core deposits and wholesale funds 
diversification of liquidity sources by maturity  market  product and funds provider are mandated through alccco guidelines 
the strength of the banking subsidiaries liquidity position is their base of core customer deposits 
these core deposits are supplemented by wholesale funding sources in the capital markets  as well as from direct customer contacts 
wholesale funding sources include large certificates of deposit  foreign branch deposits  federal funds  collateralized borrowings and a billion domestic bank note program 
non banking subsidiaries rely primarily on cash flows from operations  short term liquid assets and funds from the parent company 
at december   the parent company had commercial paper outstanding of million  compared with million at december  the parent company had short term liquid assets of billion at december  and billion at december  short term liquid assets include deposits placed by the parent company with its banking subsidiaries 
it is the parent company s policy to maintain short term assets at an amount sufficient to meet payment of its short and long term debt maturities and net cash operating shortfall over a month period 
the parent company had billion available for the issuance of common stock  preferred stock or trust preferred securities  senior or subordinated securities and other debt securities at december  under an effective shelf registration statement filed with the sec 
availability under this shelf registration was billion at february  fleetboston s ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by strong debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies 
factors essential to retaining high credit ratings include strong capital ratios and credit quality  diverse and stable core earnings  diverse liquidity sources and strong liquidity monitoring procedures 
a downgrade or loss in credit ratings could have an impact on our ability to access wholesale funding at favorable interest rates

while s p placed us on creditwatch with negative implications in january  they removed us from creditwatch after meeting with management in february to review their concerns  and affirmed their current ratings with a negative outlook 
we do not anticipate that these actions will have a material impact on our financial performance 
funding sources we have established a number of statutory business trusts  the sole purpose of which is to issue trust preferred securities and invest the proceeds in junior subordinated debentures issued by the parent company 
the parent company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed each trust s obligations under the trust securities 
the trusts are included in our consolidated financial statements  and the trust securities are included in long term debt in the consolidated balance sheet 
additional information concerning these trust preferred securities is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this report 
another important source of funding is the securitization market 
during  approximately billion of commercial loans and billion of credit card receivables were securitized 
in  approximately million of home equity loans and billion of credit card receivables were securitized 
generally  in a securitization  we transfer financial assets  such as commercial loans  credit card receivables or home equity loans  to qualifying special purpose entities  or qspes  which 
table of contents are legally isolated from fleetboston 
the qspes  in turn  sell securities to investors  which entitle them to receive specified cash flows during the term of the security 
the proceeds from the sale of securities are then distributed by the qspes to fleetboston as consideration for the loans transferred 
at december   the qspes held aggregate assets of approximately billion  composed of approximately billion of credit card receivables  billion of commercial loans and million of home equity loans  and the aggregate outstanding debt securities issued by the qspes were billion 
our retained interests in the qspes which are not subordinated to the claims of investors are included in loans in our consolidated balance sheet 
at december   the qspes held aggregate assets of billion and had aggregate outstanding debt securities totaling billion 
we hold subordinated interests in the net assets of the qspes  which provide credit enhancement to the investors in the outstanding debt securities 
at december  and  these subordinated interests included residual positions such as interest only strips and certain subordinated principal balances of million and million  respectively  accrued interest and fees receivable of million and million  respectively  and other interests  including subordinated debt securities  overcollateralization positions and cash collateral accounts of million and million  respectively 
the subordinated interests  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets  represent our maximum exposure related to the debt securities issued by the qspes 
investors in the securities have no further recourse against us if cash flows generated by the securitized assets are inadequate to service the obligations of the qspes 
we also securitize certain lease financing receivables  which totaled approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  through third party conduits 
the lease financing receivables are first sold to a bankruptcy remote subsidiary of fleetboston  which then sells an interest in the receivables to third party conduits 
the conduits  in turn  sell commercial paper to investors to fund the purchase of the receivables from fleetboston 
at fleetboston s option  cash proceeds received from lessees can be reinvested by the conduits in additional lease receivables originated by fleetboston 
we hold retained subordinated interests in the lease receivables  primarily in the form of overcollateralization positions  which provide credit enhancement to the third party conduits 
these retained interests  which totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  are included in our consolidated balance sheet and represent our maximum risk exposure associated with the securitized lease receivables 
the assets sold to the conduits are not included in our consolidated balance sheet 
additional information concerning securitizations is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this report

these commitments usually are for specific periods or contain termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee 
the total amounts of unused commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements  in that commitments often expire without being drawn upon 
letters of credit and financial guarantees are agreements whereby we guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
collateral may be required to support letters of credit in accordance with management s evaluation of the creditworthiness of each customer 
the credit exposure assumed in issuing letters of credit is essentially equal to that assumed in other lending activities 
management does not anticipate any significant losses as a result of these transactions 
other commercial commitments represent unfunded commitments of our principal investing business 
such commitments relate to investment fund partnerships and are drawn down periodically throughout the life of the fund 
we may also have liabilities under certain contractual agreements contingent upon the occurrence of certain events 
information concerning significant contractual arrangements under which fleetboston may be held contingently liable  including guarantee arrangements  as well as additional information about the commercial commitments disclosed in this section  is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this report 
off balance sheet arrangements we are also exposed to liquidity risk as a provider of financial services to our corporate customers by our corporate banking business unit 
we provide access to liquidity for such customers through asset backed commercial paper programs 
these programs utilize special purpose entities which  at the request  or on behalf  of customers  may purchase financial assets directly from those customers or from third parties  or make loans or invest in debt securities secured by the financial assets of customers 
the special purpose entities  or conduits  finance this activity through the issuance of rated commercial paper to third party investors 
we do not sell our own assets to these conduits  and the assets and obligations of the conduits are not included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we receive fees for structuring financial transactions for our customers  and for the provision of administrative services  backup liquidity lines and direct credit support to the conduits 
in and  these fees totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
at both december  and  these conduits had aggregate assets of approximately billion  primarily loans and debt securities  and aggregate liabilities outstanding  primarily commercial paper  of billion 
the assets of the conduits are generally of investment grade quality and are typically secured by other financial assets  such as leases  trade receivables  or cash held as collateral 
based on commitments of the conduits to their customers at december   the conduits could be required to provide additional funding totaling billion 
the commercial paper outstandings and commitments of the conduits to provide additional funding are supported by backup liquidity lines of credit provided by fleetboston and third parties 
we have provided backup liquidity lines totaling billion at december  no amounts were outstanding under these liquidity lines at december  we also provide direct credit support to the conduits in the form of credit derivative contracts  which had a notional amount of billion at december   or financial standby letters of credit  which totaled approximately million at december  to mitigate risk  we have entered into offsetting credit derivative contracts with third parties  and held cash collateral totaling million at december  the backup liquidity lines and financial standby letters of credit are included in the preceding commercial commitments table 
more information about our use of credit derivative contracts is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this report 
the overall potential impact of the risk to liquidity of these commercial paper programs is included in the monthly liquidity analysis more fully discussed earlier in this section 

table of contents we also provide asset management and related services to other special purpose vehicles unrelated to the conduits utilized by the commercial paper programs 
these vehicles invest in financial assets such as loans and bonds on behalf of third parties 
assets under management totaled approximately billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
we generally do not sell our own assets to these asset management vehicles  nor do we guarantee the obligations or otherwise provide credit enhancements to them 
at december  and  fleetboston held equity investments in these vehicles of approximately million and million  respectively 
fleetboston provides backup liquidity lines  which totaled million at december   to two of these vehicles 
at december   no amounts were outstanding under these liquidity lines 
fleetboston has no other exposure to loss associated with these asset management vehicles  and their assets and liabilities are not included in our consolidated balance sheet 
in and  we received aggregate management fees from these asset management vehicles totaling approximately million and million  respectively 
summary material risks to the sources of short term liquidity would include  among other things  rating agency downgrades of our deposits and debt securities below investment grade  and unanticipated funding requirements  such as guarantees of third party debt 
as of december   there were no circumstances that management considered reasonably likely to occur that would affect our sources of short term liquidity 
based upon our level of short and long term liquid assets and our ability to access the capital markets for additional funding when necessary  including our ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current shelf registration  management considers overall liquidity at december  sufficient to meet fleetboston s current obligations to customers and debt holders  support expectations for future changes in asset and liability levels and carry on normal operations 
market risk management market risk is defined as the sensitivity of income and capital to variations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  commodity prices and other market driven rates or prices 
we are exposed to market risk both in our trading activities and in our non trading  or balance sheet management  activities 
the market risk management processes for these activities apply to both balance sheet and off balance sheet exposures 
additional information concerning our management of the equity price risk associated with our principal investing portfolio is included in the capital markets revenue section of this discussion and analysis 
trading activities the financial information included in this trading activities section includes discontinued operations  unless otherwise noted 
our market risk management process for our trading activities applies to all forms of price risk  or the risk of loss in earnings arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instrument trading portfolios 
the board approves policies concerning our tolerance for these risks  and alccco issues overall strategic direction to specify the extent to which we can utilize any of the board approved limits 
the market risk committee  or mrc  chaired by the executive director  market risk management  allocates the overall risk limits for trading portfolios to individual lines of business 
senior management from these lines of business evaluates risk taking activities  and ensures that actual exposures remain consistent with approved policies and limits 
market risk management provides an independent view of the identification  measurement  monitoring and control of price risk in trading activities 
market risk management has a group of risk managers that develop specialized expertise and in depth knowledge of our trading lines of business  and work with business managers to set policies that reflect an appropriate framework for risk measurement  risk monitoring and reporting processes  and risk control structures 
these risk managers ensure compliance with established policies and risk limit structures on a daily basis  and evaluate relevant market conditions and business initiatives as part of the monitoring process 
as warranted  the risk managers review and assess proposals to alter the existing risk profile through both new products and services or significant modifications to existing products and services  thereby ensuring that the appropriate risk management oversight and infrastructure exists prior to commencement of the activity 
in addition  market risk management contains a capital markets analytics group that develops market risk measurement methodologies and models  estimates risk factors and analyzes dynamic market data for use within these models  and conducts all model validations that include ascertaining model appropriateness and testing actual model performance 
both of market risk management s above described groups rely on a separate risk information department that provides reports on trading exposures on a corporate wide basis 
our exposure to price risk arises in the normal course of our business as a financial intermediary 
we enter into interest rate  currency exchange  equity and precious metals contracts primarily to satisfy the investment and risk management needs of our customers 
in addition  we take certain proprietary trading positions  including positions in investment grade and high yield fixed income securities  local currency debt and equity securities  and related derivative instruments 
we expect these positions to benefit from short term move 
table of contents ments in the prices of securities and from perceived inefficiencies among the prices of various securities issued by the same country or entity 
domestic fixed income trading activities also include position taking in us treasury and us government agency securities 
we evaluate the overall profitability of our trading positions by measuring trading related revenues  which include the daily change in the mark to market value of these portfolios  net interest income and other related revenues 
the following histogram presents the distribution of aggregate daily trading related revenues  in millions of dollars  that resulted from our combined trading activities during trading related revenues include trading profits and commissions  foreign exchange revenue and market making revenue  which are all components of capital markets revenue  as well as net interest income from these trading positions 
bar chart presented a unique set of challenges that stemmed from our organizational re alignments as well as from market conditions in that continued into as a year of challenges and transitions  included latin american political turmoil  a re emphasis of our corporate strategy  and us economic concerns 
these considerations had a direct and immediate impact on our risk profile and our risk management processes 
with our decisions to exit certain markets in order to re deploy capital to our core businesses and reduce earnings volatility  we scaled back outstanding positions and curtailed further risk taking during the latter part of the year 
as would be expected  a difficult market environment and a lower tolerance for risk taking clearly impacted our revenue performance 
nevertheless  as shown in the chart above  our risk management discipline effectively controlled the size and extent of negative trading results 
to measure the overall price risk inherent in our trading activities  we use a value at risk  or var  methodology  based on industry standard risk measurement techniques 
we draw on historical and current market data to estimate potential market volatility  and measure the risk to earnings at a confidence level  which means that we expect daily results to exceed the potential loss as calculated by var only occasionally ie  no more than one time for at least trading days 
our var methodology includes holding periods for each position based upon an assessment of relative trading market liquidity for each instrument  and a conservative view of cross product correlations that does not reflect the full diversification benefits of positions taken across different trading businesses 
in light of the challenging set of trading conditions during  we actively enhanced our processes for price risk measurement and monitoring against approved limits 
these enhancements included more frequent reviews of holding period assumptions and risk limits  as well as refinements of our exposure measurement techniques to assess complex financial instruments 
the table below presents the exposure of our combined trading portfolios 
value at risk var in millions average high low year ended december  year ended december  at december   total var usage measured million 
in no instance did our daily var measure exceed the board s approved limit 
the following table summarizes our aggregate average var by risk type for the periods presented 
average var for commodity risk remained insignificant for the periods shown 
var by risk type in millions average average interest rate risk equity risk foreign exchange risk aggregate price risk during  most of the price risk in our trading activities arose from foreign exchange trading 
the majority of foreign exchange risk related to our argentine currency position  which reflected prevailing economic conditions and argentine government measures implemented during the year 
these local government actions led to a significant reduction in market liquidity and the imposition of legal impediments to our ability to reduce our exposure  which resulted in an overall increase in our price risk during the year 
additional information concerning this currency position is included in the country risk section of this discussion and analysis 
risk from interest rate activities  which includes directional and spread components  arose primarily from trading activity in various domestic fixed income markets  the brazilian sovereign and high end corporate bond markets  and some exposure to fixed income markets in the asia pacific region 
the contribution to var from equity trading activities during declined significantly  as we discontin 
table of contents ued some of our equity oriented lines of business 
our leading nyse specialist firm generated most of these risks  with some contribution from the convertible bond trading and underwriting business  as well as our nasdaq market making activities 
on a continuing operations basis  aggregate var averaged million daily and ranged from a high of million to a low of million 
at december   total var usage measured million 
foreign exchange activities generated about of the aggregate var  while smaller portions of the combined risk arose from interest rate and equities activities 
our independent market risk management function routinely validates our measurement framework by conducting backtests  which compare the actual daily trading related results against the estimated var with a one day holding period 
the following graph presents this comparison for the twelve months ended december  in no instance did a daily aggregate trading loss exceed the one day aggregate var measure associated with that date  which compares very favorably with our expectation for less than three such breaches 
line graph on march   we suffered our largest single day trading loss in over three years  primarily due to argentine exposures 
on the strength of our diversified set of trading businesses  we more than recovered the loss during the following trading days  and the loss did not cause an overall breach of our risk measurement model 
in addition to the var framework  we employ other risk measurement tools to evaluate and control price risk 
these tools include cumulative loss limits and overall portfolio size limits  as well as regular stress tests and scenario analyses 
stress testing involves modifying the var model s assumptions to reflect rare events that have the potential for high impact 
scenario analyses involve calculating the impact of a pre determined set of events  irrespective of their statistical likelihood of occurrence 
such analyses may reflect historically observed market changes  incorporate specific scenarios that reflect some judgment about potential market conditions or identify the kind of scenario that would cause the most harm to existing positions 
during  we regularly evaluated and revised  as appropriate  these tests and analyses in light of ongoing market developments and conditions 
while the var framework and the additional risk measurement tools effectively ensure exposures remain within our expressed tolerance for price risk  they do not guarantee the avoidance of trading losses during periods of extreme volatility 
balance sheet management activities us dollar denominated risk management us dollar denominated assets and liabilities comprise the majority of our balance sheet 
interest rate risk  defined as the exposure of net income and financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates  is by far the most significant non trading market risk to which our us dollar denominated positions are exposed  and this risk results almost entirely from domestic operations 
the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk  both within limits approved by the board and within narrower guidelines approved by alccco 
these limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both short term and long term time horizons 
the major source of our non trading interest rate risk is the difference in the maturity and repricing characteristics between core banking assets and liabilities loans and deposits 
this difference  or mismatch  poses a risk to net interest income 
we control this risk by identifying and quantifying exposures through the use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models  as well as simpler gap analyses  reflecting the known or assumed maturity  repricing  and other cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities 
these exposures are hedged using mainly fixed rate portfolio securities  interest rate swaps and options  and  when appropriate  forward rate agreements  options on swaps  and exchange traded futures and options 
simulation analysis involves dynamically modeling interest income and expense from current assets  liabilities and derivative positions over a specified time period under various interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures  primarily to measure the sensitivity of net interest income over relatively short eg  year time horizons 
key assumptions in these simulation analyses and in the valuation analyses discussed below relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads  the growth or shrinkage of product balances and the behavior of deposit and loan customers  with the most material assumptions relating to repricing and or runoff of noncontractual deposits as well as the prepayment of mortgage assets 
as the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance  management uses simulation analysis to project earnings under various interest rate scenarios including reasonable or most likely  as well as deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely  scenarios 
thus  the analy 
table of contents ses may include immediate interest rate shocks  gradual interest rate ramps  spread narrowings widenings  and yield curve twists 
usually  each analysis incorporates what management believes to be the most appropriate assumptions about customer and competitor behavior in the specified interest rate scenario  but in some analyses  assumptions are deliberately manipulated to test our exposure to assumption risk 
in these analyses  we use the market s implied forecast for future interest rates as the base case 
as of december   the market assumed that the federal reserve board would keep short term interest rates steady for most of estimated exposures relate to variances in the future path of interest rates from this base case 
while we analyze a wide variety of interest rate scenarios  management believes that an immediate basis point shift is appropriately extreme to provide a robust measure of exposure 
in the current low rate environment  however  a decline of that magnitude would imply negative interest rates for some maturities and instruments 
in our basis point scenario  we do not permit any interest rate to drop below 
the following table reflects the estimated exposure of net interest income for the next twelve months  calculated as of december  and  due to an immediate basis point shift in forecasted interest rates 
estimated exposures set forth below are dependent on material assumptions such as those previously discussed 
estimated exposure to rate change net interest income basis points in millions as of december  as indicated  either an immediate basis point increase or an immediate basis point decrease in interest rates would tend to reduce net interest income  but by an amount that is well within our internal limits 
thus  the balance sheet position as of december  is symmetrical in its twelve month net interest income exposures 
while an immediate and severe shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under an extremely adverse scenario  management believes that the exposure of net interest income to gradual and modest changes in interest rates is relatively insignificant 
furthermore  it is important to note that  given the current low level of interest rates  this standard basis points scenario may be especially extreme as it implies a federal funds target interest rate at and long term rates at unprecedented lows 
estimated net interest income exposures at december  differ modestly from those at year end  mainly reflecting changes in the composition of the balance sheet 
early in  interest rate swaps were added to reduce exposure to declining interest rates  and throughout  residential mortgage assets were also added 
despite these actions  there is exposure related to the very low level of interest rates 
our overall interest rate risk position is approximately balanced 
the exposure to both sharp increases and decreases in interest rates as noted in the table above reflects the asymmetric maturity repricing of certain consumer assets and liabilities  specifically residential mortgages and consumer deposits 
for example  a further immediate basis point decline in interest rates would adversely impact net interest income by reducing the profitability of customer deposits and increasing prepayments of residential mortgages 
the exposure of annual net interest income to an immediate change in interest rates is reduced  or even reversed  under a gradual change 
for example  under a gradual basis point shift over one year  the estimated impact on annual net interest income is million  under a gradual basis point shift over one year  the estimated impact is million 
results for an immediate shock and a gradual ramp vary mainly because in the ramp  the impact of changes in interest rates on such factors as reinvestment yields  mortgage prepayment speeds and deposit rates is either diminished or delayed 
we also perform valuation analysis  which involves projecting future cash flows from current assets  liabilities and derivative positions over a very long term horizon  discounting those cash flows at appropriate interest rates  and then aggregating the discounted cash flows 
the economic value of equity or eve  is the estimated net present value of these discounted cash flows 
the sensitivity of eve to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the sensitivity of long term earnings to changes in interest rates  and is used primarily to measure the exposure of earnings and equity to changes in interest rates over a relatively long eg  year time horizon 
the following table reflects estimated eve exposures  calculated as of december  and  assuming an immediate shift in interest rates 
exposures are reported for shifts of basis points as well as basis points because the sensitivity of eve to changes in interest rates can be very nonlinear 
estimated exposure to rate change economic value basis points in millions as of december  as indicated  an immediate basis point decrease in interest rates would reduce eve  but by an amount that is within our internal limits 
while an immediate and severe shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under an extremely adverse scenario  management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact 
estimated eve exposures at december  are slightly larger and somewhat more asymmetrical than at year end additions of interest rate swaps and residential mortgage assets in eliminated the earlier benefit under a sharp increase in interest rates but  given 
table of contents prepayment risk  did not reduce exposure to a sharp decline in interest rates 
the very low level of interest rates continues to boost exposures  as any further immediate sharp decline in rates would reduce the profitability of customer deposits and increase the prepayment of residential mortgages 
non us dollar denominated risk management our non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities are exposed to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks 
the majority of the non us dollar denominated interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk exposure stems from operations in latin america  primarily argentina and brazil 
historically  our exposure to non trading interest rate risk in our latin american operations has not been significant  and at december   such risk continued to be insignificant outside of argentina 
within argentina  the ongoing political and economic instability has introduced several risks  including sovereign  cross border  credit  currency  and interest rate risks  which have become highly interrelated 
until the argentine crisis is resolved  the ultimate balances  currency denomination  repricing characteristics and maturity structure of certain assets and liabilities will remain uncertain  making it difficult to estimate precisely the amount of interest rate risk in that country 
exposure to foreign exchange rate risk in latin american operations is managed using currency limits as well as a var methodology  which is discussed in the trading activities section of this discussion and analysis 
additional information concerning our interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks associated with our operations in argentina is included in the country risk section of this discussion and analysis

various internal audit  compliance and operating risk activities measure and assess the control environment on an ongoing basis 
a continuous audit process is in place to monitor high risk activities throughout fleetboston 
quarterly  the current status of our internal controls is evaluated and reported to executive management and the audit committee of the board 
a similar process exists to monitor and report significant compliance activities 
we have targeted programs for monitoring privacy  money laundering deterrence  fraud prevention and operating losses 
the operating risk and compliance committees  comprised of senior managers  provide additional oversight 

table of contents capital management a financial institution s capital serves to support asset growth and provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors 
we strive to maintain an optimal level of capital  commensurate with our risk profile  on which an attractive return to stockholders will be realized over both the short and long term  while serving depositors  creditors and regulatory needs 
in determining optimal capital levels  we also consider the capital levels of our peers and the evaluations of the major rating agencies that assign ratings to our public debt 
common equity represents the stockholders investment in fleetboston 
in addition to common equity  regulatory capital includes  within certain limits  preferred stock  trust preferred securities  subordinated debt and the reserve for credit losses 
in blending the requirements of each of these constituencies  we have established target capital ranges that we believe will provide for management flexibility and the deployment of capital in an optimally efficient and profitable manner 
these targets are reviewed periodically relative to our risk profile and prevailing economic conditions 
we strive to maintain regulatory capital at approximately 
above the minimum regulatory requirements for a well capitalized institution  as defined in the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  or fdicia 
to be categorized as well capitalized  we must maintain a risk based total capital ratio of at least  a risk based tier capital ratio of at least  and a tier leverage ratio of at least and not be subject to a written agreement  order or capital directive with any of our regulators 
at december   we exceeded all regulatory required minimum capital ratios  and satisfied the requirements of the well capitalized category established by fdicia 
we also strive to maintain a tangible common equity to assets ratio of at least 
capital ratios a december risk adjusted assets in millions tier risk based capital minimum total risk based capital minimum leverage minimum common equity to assets total equity to assets tangible common equity to assets tangible common equity to managed assets tangible total equity to assets a all ratios include discontinued operations 
our risk based capital ratios increased compared with december   primarily due to a lower level of risk adjusted assets  mainly attributable to credit  particularly c i loans 
excess capital  defined as common equity above the capital target  is available for core business investments and acquisitions 
funds for cash distributions to our stockholders by our parent company are derived from a variety of sources 
the level of dividends paid to stockholders on our common stock  which currently approximates billion annually  is reviewed regularly and determined by the board considering our liquidity  asset quality profile  capital adequacy and recent earnings history and prospects  as well as economic conditions and other factors deemed relevant 
in addition  bank regulatory authorities have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends if they deem such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice 
at december   the parent company had billion of short term liquid assets with which to meet dividend declaration and other payment obligations 
information about restrictions concerning dividends from our subsidiary banks is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this report 
as registered brokers dealers and member firms of the nyse  certain of our subsidiaries are subject to rules of both the sec and the nyse 
these rules require members to maintain minimum levels of net capital  as defined  and may restrict a member from expanding its business and declaring dividends as its net capital approaches specified levels 
at december   these subsidiaries had aggregate net capital of approximately million  which exceeded aggregate minimum net capital requirements by approximately million

the decline was due to the impact of continued weakness in the us economy on our capital markets and investment services businesses  lower processing revenues due to the sale of our mortgage banking business and a lower level of branch divestiture gains 
partially offsetting these declines was a gain of million from the sale of our investment in the nyce corporation 
noninterest expense totaled billion in compared to billion in this decline was primarily due to lower compensation and benefit costs directly attributable to lower levels of revenue  as well as lower operating expenses resulting from merger integration activities and the corporate wide cost containment program  partially offset by merger and restructuring related charges from the summit acquisition and the loss on the sale of our mortgage banking business 
total loans and leases at december  were billion compared to billion at december  this decline was primarily composed of c i and consumer loans offset by an increase in international loans 
c i loans declined due to loan runoff and lower business volume in this portfolio  a result of weakened demand for loans in light of the economic slowdown 
the consumer loan decline was mainly related to the residential loan portfolio due to loan runoff and lower business volume in a refinancing environment 
these declines were partially offset by an increase in international loans due to continued growth in the brazilian portfolio  mainly trade related financing  as well as growth in europe and other latin american countries 
total deposits increased million to billion at december  due to an increase in domestic money market deposit accounts  partially offset by declines in time deposits  savings and now accounts and international deposits 
long term debt decreased billion to billion at december  due to net maturities of senior notes  partially offset by the issuance of trust preferred securities 
recent accounting and regulatory developments in january  in an effort to expand upon and strengthen existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
the interpretation applies to variable interest entities  or vies  many of which have been referred to as special purpose entities  or spes 
until now  a company generally included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
the fasb determined that this approach was not effective in identifying controlling financial interests in entities that are not controlled through voting interests  or in which the equity investors do not bear the residual economic risks and rewards 
the interpretation requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is the primary beneficiary of that entity 
the primary beneficiary is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the vie s activities  or is entitled to receive a majority of the vie s residual returns  or both 
the consolidation requirements of the interpretation apply immediately to vies created after january  and apply to previously established entities in the first interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the vie was established 
we are currently evaluating the significant spes with which we do business to determine whether they meet the definition of a vie and whether consolidation might be required by the interpretation 
as described in the liquidity risk management section of this discussion and analysis  as well as in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this report  these spes include securitization trusts  commercial paper conduits  and asset management vehicles 
the scope of the interpretation does not extend to securitization trusts that utilize qspes  which are defined by sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  and are not required to be consolidated by the transferor 
we believe it is reasonably possible that the commercial paper conduits and asset management vehicles meet the definition of a vie 
in addition  we may be required to consolidate the conduits  which held aggregate assets of billion at december  however  we are currently evaluating alternative structures that would permit some or all of the conduits to remain unconsolidated 
we are also evaluating each of our asset management vehicles to determine whether consolidation will be required 
in january  the federal financial institutions examination council  or ffiec  established new guidance concerning a variety of credit card lending issues related to account management  income recognition and 
table of contents loss allowance practices 
this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on fleetboston 
our past practices for estimating the credit loss reserves required relative to our overall credit card activities will be refined in to more specifically address uncollectible accrued interest and fees and our recent experience with the credit card receivable liquidation cycle 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the interpretation  which clarifies previously issued accounting guidance and disclosure requirements for guarantees  expands the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees  and requires the guarantor to recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee 
in general  the interpretation applies to contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on specified changes in an underlying variable that is related to an asset  liability  or equity security of the guaranteed party 
guarantee contracts excluded from both the disclosure and recognition requirements of the interpretation include  among others  guarantees relating to employee compensation  residual value guarantees under capital lease arrangements  commercial letters of credit  commitments to extend credit  subordinated interests in an spe  and guarantees of a company s own future performance 
other guarantees subject to the disclosure requirements of the interpretation  but not to the recognition provisions  include  among others  a guarantee accounted for as a derivative instrument under sfas no 
 a parent s guarantee of debt owed to a third party by its subsidiary or vice versa  and a guarantee which is based on performance but not price 
the disclosure requirements of the interpretation are effective for fleetboston as of december   and require disclosure of the nature of the guarantee  the maximum potential amount of future payments that the guarantor could be required to make under the guarantee  and the current amount of the liability  if any  for the guarantor s obligations under the guarantee 
the recognition requirements of the interpretation are to be applied prospectively to guarantees issued or modified after december  significant guarantees that have been entered into by fleetboston are disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this report

this standard is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   and generally requires costs associated with exit or disposal activities including costs related to involuntary terminations and contract termination costs to be recognized when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
specifically  costs associated with involuntary terminations are to be accrued on the date the employees are notified  assuming the period of time between the notification date and termination date is the lesser of days or the legally required notification period 
otherwise  these costs are to be recognized evenly over the period from notification to termination 
contract termination costs are to be recognized when the contract is legally terminated or when the economic benefits of the contract are no longer being realized
