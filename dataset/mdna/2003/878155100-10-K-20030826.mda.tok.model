with respect to industrial services  newer services comprise those services whose offerings began since fiscal year ndt inspection  field machining and technical bolting  and more recently  field valve repair 
traditional services include leak repair  hot tapping and fugitive emissions monitoring 
the following sets forth the components of revenue and operating profits for fiscal and increase revenues industrial services traditional services    newer services    total industrial services    equipment sales rentals    total revenues    operating profit industrial services    equipment sales rentals    corporate    total operating profit ebit    for the year  the industrial services business segment revenues increased to million 
segment operating profit increased to million 
all major service lines except ndt inspection services experienced growth during the year 
ndt inspection revenues were down slightly due to significantly reduced pipeline and pulp paper projects  which were nearly offset by continued growth in plant inspection services 
a significant contributor to the growth in traditional service lines came from new multi service  multi location contracts that commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal management believes that demand for the company s traditional services is  generally  a function of the population of high temperature  high pressure piping systems 
demand is also somewhat related  especially for leak repair and hot tapping  to the operating performance of our customers particularly in the refining  pipeline  and petrochemical industries 
generally  as those customers margins improve  more funds are expended for the specialized industrial services offered by the company 
the equipment sales and rental business segment encompassing climax portable machine tool company grew revenues about for the year to million 
the market for capital equipment continues to be depressed in most of the world markets 
revenue growth in asia offset flat to slightly depressed sales in the us and europe 
operating profit increased to  versus  in in  climax provided a  charge to other expense for estimated losses pertaining to a sales tax matter 
climax is domiciled in the state of oregon  which is a state that imposes no tax on sales originating there 
in fiscal  management determined that climax does have an obligation to collect and remit sales taxes in certain other jurisdictions  which it has not previously done 
climax is in the process of entering into agreements with several states with respect to sales tax obligations and is in the process of collecting amounts due from its customers 
the  charge represents management s estimate of the probable loss that climax will incur with respect to this matter 
the ultimate outcome is subject to a great deal of variables and cannot be determined with a certainty 
management expects that this issue will be fully resolved over the course of the next year and that the ultimate outcome  even if different than the amount provided  will not have a significant impact on the future operating results of climax 
with regard to consolidated operating results  overall gross margins were of revenues in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the decline primarily reflects the downturn in ndt inspection revenues associated with pipeline and pulp paper customer segments as well as lower product margins at climax due to an increase in lower margin international sales coupled with a strong margin comparison in fiscal due to a thousand special order in the fourth quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million in versus  an increase of 
the overall increase in sga reflects a ramp up of business development personnel in the industrial service segment ahead of related revenue growth and an increasing level of insurance and legal costs in fiscal in spite of these elements of cost increase  as a percentage of revenue  sg a was down of revenues in fiscal versus of revenues in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal revenues in were million compared to million in  an increase of 
this double digit revenue growth resulted in significant operating leverage for the company with operating profits earnings before interest and taxes  or ebit increasing by to million in as compared to million in operating profits in fiscal were impacted by a thousand non cash charge related to management stock options and by a severance charge in the climax business of thousand 
in contrast  operating profits in fiscal benefited from other income primarily gains on asset sales of thousand 
without regard to those elements of other income and expense  the operating profit improvement would have been year over year 
the improvement in operating results in was attributable both to the continued growth in newer services offered by the industrial services segment  as well as a rebound in profitability of the equipment sales and rental segment 
with respect to industrial services  newer services comprise those services whose offerings began during fiscal year ndt inspection  field machining and technical bolting 
traditional services include leak repair  hot tapping and fugitive emissions monitoring 
the following sets forth the components of revenue and operating profits for fiscal and increase revenues industrial services traditional services    new services    total industrial services    equipment sales rentals    total revenues    operating profit industrial services    equipment sales rentals    corporate    total operating profit ebit    as the table illustrates  year over year revenue growth in the industrial services segment came primarily from the newer service lines  which grew at a rate 
this growth has come primarily as a result of market share gains earned by improving the penetration of new service offerings to the company s traditional customer base as well as an increase in the demand for our inspection services to the pipeline industry due to new pipeline construction and increased regulatory activities in the pipeline industry 
through the third quarter which ended february   traditional service revenues were behind year over year amounts due to a significant softening in third quarter demand 
in the fourth quarter ended may   revenues from traditional services grew at a rate in comparison to the fourth quarter of fiscal  resulting in the nearly increase for the year overall 
the fourth quarter strengthening was impacted by two new multi location  multi service contracts that came on stream during the quarter 
the equipment sales and rental segment also achieved a strong rebound during the fourth quarter of the year 
through the third quarter  the segment had operated at a small loss year to date  partially due to the recognition of thousand of costs associated with a reduction in work force implemented in december in the fourth quarter  revenues increased compared to the same quarter of fiscal due principally to a thousand shipment to the us navy 
as a result of the strong revenue growth  operating profits for the segment were nearly thousand in the fourth quarter 
this strong performance in the quarter resulted in an operating profit for the year of thousand  a thousand improvement over the loss reported last year of thousand 
overall  gross margins were of revenues in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the improvement reflects better margins in both the industrial services segment and the equipment sales and rental segment 
industrial services margins improved primarily in the ndt inspection line due to better performance in texas locations 
climax margins improved due to cost reductions efforts and due to the business rebound experienced in the fourth quarter 
selling  general and administrative expenses were of revenues in fiscal versus of revenues in fiscal this reduction in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues illustrates the operating leverage that management believes exists in the business double digit revenue growth will result in a faster rate of increase in profits since revenue growth can be supported without a proportionate increase in selling  general and administrative costs 
the non cash g a compensation expense of thousand in fiscal was related to the vesting of performance stock options previously awarded to the company s chief executive officer

if deferred tax assets exceed deferred tax liabilities  the company must estimate whether those net deferred asset amounts will be realized in the future 
a valuation allowance is then provided for the net deferred asset amounts that are not likely to be realized
