item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is a consumer finance company specializing in purchasing retail automobile installment sales contracts originated by franchised and select independent dealers in connection with the sale of used and new automobiles 
the company generates revenue and cash flows primarily through the purchase  retention  subsequent securitization and servicing of finance receivables 
as used herein  loans include auto finance receivables originated by dealers and purchased by the company 
to fund the acquisition of receivables prior to securitization  the company uses borrowings under its warehouse credit facilities 
the company earns finance charge income on the finance receivables and pays interest expense on borrowings under its warehouse credit facilities 

table of contents the company periodically transfers receivables to securitization trusts trusts that  in turn  sell asset backed securities to investors 
the company retains an interest in the securitization transactions in the form of credit enhancement assets  including the estimated future excess cash flows expected to be received by the company over the life of the securitization 
excess cash flows result from the difference between the finance charges received from the obligors on the receivables and the interest paid to investors in the asset backed securities  net of credit losses and expenses 
excess cash flows from the trusts are initially utilized to fund credit enhancement requirements in order to attain specific credit ratings for the asset backed securities issued by the trusts 
once predetermined credit enhancement requirements are reached and maintained  excess cash flows are distributed to the company 
credit enhancement requirements will increase if targeted portfolio performance ratios are exceeded see liquidity and capital resources section 
in addition to excess cash flows  the company earns monthly base servicing income of per annum on the outstanding principal balance of domestic receivables securitized and collects other fees  such as late charges  as servicer for those trusts 
the company has changed the structure of its securitization transactions beginning with transactions closed subsequent to september   to no longer meet the criteria for sales of finance receivables 
accordingly  following a securitization  the finance receivables and the related securitization notes payable remain on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company recognizes finance charge and fee income on the receivables and interest expense on the securities issued in the securitization transaction  and records a provision for loan losses to cover probable loan losses on the receivables 
this change has significantly impacted the company s reported results of operations compared to its historical results because there is no gain on sale of receivables subsequent to september  accordingly  historical results may not be indicative of the company s future results 
the company reduced its workforce in november and implemented a revised operating plan in february in an effort to preserve and strengthen its capital and liquidity position 
the revised operating plan included a decrease in the company s targeted loan origination volume to approximately million per quarter and a reduction of operating expenses through downsizing its workforce  consolidating its branch office network and closing its canadian lending activities 
on april   the board of directors of the company announced the reorganization of the company s executive management team 
michael r 
barrington stepped down as president and chief executive officer and michael t 
miller stepped down as chief operating officer 
clifton h 
morris  jr  chairman of the board  assumed the chief executive officer position 
daniel e 
berce was promoted from chief financial officer to president 
preston a 
miller was promoted to chief financial officer and mark floyd was promoted to chief operating officer 
on august   the company issued a press release reporting a restatement of its financial statements for the year ended june   and for the first three quarters of the year ended june   as a result of a review of the accounting treatment under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas for certain interest rate swap agreements that were entered into prior to and used to hedge interest rate risk on a portion of its cash flows from credit enhancement assets 
the company enters into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in future excess cash flows attributable to fluctuations in interest rates on floating rate securities issued in connection with its securitizations accounted for as sales 
the cash flows are expected to be received over the life of the securitizations 
prior to calendar  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements outside of the securitization trusts  at the corporate level 
upon implementation of sfas on july   the swap agreements were valued and recorded separately from the credit enhancement assets on the consolidated balance sheets  with changes in the 
table of contents fair value of the interest rate swap agreements recorded in other comprehensive income 
unrealized losses or gains related to the interest rate swap agreements were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings as accretion was recorded on the hedged cash flows of the credit enhancement assets 
however  as unrealized gains related to the credit enhancement assets declined due to worse than expected credit losses and unrealized losses related to the interest rate swap agreements increased due to a declining interest rate environment  a combined net unrealized loss position developed in accumulated other comprehensive income 
previously  the company reclassified amounts from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings based upon the cash flows of the credit enhancement assets utilizing a discount rate which resulted in all of the remaining unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive income being reclassified into earnings in the same period when the remaining accretion on the credit enhancement assets was projected to be realized 
a review of this accounting treatment indicated that the company should have reclassified additional accumulated other comprehensive losses into earnings since the combination of the derivative instrument and the hedged item resulted in net unrealized losses that were not expected to be recovered in future periods 
accordingly  the company restated its financial statements for the year ended june   and for the first three quarters of the year ended june   to reclassify additional unrealized losses to net income from accumulated other comprehensive income 
additionally  in conjunction with the reclassification of unrealized losses to net income  the company also recorded an other than temporary impairment during the june quarter that resulted in a write down of credit enhancement assets and a million  net of tax  decrease in shareholders equity at june  the restatement had no effect on the cash flows of such transactions 
the company has been contacted by the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec and informally requested to provide the staff with certain documents and other information related to the restatement 
the company intends to voluntarily cooperate with this request and to assist the sec in its review of the restatement 
see additional discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the restatement resulted in the following changes to the financial statements for the year ended june  in thousands  except per share data year ended june  servicing income previous as restated income before income taxes previous as restated net income previous as restated diluted earnings per share previous as restated june  credit enhancement assets previous as restated accumulated other comprehensive income previous as restated shareholders equity previous as restated 
table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of revenue and costs and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates and those differences may be material 
the accounting estimates that the company believes are the most critical to understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results include the following gain on sale of receivables the company periodically transfers receivables to trusts that  in turn  sell asset backed securities to investors 
prior to october   the company recognized a gain on the sale of receivables to the trusts  which represents the difference between the sale proceeds to the company  net of transaction costs  and the company s net carrying value of the receivables  plus the present value of the estimated future excess cash flows to be received by the company over the life of the securitization 
the company has made assumptions in order to determine the present value of the estimated future excess cash flows to be generated by the pool of receivables sold 
the most significant assumptions made are the cumulative credit losses to be incurred on the pool of receivables sold  the timing of those losses and the rate at which the estimated future excess cash flows are discounted 
significant assumptions used in determining the gain on sale of auto receivables were as follows years ended june  cumulative credit losses including unrealized gains at time of sale discount rate used to estimate present value interest only receivables from trusts investments in trust receivables restricted cash the cumulative credit loss assumptions utilized at the time of sale of receivables were determined using a range of possible outcomes based on historical experience  credit attributes for the specific pool of receivables and general economic factors 
the unrealized gains at time of sale represent the excess of the fair value of credit enhancement assets over the company s carrying value related to such interests when receivables are sold 
the cumulative credit loss assumption  including unrealized gains at time of sale  reflects the approximate level that cumulative credit losses could reach notwithstanding other assumptions in a securitization pool before the credit enhancement assets would suffer an other than temporary impairment 
the discount rates used to estimate the present value of credit enhancement assets are based on the relative risks of each asset type 
interest only receivables from trusts represent estimated future excess cash flows in the trusts and have a first loss position to absorb any shortfall in trust cash flows due to adverse credit loss development or adverse changes in trust performance relative to other assumptions 
while the company earns a higher yield on its securitized receivables  the company utilizes a discount rate for interest only receivables from trusts since net undiscounted estimated future excess cash flows already incorporate a default assumption and the receivables underlying the securitization represent a diverse pool of assets 
restricted cash and investments in trust receivables are backed by cash and receivables and are senior to interest only receivables from trusts for credit enhancement purposes 
accordingly  restricted cash and investments in trust receivables are assigned a lower discount rate than the interest only receivables from trusts 
the assumptions used represent the company s best estimates 
the use of different assumptions would produce different financial results 
see additional discussion regarding sensitivity analysis surrounding assumptions used in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents fair value measurements certain of the company s assets  including the company s derivative financial instruments and credit enhancement assets related to gain on sale trusts  are recorded at fair value 
fair values for derivative financial instruments are based on third party quoted market prices  where possible 
however  market prices are not readily available for the company s credit enhancement assets and  accordingly  fair value is determined using discounted cash flow models 
the most significant assumptions made are the cumulative net credit losses to be incurred on the pool of receivables sold  the timing of those losses and the rate at which estimated future excess cash flows are discounted 
the assumptions used represent the company s best estimates 
the use of different assumptions would result in different carrying values for the company s credit enhancement assets and changes in the accretion of present value discount and impairment of credit enhancement assets recognized through the consolidated statements of income 
additionally  if actual cumulative net credit losses exceed the company s estimate  additional impairment of credit enhancement assets could result 
allowance for loan losses the company reviews charge off experience factors  delinquency reports  historical collection rates  estimates of the value of the underlying collateral  economic trends  such as unemployment rates  and other information in order to make the necessary judgments as to probable credit losses on finance receivables 
receivables  including accrued interest  are charged off to the allowance for loan losses when the company repossesses and disposes of the collateral or the account is otherwise deemed uncollectable 
as of june   the company believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable losses inherent in its receivables  however  because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  there can be no assurance that the ultimate charge off amount will not exceed such estimates  which would result in an additional charge to operations

 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  on july  unrealized gains and losses on derivatives that arose prior to the initial application of sfas and that were previously deferred as adjustments of the carrying amount of hedged items were not adjusted 
accordingly  the company did not record a transition adjustment from the adoption of sfas the company sells fixed rate auto receivables to trusts that  in turn  sell either fixed rate or floating rate securities to investors 
the interest rates on the floating rate securities issued by the trusts are indexed to various london interbank offered rates libor 
the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to convert floating rate exposures on securities issued by the trusts to fixed rates  hedging the variability in future excess cash flows to be received by the company over the life of the securitization attributable to interest rate risk 
these interest rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges and are highly effective in hedging the company s exposure to interest rate risk from both an accounting and economic perspective 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements is included in the company s consolidated balance sheets  and the related unrealized gains or losses on these agreements are deferred and included in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
these unrealized gains or losses are recognized as an adjustment to income over the same period in which cash flows from the related credit enhancement assets affect earnings 
however  if the company expects the continued reporting of a loss in 
table of contents accumulated other comprehensive income would lead to recognizing a net loss on the combination of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged asset  the loss is reclassified to earnings for the amount that is not expected to be recovered 
additionally  to the extent that any of these contracts are not considered to be perfectly effective in offsetting the change in the value of the cash flows being hedged  any changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion of these contracts are recognized in income 
during fiscal  the company also utilized an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the change in fair value of certain of its fixed rate senior notes 
the change in fair value of the interest rate swap agreement and the senior notes were recognized in income 
the interest rate swap agreement has been terminated and the previous adjustments to the carrying value of the senior notes are being amortized into interest expense over the expected life of the senior notes on an effective yield basis 
the company formally documents all relationships between interest rate swap agreements and the underlying asset  liability or cash flows being hedged  as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transactions 
at hedge inception and at least quarterly  the company also formally assesses whether the interest rate swap agreements that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows or fair value of the hedged items and whether those interest rate swap agreements may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods 
the company will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that an interest rate swap agreement has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge 
the company also utilizes interest rate cap agreements as part of its interest rate risk management strategy for securitization transactions as well as for warehouse credit facilities 
the trusts and the company s wholly owned special purpose finance subsidiaries typically purchase interest rate cap agreements to limit variability in excess cash flows from receivables sold to the trusts or financed under warehouse credit facilities due to potential increases in interest rates 
the purchaser of the interest rate cap agreement pays a premium in return for the right to receive the difference in the interest cost at any time a specified index of market interest rates rises above the stipulated cap rate 
the interest rate cap agreement purchaser bears no obligation or liability if interest rates fall below the cap rate 
the company s special purpose finance subsidiaries are contractually required to purchase interest rate cap agreements as credit enhancement in connection with securitization transactions and warehouse credit facilities 
as part of the company s interest rate risk management strategy and when economically feasible  the company may simultaneously sell a corresponding interest rate cap agreement in order to offset the premium paid to purchase the interest rate cap agreement and thus retain the interest rate risk 
the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements purchased and sold by the company is included in other assets and derivative financial instruments  respectively  on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the intrinsic value of the interest rate cap agreements purchased by the trusts is reflected in the valuation of the credit enhancement assets 
the company does not hold any interest rate cap or swap agreements for trading purposes 
results of operations year ended june  as compared to year ended june  revenue the company s average managed receivables outstanding consisted of the following in thousands years ended june  auto on book gain on sale total managed 
table of contents average managed receivables outstanding increased by as a result of the purchase of loans in excess of collections and charge offs 
the company purchased  million of auto loans during fiscal  compared to purchases of  million during fiscal this decrease resulted from a reduction in the number of the company s branch offices in connection with the company s revised operating plan implemented in february the company operated auto lending branch offices as of june   compared to as of june  the average new loan size was  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the increase in average new loan size was due to a change in the mix of business towards financing later model vehicles 
the average annual percentage rate for finance receivables purchased during fiscal was  compared to during fiscal decreasing short term market interest rates have lowered the company s cost of funds  allowing the company to pass along some of this benefit to consumers in the form of lower loan pricing 
finance charge income increased by to million for fiscal from million for fiscal finance charge income was higher due to an increase in average on book receivables that resulted primarily from the company s decision to structure securitization transactions as secured financings 
the company s effective yield on its on book finance receivables decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the effective yield is higher than the contractual rates of the company s auto finance contracts as a result of finance charge income earned between the date the auto finance contract is originated by the automobile dealership and the date the auto finance contract is funded by the company 
the effective yield decreased for fiscal due to lower levels of finance charges earned between the origination date and funding date as well as lower loan pricing 
the gain on sale of receivables decreased by to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease in gain on sale of receivables resulted from the company s decision to structure securitization transactions subsequent to september   to no longer meet the criteria for sales of finance receivables 
during fiscal   million of finance receivables securitized were accounted for as sales of receivables as compared to  million during fiscal the gain as a percentage of the receivables securitized in gain on sale trusts remained relatively stable at for fiscal as compared to for fiscal servicing income was million  or of average gain on sale auto receivables  for fiscal  compared to million  or of average gain on sale auto receivables  for fiscal servicing income represents accretion of the present value discount  base servicing fees  and other fees earned by the company as servicer of the receivables sold to the trusts 
servicing income also includes other than temporary impairment charges of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
other than temporary impairment resulted from increased default rates caused by continued weakness in the economy  lower than expected recovery proceeds caused by depressed used car values and the expectation that current economic conditions will continue for the foreseeable future 
in addition  the company s credit enhancement assets are carried on its financial statements based on the present value of future excess cash flows to be received by the company from securitization trusts 
in fiscal  the expected delay in cash distributions from the fsa program securitizations due to breaches of certain portfolio performance ratios and  to a lesser extent  additional insurance fees payable to fsa in connection with the amendment to the event of default net loss ratios reduced the present value of such cash distributions and resulted in other than temporary impairment 
other income was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the increase in other income is primarily due to investment income earned on higher average cash and restricted cash balances  an increase in late fees collected on finance receivables held by the company and additional other fees received 
costs and expenses operating expenses decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of average managed receivables outstanding  operating expenses decreased to for fiscal  
table of contents compared to for fiscal operating expenses declined primarily as a result of a reduction in workforce in november and implementation of a revised operating plan in february the company recognized million in restructuring charges including million for its november reduction in workforce and million related to the implementation of a revised operating plan in february the revised operating plan included a decrease in the company s targeted loan origination volume to approximately million per quarter and a reduction of operating expenses 
the restructuring charges consisted primarily of severance costs of identified workforce reductions of approximately  positions related to the consolidation closing of branch offices including the closing of the company s canadian lending activities  costs incurred to terminate facility and equipment leases prior to their expiration date as well as estimated costs that will continue to be incurred under the contracts for their remaining terms without economic benefit to the company 
the restructuring charges also include million of previously capitalized costs for discontinuation of the development of the company s customer relationship management system  which was designed to provide operational scalability and marketing benefits in a high growth environment 
the provision for loan losses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as an annualized percentage of average on book receivables  the provision for loan losses was and for fiscal and  respectively 
subsequent to september   the company changed the structure of its securitization transactions to no longer meet the criteria for sales of finance receivables 
under this new structure  finance receivables remain on the company s balance sheet throughout their term  and credit losses related to those securitized receivables are provided for as a charge to operations 
the remaining increase reflects the general expectation that current economic conditions  including elevated unemployment rates  will result in a higher number of charge offs  and that depressed wholesale auction prices on the sale of repossessed vehicles will result in a higher amount charged off per loan 
interest expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due to higher debt levels 
average debt outstanding was  million and  million for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in average debt outstanding results from the company s decision to structure securitization transactions subsequent to september   as secured financings 
the company s effective rate of interest paid on its debt decreased to from as a result of lower short term market interest rates

unrealized gains at time of sale were lower for fiscal as compared to fiscal due to the change in the structure of securitization transactions entered into subsequent to september   to no longer meet the criteria for sales of finance receivables 
changes in the fair value of credit enhancement assets as a result of modifications to the credit loss assumptions are reported as unrealized gains in other comprehensive loss until realized  or  in the case of unrealized losses considered to be other than temporary  as a charge to operations 
the cumulative credit loss assumptions used to estimate the fair value of credit enhancement assets are periodically reviewed by the company and modified to reflect the actual credit performance for each securitization pool through the reporting date as well as estimates of future losses considering several factors including changes in the general economy 
differences between cumulative credit loss assumptions used in individual securitization pools can be attributed to the original credit attributes of a pool  actual credit performance through the reporting date and pool seasoning to the extent that changes in economic trends will have more of an impact on the expected future performance of less seasoned pools 
the company increased the cumulative credit loss assumptions including remaining unrealized gains at time of sale used in measuring the fair value of credit enhancement assets to a range of to as of june   from a range of to as of june   which  together with the expected delay in cash distributions from the fsa program  caused an other than temporary impairment charge of million and a decrease in unrealized gains of million for fiscal the range of cumulative credit loss assumptions was increased to reflect adverse actual credit performance compared to previous assumptions as well as expectations for higher future losses due to continued weakness in the general economy 
the increase in unrealized gains of million for fiscal was due to the decline in the carrying value of credit enhancement assets resulting from the reclassification of unrealized gains and losses between credit enhancement assets and cash flow hedges 
this was partially offset by an increase in the range of cumulative credit loss assumptions for securitization trusts to reflect adverse actual credit performance compared to previous assumptions as well as expectations for higher future losses due to economic weakness 
cumulative credit loss assumptions including remaining unrealized gains at time of sale used in measuring the fair value of credit enhancement assets ranged from to as of june   as compared to to as of june  decreases in unrealized gains related to changes in interest rates of million and million for fiscal and  respectively  resulted primarily from a decline in estimated future cash flows to be generated from investment income earned on the restricted cash and trust collections accounts due to lower interest rates 
the lower earnings were partially offset by an increase in value associated with a decrease in interest rates payable to investors on the floating rate tranches of securitization transactions 
net unrealized gains of million and million were reclassified into earnings through accretion during fiscal and  respectively  and relate primarily to recognition of actual excess cash collected over

cash flow hedges unrealized losses on cash flow hedges decreased by million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings as unrealized gains or losses related to interest rate fluctuations on the company s credit enhancement assets are reclassified 
however  if the company expects the continued reporting of a loss in accumulated other comprehensive income would lead to recognizing a net loss on the combination of the interest rate swap agreements and the credit enhancement assets  the loss is reclassified to earnings for the amount that is not expected to be recovered 
net unrealized losses reclassified into earnings were million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
canadian currency translation adjustment canadian currency translation adjustment gains of million and million for fiscal and  respectively  were included in other comprehensive loss 
this unrealized gain is due to the increase in the value of the company s canadian dollar denominated assets related to the decline in the us dollar to canadian dollar conversion rates during the years 
the company does not anticipate the settlement of intercompany transactions with its canadian subsidiaries in the foreseeable future 
net margin net margin is the difference between finance charge and other income earned on the company s receivables and the cost to fund the receivables as well as the cost of debt incurred for general corporate purposes 
the company s net margin as reflected on the consolidated statements of income is as follows in thousands years ended june  finance charge and other income interest expense net margin the company evaluates the profitability of its lending activities based partly upon the net margin related to its managed auto loan portfolio  including on book and gain on sale receivables 
the company uses this information to analyze trends in the components of the profitability of its managed auto portfolio 
analysis of net margin on a managed basis allows the company to determine which origination channels and loan products are most profitable  guides the company in making pricing decisions for loan products and indicates if sufficient spread exists between the company s revenues and cost of funds to cover operating expenses and achieve corporate profitability objectives 
additionally  net margin on a managed basis facilitates comparisons of results between the company and other finance companies i that do not securitize their receivables or ii due to the structure of their securitization transactions  are not required to account for the securitization of their receivables as a sale 
the company routinely securitizes its receivables and prior to october   recorded a gain on the sale of such receivables

net unrealized gains of million and million were reclassified into earnings through accretion during fiscal and  respectively  and relate primarily to the recognition of actual excess cash collected over the company s initial estimate and recognition of unrealized gains at time of sale 
the increase in amounts reclassified into earnings was due to the reclassification of unrealized gains and losses between credit enhancement assets and cash flow hedges resulting from the restatement 
cash flow hedges unrealized losses on cash flow hedges decreased by million in fiscal and increased by million in fiscal short term market interest rates decreased during fiscal and  resulting in an increase in the liability related to the company s interest rate swap agreements 
the increase in liability was reduced by the decline in the amount of interest rate swap agreements held by the company 
the unrealized losses decreased in fiscal  since  commencing in january  interest rate swap agreements have been executed within the trusts  thus neutralizing the impact of changes in interest rates except relative to investment income on the fair value of credit enhancement assets for trusts established thereafter 
unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings as unrealized gains or losses related to interest rate fluctuations on the company s credit enhancement assets are reclassified 
however  if the company expects the continued reporting of a loss in accumulated other comprehensive income would lead to recognizing a net loss on the combination of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged asset  the loss is reclassified to earnings for the amount that is not expected to be recovered 
net unrealized losses reclassified into earnings were million for fiscal 
table of contents net margin net margin is the difference between finance charge and other income earned on the company s receivables and the cost to fund the receivables as well as the cost of debt incurred for general corporate purposes 
the company s net margin as reflected on the consolidated statements of income is as follows in thousands years ended june  finance charge and other income interest expense net margin the company evaluates the profitability of its lending activities based partly upon the net margin related to its managed auto loan portfolio  including on book and gain on sale receivables 
the company uses this information to analyze trends in the components of the profitability of its managed auto portfolio 
analysis of net margin on a managed basis allows the company to determine which origination channels and loan products are most profitable  guides the company in making pricing decisions for loan products and indicates if sufficient spread exists between the company s revenues and cost of funds to cover operating expenses and achieve corporate profitability objectives 
additionally  net margin on a managed basis facilitates comparisons of results between the company and other finance companies i that do not securitize their receivables or ii due to the structure of their securitization transactions  are not required to account for the securitization of their receivables as a sale 
the company routinely securitizes its receivables and prior to october   recorded a gain on the sale of such receivables 
the net margin on a managed basis presented below assumes that all securitized receivables have not been sold and are still on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
accordingly  no gain on sale or servicing income would have been recognized 
instead  finance charges would be recognized over the life of the securitized receivables as earned  and interest and other costs related to the asset backed securities would be recognized as incurred 
net margin for the company s managed finance receivables portfolio is as follows in thousands years ended june  finance charge and other income interest expense net margin net margin as a percentage of average managed finance receivables outstanding is as follows dollars in thousands years ended june  finance charge and other income interest expense net margin as a percentage of average managed auto receivables average managed auto receivables net margin as a percentage of average managed auto receivables increased for fiscal compared to fiscal as the company was able to retain some of the benefit of declining interest rates in its loan pricing strategies

finance receivables on the company s balance sheets include receivables purchased but not yet securitized and receivables securitized by the company after september  provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses on the balance sheet at a level considered adequate to cover probable credit losses on finance receivables at june  finance receivables are charged off to the allowance for loan losses when the company repossesses and disposes of the collateral or the account is otherwise deemed uncollectable 
prior to october   the company periodically sold receivables to trusts in securitization transactions accounted for as a sale of receivables and retained an interest in the receivables sold in the form of credit enhancement assets 
credit enhancement assets are reflected on the company s balance sheet at fair value  calculated based upon the present value of estimated excess future cash flows from the trusts using  among other assumptions  estimates of future credit losses on the receivables sold 
charge offs of receivables that have been sold to trusts decrease the amount of excess future cash flows from the trusts 
if such charge offs are expected to exceed the company s original estimates of cumulative credit losses or if the actual timing of these losses differs from expected timing  the fair value of credit enhancement assets is written down through an other than temporary impairment charge to earnings to the extent the write down exceeds any unrealized gain

due to 
table of contents the company s target customer base  a relatively high percentage of accounts become delinquent at some point in the life of a loan and there is a high rate of account movement between current and delinquent status in the portfolio 
delinquencies were higher as of june   compared to june   due to continued weakness in the economy  including higher unemployment rates  and an increase in the average age of the company s managed receivables portfolio 
in accordance with its policies and guidelines  the company  at times  offers payment deferrals to consumers  whereby the consumer is allowed to move a delinquent payment to the end of the loan generally by paying a fee approximately the interest portion of the payment deferred 
the company s policies and guidelines  as well as certain contractual restrictions in the company s warehouse credit facilities and securitization transactions  limit the number and frequency of deferments that may be granted 
an account for which all delinquent payments are deferred is classified as current at the time the deferment is granted 
thereafter  such account is aged based on the timely payment of future installments in the same manner as any other account 
contracts receiving a payment deferral as an average quarterly percentage of average managed auto receivables outstanding were  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
of the total amount deferred  on book finance receivables receiving a payment deferral were  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the percentage of contracts receiving a payment deferral increased during fiscal  compared to fiscal and due to the company providing deferments to an increased number of consumers who were temporarily unable to make monthly payments as originally contracted due to weak economic conditions 
the following is a summary of total deferrals as a percentage of managed receivables outstanding june  never deferred deferred times times greater than times total deferred total the company evaluates the results of its deferment strategies based upon the amount of cash installments that are collected on accounts that have been deferred versus the extent to which the collateral underlying deferred accounts has depreciated over the same period of time

net charge offs increased for fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal due to continued weakness in the economy  including higher unemployment rates  and lower net recoveries on repossessed vehicles 
recoveries as a percentage of repossession charge offs decreased due to general declines in used car auction values 
in addition  the company implemented a more aggressive strategy for repossessing and liquidating late stage delinquent accounts in early calendar resulting in a higher level of charge offs for fiscal liquidity and capital resources general the company s primary sources of cash have been borrowings under its warehouse credit facilities and transfers of finance receivables to its whole loan purchase facility and to trusts in securitization transactions 
the company s primary uses of cash have been purchases of finance receivables and funding credit enhancement requirements for securitization transactions 
the company used cash of  million   million and  million for the purchase of finance receivables during fiscal  and  respectively 
these purchases were funded initially utilizing warehouse credit facilities and subsequently through either the sale of finance receivables or the long term financing of finance receivables in securitization or whole loan purchase transactions

the company s warehouse credit facilities contain various default covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and cumulative net loss  delinquency and repossession ratios 
as of june   none of the company s warehouse credit facilities had financial ratios or performance ratios in excess of the targeted levels 
within the next twelve months   million of the company s warehouse credit facilities are up for renewal 
to continue to realign the company s warehouse capacity with lower future loan origination volume  the company anticipates that certain warehouse facilities will not be renewed or will be cancelled 
the company believes the capacity available under the remaining warehouse credit facilities will be sufficient to meet the company s warehouse funding needs for fiscal whole loan purchase facility in march  the company entered into a whole loan purchase facility with an original term of approximately four years under which the company transferred billion of finance receivables to a special purpose finance subsidiary of the company and received an advance of million from the purchaser 
additionally  the company issued a million note to the purchaser representing debt issuance costs in the form of a residual interest in the finance receivables transferred

table of contents prior to october   the company structured its securitization transactions to meet the criteria for sales of finance receivables under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the company changed the structure of securitization transactions completed subsequent to september   to no longer meet the criteria for sale of finance receivables 
this change in securitization structure does not change the company s requirement to provide credit enhancement in order to attain specific credit ratings for the asset backed securities issued by the trusts 
the company typically makes an initial deposit to a restricted cash account and transfers finance receivables in excess of the amount of asset backed securities issued to create initial overcollateralization 
the company subsequently uses excess cash flows generated by the trusts to either increase the restricted cash account or repay the outstanding asset backed securities on an accelerated basis  thereby creating additional credit enhancement through overcollateralization in the trusts 
when the credit enhancement levels reach specified percentages of the trust s pool of receivables  excess cash flows are distributed to the company 
the company employs two types of securitization structures to meet its credit enhancement requirements 
the structure the company has utilized most frequently involves the purchase of a financial guaranty policy issued by an insurer to cover the asset backed securities as well as the use of reinsurance and other alternative credit enhancement products to reduce the required initial deposit to the restricted cash account and initial overcollateralization 
however  the company currently has no outstanding commitments to obtain reinsurance or other alternative credit enhancement products and will likely be required to provide initial credit enhancement deposits in future securitization transactions from its existing capital resources 
the company s second type of securitization structure involves the sale of subordinated asset backed securities in order to provide credit enhancement for the senior asset backed securities 
the subordinated asset backed securities replace a portion of the company s initial credit enhancement deposit otherwise required in a securitization transaction in a manner similar to the utilization of reinsurance or other alternative credit enhancements described in the preceding paragraphs 
the company has a revolving credit enhancement facility that provides for borrowings up to million for the financing of bonds rated bbb and bb by the rating agencies in connection with subordinated securitization transactions 
in august  the company reduced available borrowings under this facility to million and extended its expiration date to november the initial cash deposit and overcollateralization transfer as well as the targeted levels of credit enhancement required in the company s recent securitization transactions were higher than the levels required in the company s prior securitization transactions 
initial cash deposit and overcollateralization levels were raised to from of the original receivable pool balance and credit enhancement levels now must reach compared to the previous requirement of of the receivable pool balance before cash is distributed to the company 
under this structure  the company expects to begin to receive cash distributions approximately to months after receivables are securitized 
the company believes that additional securitizations completed in fiscal will require these higher credit enhancement levels 
cash flows related to securitization transactions were as follows in millions years ended june  initial credit enhancement deposits gain on sale trusts restricted cash overcollateralization borrowings under credit enhancement facility secured financing trusts restricted cash overcollateralization distributions from trusts  net of swap payments gain on sale trusts secured financing trusts 
table of contents with respect to the company s securitization transactions covered by a financial guaranty insurance policy  agreements with the insurers provide that if portfolio performance ratios delinquency  default or net loss triggers in a trust s pool of receivables exceed certain targets  the specified credit enhancement levels would be increased 
if a targeted portfolio performance ratio was exceeded in any securitization that is part of the fsa program and a waiver was not granted by fsa  excess cash flows from all of the company s fsa program securitizations could be used by fsa to increase credit enhancement for the securitization in which a ratio was exceeded to higher specified levels rather than being distributed to the company 
the company has exceeded its targeted net loss triggers in five fsa program securitization transactions 
waivers were not granted by fsa 
accordingly  million of cash generated by fsa program securitization transactions otherwise distributable by the trusts from march to june has been used to fund increased credit enhancement levels for the securitizations that breached their net loss triggers 
the company believes that it is probable that net loss triggers on additional fsa program securitization trusts will exceed targeted levels during fiscal the company does not expect waivers to be granted by fsa in the future with respect to securitizations that breach portfolio performance triggers and estimates that cash otherwise distributable by the trusts on fsa program securitization transactions will be used to increase credit enhancement for other fsa program transactions rather than released to the company 
the company s securitization transactions insured by financial guaranty insurance providers since october are cross collateralized to a more limited extent 
in the event of a shortfall in the original minimum credit enhancement requirement for any of these securitization trusts after a certain period of time  excess cash flows from other transactions insured by the same insurance provider would be used to satisfy the shortfall amount 
in addition  excess cash flows from certain securitization transactions would be utilized to satisfy any increased minimum credit enhancement requirements resulting from a breach of portfolio performance ratios in other transactions insured by the same insurance provider if a secured party receives a notice of a rating agency review for downgrade or if there is a downgrade of any class of notes without taking into consideration the presence of the financial guaranty insurance policy 
agreements with the company s financial guaranty insurance providers contain additional specified targeted portfolio performance ratios that are higher than the limits referred to in the preceding paragraphs 
if  at any measurement date  the targeted portfolio performance ratios with respect to any insured trust were to exceed these additional levels  provisions of the agreements permit the company s financial guaranty insurance providers to terminate the company s servicing rights to the receivables sold to that trust 
in addition  the servicing agreements on certain insured securitization trusts are cross defaulted such that a default under one servicing agreement would allow the financial guaranty insurance providers to terminate the company s servicing rights under all servicing agreements for securitization trusts in which they issued a financial guaranty insurance policy 
in july  the company amended the cumulative net loss event of default triggers for all of the company s fsa program transactions completed in  and in exchange for an increase in the related insurance premium 
although the company has never exceeded these additional targeted portfolio performance ratios  and with the amendment does not anticipate violating any event of default triggers for its fsa program securitizations  there can be no assurance that the company s servicing rights with respect to the automobile receivables in such trusts or any other trusts will not be terminated if i such targeted portfolio performance ratios are breached  ii the company breaches its obligations under the servicing agreements  iii the financial guaranty insurance providers are required to make payments under a policy  or iv certain bankruptcy or insolvency events were to occur 
as of june   no such termination events have occurred with respect to any of the trusts formed by the company 
secondary offering on october   the company completed a secondary offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
on november   an additional  shares were issued to cover over allotments 
the net proceeds of the secondary offering were approximately million 
the company used 
table of contents the proceeds of the secondary offering for initial credit enhancement deposits in securitization transactions subsequent to september   and for other working capital needs 
credit ratings during fiscal  standard poor s rating services  fitch ratings and moody s investors service downgraded the company s credit rating to b  b and b  respectively 
these downgrades resulted in decreased limits on derivative collateral lines and lower advance rates on certain warehouse credit facilities 
in august  standard poor s rating services downgraded the company s credit rating to b 
this downgrade did not have an impact on the company s financial or liquidity position 
operating plan in february  the company implemented a revised operating plan in an effort to preserve and strengthen its capital and liquidity position 
the plan included a decrease in targeted loan origination volume to approximately million per quarter and a reduction of operating expenses through downsizing its workforce  consolidating its branch office network and closing the canadian lending activities 
during the quarter ended june   the company increased its cash balances by million largely due to the origination volume and cost reductions made under the revised operating plan 
subject to continued access to the whole loan and securitization markets  the company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to operate under its new plan through fiscal the company will continue to require the execution of additional securitization or whole loan purchase transactions in order to fund its lending activities through fiscal in addition  the company believes that it must utilize a securitization structure involving the purchase of a financial guaranty insurance policy in order to execute such securitization transactions based on current market conditions 
there can be no assurance that funding will be available to the company through the execution of securitization transactions or  if available  that the funding will be on acceptable terms 
if the company is unable to execute securitization or whole loan purchase transactions on a regular basis  it would not have sufficient funds to finance new loan originations and  in such event  the company would be required to further revise the scale of its business  including possible discontinuation of loan origination activities  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to achieve its business and financial objectives 
off balance sheet arrangements prior to october   the company structured its securitization transactions to meet the criteria for sales of finance receivables 
under this structure  notes issued by the company s unconsolidated qualified special purpose finance subsidiaries are not recorded as a liability on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
see liquidity and capital resources securitization for a detailed discussion of the company s securitization transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk fluctuations in market interest rates impact the company s warehouse credit facilities and securitization transactions 
the company s gross interest rate spread  which is the difference between interest earned on its finance receivables and interest paid  is affected by changes in interest rates as a result of the company s dependence upon the issuance of variable rate securities and the incurrence of variable rate debt to fund its purchases of finance receivables 
warehouse credit facilities finance receivables purchased by the company and pledged to secure borrowings under its warehouse credit facilities bear fixed interest rates 
amounts borrowed under the company s warehouse credit facilities bear 
table of contents interest at variable rates that are subject to frequent adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates 
to protect the interest rate spread within each warehouse credit facility  the company s special purpose finance subsidiaries are contractually required to purchase interest rate cap agreements in connection with borrowings under the company s warehouse credit facilities 
the purchaser of the interest rate cap agreement pays a premium in return for the right to receive the difference in the interest cost at any time a specified index of market interest rates rises above the stipulated cap rate 
the purchaser of the interest rate cap agreement bears no obligation or liability if interest rates fall below the cap rate 
as part of the company s interest rate risk management strategy and when economically feasible  the company may simultaneously sell a corresponding interest rate cap agreement in order to offset the premium paid to purchase the interest rate cap agreement and thus retain the interest rate risk 
the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements purchased and sold is included in other assets and derivative financial instruments  respectively  on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
securitizations the interest rate demanded by investors in the company s securitization transactions depends on prevailing market interest rates for comparable transactions and the general interest rate environment 
securities issued under the company s securitization transactions may bear fixed or variable interest rates 
the company utilizes several strategies to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations on its gross interest rate margin  including the use of derivative financial instruments  the regular sale or pledging of auto receivables to securitization trusts and pre funding of securitization transactions 
in its securitization transactions  the company transfers fixed rate finance receivables to trusts that  in turn  sell either fixed rate or floating rate securities to investors 
the fixed rates on securities issued by the trusts are indexed to market interest rate swap spreads for transactions of similar duration or various london interbank offered rates libor and do not fluctuate during the term of the securitization 
the floating rates on securities issued by the trusts are indexed to libor and fluctuate periodically based on movements in libor 
derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swap and cap agreements  are used to manage the gross interest rate spread on these transactions 
the company uses interest rate swap agreements to convert the variable rate exposures on these securities to a fixed rate  thereby i locking in the gross interest rate spread to be earned by the company over the life of a securitization accounted for as a secured financing that would have been affected by changes in interest rates or ii hedging the variability in future excess cash flows to be received by the company over the life of a securitization accounted for as a sale that would have been attributable to interest rate risk 
the company utilizes such arrangements to modify its net interest sensitivity to levels deemed appropriate based on the company s risk tolerance 
in circumstances where the interest rate risk is deemed to be tolerable  usually if the risk is less than one year in term at inception  the company may choose not to hedge potential fluctuations in cash flows due to changes in interest rates 
the company s special purpose finance subsidiaries are contractually required to provide additional credit enhancement on their floating rate securities even if the company chooses not to hedge its future cash flows 
to comply with this requirement  the special purpose finance subsidiary purchases an interest rate cap agreement 
when economically feasible  the company may simultaneously sell a corresponding interest rate cap agreement to offset the premium paid to purchase the interest rate cap agreement 
the intrinsic value of the interest rate cap agreements purchased by the non consolidated special purpose finance subsidiaries is considered in the valuation of the credit enhancement assets 
the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements sold by the company is included in derivative financial instruments on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements sold by the company are reflected in interest expense 
pre funding securitizations is the practice of issuing more asset backed securities than needed to cover finance receivables initially sold or pledged to the trust 
the proceeds from the pre funded portion are held in an escrow account until additional receivables are delivered to the trust in amounts up to the pre funded balance held in the escrow account 
the use of pre funded securitizations allows the company to lock in borrowing costs with respect to the finance receivables subsequently delivered to the trust 
however  the company incurs an 
table of contents expense in pre funded securitizations during the period between the initial securitization and the subsequent delivery of finance receivables equal to the difference between the interest earned on the proceeds held in the escrow account and the interest rate paid on the asset backed securities outstanding 
senior notes the company also used an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the fair value of certain of its fixed rate senior notes 
in august  the company terminated this interest rate swap agreement 
the fair value of the agreement at the termination date of million is reflected as a premium in the carrying value of the senior notes and is being amortized into interest expense over the expected term of the senior notes

notional amounts on interest rate swap and cap agreements are based on contractual terms 
warehouse credit facilities  whole loan purchase facility  securitization notes payable and senior notes principal amounts have been classified based on expected payoff 
notional amounts  which are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contracts  represent average amounts that will be outstanding for each of the years included in the table 
notional amounts do not represent amounts exchanged by parties and  thus  are not a measure of the company s exposure to loss through its use of these agreements 
management monitors the company s hedging activities to ensure that the value of hedges  their correlation to the contracts being hedged and the amounts being hedged continue to provide effective protection against interest rate risk 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s strategies will be effective in minimizing interest rate risk or that increases in interest rates will not have an adverse effect on the company s profitability
