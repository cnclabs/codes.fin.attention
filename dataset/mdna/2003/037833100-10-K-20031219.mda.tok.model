factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the subsection entitled factors that may affect future results and financial condition below 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this form k 
all information presented herein is based on the company s fiscal calendar 
the company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements for any reason  except as required by law 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles and the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations requires the company s management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
management believes the following to be critical accounting policies 
that is  they are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of products ie  hardware  software  and peripherals  and extended warranty and support contracts 
the company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards  including statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended  and securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped  and title and risk of loss have been transferred 
for most of the company s product sales  these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped 
for online sales to individuals  for some sales to education customers in the united states  and for certain other sales  the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit 
if at the outset of an arrangement the company determines the arrangement fee is not  or is presumed to not be  fixed and determinable  revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable 
the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs  including reseller and end user rebates  and other sales programs and volume based incentives 
the estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the company has sold the product and committed to a plan 
the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company s historical experience 
future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions of revenue at the time such programs are offered 
additionally  certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs 
if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives  the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company distributes its products through third party resellers and directly to certain education  consumer  and commercial customers 
the company generally does not require collateral from its customers 
however  when possible the company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in latin america  europe and asia and by arranging with third party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the company s direct customers 
these credit financing arrangements are directly between the third party financing company and the end customer 
as such  the company does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements 
however  considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral  third party flooring arrangements  or credit insurance are outstanding with the company s distribution and retail channel partners 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers 
the company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible 
the company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts  the general economic environment  the financial condition of the company s distribution channels  and the aging of such receivables 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s financial condition  if the company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer  or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated  the company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts  which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made 
inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments 
the company records a write down for inventories of components and products  including third party products held for resale  which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value 
the company performs a detailed review of inventory each period that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts  product lifecycle status  product development plans  current sales levels  and component cost trends 
the personal computer industry is subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes 
if future demand or market conditions for the company s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory  the company may be required to record additional write downs which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write downs are recorded 
the company accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled 
consistent with industry practice  the company acquires components through a combination of formal purchase orders  supplier contracts  and open orders based on projected demand information 
these commitments typically cover the company s requirements for periods ranging from to days 
if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company s products  the company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are identified 
valuation of long lived assets including acquired intangibles the company reviews property  plant  and equipment and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value 
although the company has recognized no material impairment adjustments related to its property  plant  and equipment or identifiable intangibles during the past three fiscal years  except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions  deterioration in the company s business in a geographic region or business segment in the future  including deterioration in the performance of individual retail stores  could lead to such impairment adjustments in the future periods in which such business issues are identified 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in the first quarter of fiscal as a result  the company no longer amortizes goodwill but instead performs a review of goodwill for impairment annually  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the review of goodwill for potential impairment is highly subjective and requires that goodwill be allocated to various reporting units of the company s business to which it relates  the company estimate the fair value of those reporting units to which the goodwill relates  and the company determine the book value of those reporting units 
if the estimated fair value of reporting units with allocated goodwill is determined to be less than their book value  the company is required to estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of those reporting units in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business 
this requires independent valuation of certain internally developed and unrecognized assets including in process research and development and developed technology 
once this process is complete  the amount of goodwill impairment  if any  can be determined 
based on the company s estimates as of september   there was no impairment of goodwill 
however  changes in various circumstances including changes in the company s market capitalization  changes in the company s forecasts  and changes in the company s internal business structure could cause one or more of the company s reporting units to be valued differently thereby causing an impairment of goodwill 
additionally  in response to changes in the personal computer industry and changes in global or regional economic conditions  the company may strategically realign its resources and consider restructuring  disposing  or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of property  plant  and equipment  identifiable intangibles  or goodwill 
warranty costs the company provides currently for the estimated cost for product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical experience of failure rates 
each quarter  the company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary 
if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could negatively affect the company s results of operations 
income taxes the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 
management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income  including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies  together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities  will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets 
in the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
similarly  if the company subsequently realizes deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable  the respective valuation allowance would be reversed  resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the company s results of operations and financial position

certain net sales in and related to recent acquisitions and internet services have been reclassified from other segments net sales to americas segment net sales to conform to the presentation 
b power macintosh figures include server sales 
c net sales of peripherals and other hardware include sales of ipod  apple branded and third party displays  and other hardware accessories 
d net sales of software include sales of apple branded operating system and application software and sales of third party software 
e net sales per macintosh unit sold is derived by dividing total macintosh net sales by total macintosh unit sales 
fiscal year versus net sales increased million or during compared to while macintosh unit sales declined year over year to approximately million units in several factors have contributed favorably to net sales during including the retail segment s net sales grew to million during from million in  an increase of 
while the company s customers may elect to purchase product from their local apple retail store rather than through other preexisting sales channels in the united states  the company believes that a substantial portion of the retail segment s net sales is incremental to total net sales 
see additional comments below related to the retail segment under the heading segment operating performance 
net sales of peripherals and other hardware rose million or during compared  which follows a million or increase in as compared to the current year increase was primarily driven by the million  or  year over year increase in ipod net sales to million 
all of the company s operating segments experienced substantial increases in ipod net sales and unit sales during ipod sales during were favorably affected by the introduction of substantially redesigned new models  which are compatible with both macintosh and windows operating systems and by the company s introduction of its itunes music store for the macintosh operating system in april the company s ipod digital music player is sold by a variety of resellers  many of which do not currently market the company s macintosh systems 
the company has expanded this distribution network during  which has contributed to the current year increase in ipod unit sales of 
in addition to the ipod  the increase in net sales of peripherals and other hardware during also reflects an overall increase in net sales of other computer accessories including airport cards and base stations  which facilitate wireless connectivity  third party digital cameras and printers  and a number of portable computer related accessories 
although total macintosh unit sales were down in  unit sales of the company s portable systems were relatively strong primarily due to the or  unit increase in powerbook unit sales  slightly offset by a or  unit decrease in ibook unit sales 
the increase in powerbook net sales of million or is due primarily to the success of the company s new inch  inch and inch models that were introduced during the decline in ibook consumer portable sales during is primarily due to a lower average price per unit 
portable systems represented of all macintosh systems sold in versus in and in  which reflects an overall industry trend towards portable systems 
the company s average net sales per macintosh unit sold increased to  in as a result of various changes in overall unit mix towards relatively higher priced powerbook systems and an increase in direct sales primarily from the company s retail and online stores  offset by somewhat lower year over year pricing on comparable macintosh systems for most of the company s macintosh product lines in response to industry pricing pressure  particularly with the company s ibook consumer portable systems 
powerbook and power macintosh systems accounted for of total unit sales in versus in net sales of software increased million or during compared to the prior year and reflects higher net sales of apple branded application and server software and third party software 
net sales of apple branded application and server software increased due to the introduction of several new software titles during the year including final cut express  ilife  and keynote  as well as from higher sales of software related to recent acquisitions including powerschool and emagic 
growth in net sales of third party software during was particularly strong in the americas segment due to strong sales of software by the company s online store and its retail segment 
service and other sales rose million or during and results from significant year over year increases in net sales associated with applecare protection plan app extended maintenance and support services  as well as the company s internet related services 
increased net sales associated with app are primarily the result of increasing attach rates over the last several years 
increased net sales associated with internet services are due to net sales from the itunes music store introduced in april and increased net sales of the company s 
mac internet service 
offsetting the favorable factors discussed above  the company s net sales during were negatively impacted by the following factors total unit sales of desktop systems fell during compared to imac systems unit sales declined from to resulting from a shift in sales away from desktop systems in favor of portables 
also  the current flat panel imac form factor was in the eighth quarter of its life cycle by the end of and did not experience significant enhancements until the release of the inch flat panel imac in november unit sales of power macintosh systems fell during compared to for the first nine months of compared to the same period in  unit sales of power macintosh systems decreased  which is representative of the decline of power macintosh systems sales experienced by the company during recent years and is also believed to be attributable to delays in purchasing pending the release of the power mac g as expected  this trend reversed in the fourth quarter of with unit sales increasing during the quarter as compared to the same period in the prior year due largely to the new power mac g  which the company introduced in june and began shipping at the end of fiscal the decline in power macintosh sales over the last several years also reflects the shift in sales to portable systems  particularly powerbooks 
in addition  the company continues to believe that weak economic conditions over the past several years are having a pronounced negative impact on its professional and creative customers 
additionally  some of the company s professional and creative customers may have delayed upgrades of their systems in anticipation of certain software vendors transitioning their professionally oriented macintosh software applications to run natively on mac os x 
currently there are many applications that run natively on mac os x  including adobe s photoshop and quarkxpress  however  there is no assurance that this will result in additional sales of macintosh systems  particularly power macintosh units 
the company has continued to experience ongoing weakness in its us education channel during net sales and unit sales in us education during were down and  respectively  as compared to this decline was due to a decrease in k sales  partially offset by an increase in higher education sales 
net sales declined primarily as a result of a continued shift in mix away from higher priced power macintosh and imac systems towards lower priced emac and ibook systems  although the company did experience a significant increase in sales of its powerbook systems primarily to higher education customers 
portable systems accounted for approximately of total unit sales in the education channel during  as compared to approximately in the company s one to one learning solutions are a complete solution consisting of an ibook portable system for every student and teacher along with a wireless network connected to a central server 
the company has experienced significant competition in learning solutions and  accordingly  has experienced a lower sales price per unit  on average  in these transactions 
the company believes weakness in its us education channel  particularly k  has been caused by multiple factors including funding pressures due to weak economic conditions  large budget deficits in many states  and increased competition particularly for desktop computers 
although the company has taken steps  and will continue to take steps  to address weakness in the us education channel  it remains difficult to anticipate when and if this negative trend will reverse 
the personal computer industry in general  and the company specifically  continue to see relatively soft demand for their products 
sales of professional and consumer oriented macintosh systems remain far below levels experienced in fiscal and earlier 
difficult global economic conditions during the past several years exacerbated by the economic and political uncertainties caused by terrorist activities and the associated international responses have clearly had a pronounced negative effect on the overall demand for the company s products in virtually all of its markets 
further  growth in the overall personal computer industry has slowed due to the high market penetration of personal computers and a lengthening of consumer  creative  and business personal computer upgrade cycles 
fiscal year versus net sales increased million or during compared to  while macintosh unit sales were relatively flat year over year at approximately million units 
on a geographic basis  performance in the domestic market was relatively strong  especially when considering the performance of the company s retail segment  which operated during exclusively in the united states 
however  the european and japanese markets remained sluggish throughout the company s net sales in were positively influenced by a number of factors 
first  net sales from software  service  peripherals  and other sources rose million or in versus this increase was driven by several factors including a increase in combined third party and apple branded software sales  million in net sales of ipod  the company s portable digital music player that was introduced in the first half of  a increase in the sale of computer accessories  and a increase in service revenue caused primarily by increased revenue associated with extended maintenance and support contracts 
the growth in software revenue was primarily the result of increased sales of third party software in the company s retail and online stores and expansion in recent years in the number of apple branded software titles 
second  overall unit sales of macintosh portable systems grew by  units or in reflecting a general trend in the personal computer market away from desktop systems towards portable systems 
during  portable macintosh systems represented of total systems sales versus in and in growth in this area has been most pronounced for ibook  the company s education and consumer oriented portable macintosh system 
ibook unit sales increased in and in third  the company s retail segment grew from stores at the end of to stores at the end of the retail segment s net sales grew from million in to million in while the retail segment may have cannibalized some net sales from the company s preexisting sales channels in the us  the company believed that a substantial portion of the retail segment s net sales was incremental to the company s total net sales 
see additional comments below related to the retail segment under the heading segment operating performance 
fourth  the company s average unit pricing increased during as a result of various changes in overall unit mix offset by somewhat lower pricing year over year on comparative macintosh systems 
net sales per macintosh unit sold during of  per unit reflected the shift in mix towards relatively higher priced portable macintosh systems and reflected the impact on net sales of the relatively higher priced new imac design introduced during the impact of these changes in mix were offset by the decline in unit sales of relatively higher priced power macintosh systems and by lower pricing on comparative macintosh systems during for most of the company s macintosh product lines in response to industry pricing pressure 
fifth  any comparison of net sales in versus must consider the effect of unusually low net sales during the first quarter of this was attributable to several factors at the beginning of  including continued deterioration in worldwide demand for personal computers  rebate programs and price cuts instituted by the company during that quarter that cost the company approximately million  and a plan implemented by the company during the first quarter of that reduced substantially the level of inventory in its distribution channels that resulted in a decline in channel inventory of approximately  units during that quarter 
offsetting the favorable factors discussed above  the company s net sales in were negatively impacted by several notable factors 
first  unit sales of power macintosh systems fell during as compared to this followed a decline in power macintosh unit sales in from the company believed that weak economic conditions over the past several years had a pronounced negative impact on its professional and creative customers and that many of these customers continued to delay upgrades of their power macintosh systems due to the company s ongoing transition to mac os x  its new operating system  and in anticipation of certain software vendors transitioning their macintosh applications to run natively in mac os x 
further  the company did not experience the anticipated increase in power macintosh sales that it expected following the introduction of adobe s photoshop during additionally  many professional users may have postponed upgrading their systems until after the introduction of mac os x jaguar released in the fourth quarter of others may have delayed upgrading until after the availability of other professionally oriented software applications for mac os x such as quarkxpress 
second  despite the overall increase in net sales during in the americas  the company continued to see weakness in its us education channel 
total net sales in this channel fell in and in these declines were consistent with industry data that showed the company losing market share in the us education market in each of the last two fiscal years 
the company believed this weakness was caused by multiple factors  including increased price competition in this price sensitive market from the company s competitors who sell windows based personal computers 
additionally  some of the company s education customers appeared to be delaying technology purchases due to concerns about the overall impact of the weaker economy on their available funding 
third  the personal computer industry in general and the company specifically experienced soft demand for its products due to adverse global economic conditions  political uncertainties  and a lengthening of consumer  creative  and business personal computer upgrade cycles 
segment operating performance the company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis 
the company s reportable operating segments are comprised of the americas  europe  japan  and retail 
the americas segment includes both north and south america  except for the activities of the company s retail segment 
the europe segment includes european countries as well as the middle east and africa 
the japan segment includes only japan  except for the activities of the company s retail segment 
the retail segment currently operates apple owned retail stores in the united states and opened its first international store in tokyo  japan in the first quarter of each reportable operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services 
further information regarding the company s operating segments may be found in item of this form k in the notes to consolidated financial statements at note  segment information and geographic data 
americas net sales in the americas segment during increased million or compared to during and  the americas segment represented approximately and  respectively  of the company s total net sales and represented approximately and  respectively  of total macintosh unit sales 
the results of the americas segment are similar to the overall results of the company as they reflect substantially lower unit sales and net sales of power macintosh systems and imac systems  partially offset by increases in unit sales and net sales of powerbooks 
the net sales of the americas segment  and the company in total  also reflect substantially higher sales of peripherals  software  and services during compared to due primarily to higher sales of ipods and internet services 
the americas segment has been negatively affected by weakness in its us education channel 
as noted above  total net sales and unit sales in the us education channel during were down and  respectively  compared to the same period in the company believes this decline is caused by increased competition in the education market and by a reduction in spending by us educational institutions due to federal and state funding concerns and tax revenue shortfalls resulting from the weak economy 
additionally  some of the decline during in net sales and unit sales of macintosh systems in the americas segment may be the result of the operation of the company s retail segment whose net sales  all of which occurred within the us  increased significantly during net sales for the americas segment increased or million in compared to the americas segment was negatively affected by a decline in us education sales in of million 
the americas segment also experienced a decline in power macintosh unit sales 
however  outside of the us education channel  unit sales of consumer desktop and portable systems rebounded from the substantial declines experienced in  rising a combined in sales of software  peripherals  and accessories were also up in the americas during growth in unit sales of consumer oriented systems during in the americas is somewhat attributable to the significantly depressed level of net sales experienced in the first quarter of as discussed above 
however  growth in the americas was somewhat negatively affected  particularly with respect to consumer oriented systems  by the significant growth of the company s retail segment in the us more than of the retail segment s macintosh unit sales during were for imacs and ibooks 
europe net sales in europe increased million or during as compared to while macintosh unit sales declined by during the same period 
europe s operating results were consistent with the trend experienced in the americas and by the company as a whole 
europe experienced weakened demand for power macintosh  imac and ibook systems in  partially offset by strong demand for powerbooks whose net sales increased by or million from europe also realized increased sales of peripherals  software  and service  primarily attributable to higher sales of ipods  accessories and app 
economic conditions in europe remained weak throughout  and the overall demand for the company s products in that region remained flat during versus unit sales in europe for reflect relatively stronger demand for consumer oriented products  particularly ibook whose unit sales increased in  offset by declines in power macintosh unit sales 
japan net sales in japan decreased million or during as compared to the same period in  the weakest year to date performance of any of the company s operating segments 
japan s macintosh unit sales were particularly weak in  declining  and were primarily attributable to lower sales of imac and ibook systems  partially offset by an increase in powerbook sales as well as higher sales of peripherals and other hardware 
japan s macintosh unit sales remain significantly below the segment s historic levels due to current economic conditions that remain particularly negative in japan 
net sales in japan remained flat during versus  with a slight decline in unit sales of 
consistent with the company s other geographic operating segments  during japan showed growth in unit sales of consumer systems and a decline in unit sales of power macintosh systems 
japan s imac unit sales increased in however  in the case of japan the increase in imac unit shipments in versus was primarily the result of the unusually depressed level of net sales experienced by the company in the first quarter of as discussed above 
additionally  net sales in japan on a sequential and year over year comparative basis generally worsened as progressed reflecting particularly poor economic conditions in japan 
retail the company opened new retail stores during  bringing the total number of open stores to as of september   which compares to open stores as of september  and open stores as of september  during the first quarter of fiscal  the company opened additional stores including its first international store in the ginza in tokyo  japan 
the retail segment s net sales grew to million during from million in and from million in the million or increase in net sales during reflects the impact from opening new stores in  the full year impact of store openings  as well as an increase in average revenue per store 
total macintosh sales increased by approximately million of which million related to year over year increases in powerbook sales 
the retail segment has also contributed strongly to the increases in net sales of peripherals  software and services experienced by the company during during  approximately of the retail segment s net sales came from the sale of apple branded and third party peripherals  software and services as compared to for the company as a whole 
with an average of stores open during  the retail segment achieved annualized revenue per store of approximately million  as compared to approximately million based on an average of stores open in as measured by the company s operating segment reporting  the retail segment improved from a loss of million during to a loss of million during this improvement is primarily attributable to the segment s year over year increase in net sales  which resulted in higher leverage on occupancy  depreciation and other fixed costs 
expansion of the retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure  operating lease commitments  personnel  and other operating expenses 
capital expenditures associated with the retail segment since its inception totaled approximately million through the end of fiscal  million of which was incurred during as of september   the retail segment had approximately  employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of million 
the company would incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate its retail segment or close individual stores 
such costs could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
investment in a new business model such as the retail segment is inherently risky  particularly in light of the significant investment involved  the current economic climate  and the fixed nature of a substantial portion of the retail segment s operating expenses 
gross margin gross margin for the three fiscal years ended september  are as follows in millions  except gross margin percentages net sales    cost of sales    gross margin    gross margin percentage gross margin decreased to of net sales in from of net sales in this decline in gross margin reflects relatively aggressive pricing actions on several macintosh models instituted by the company beginning in late fiscal as a result of continued pricing pressure throughout the personal computer industry  lower sales of relatively higher margin power macintosh systems during the first three fiscal quarters of  and increased air freight and manufacturing costs associated with the production ramp up of the new power mac g and inch powerbook  both of which began shipping in volume during september this decline is also attributable to a rise in certain component costs as the year progressed 
the aforementioned negative factors affecting gross margins during were partially offset by the increase in higher margin software and direct sales 
the company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margin of the overall personal computer industry will remain under pressure throughout fiscal in light of weak economic conditions  price competition in the personal computer industry  and potential increases in component pricing 
the company also expects to continue to incur air freight charges on the power mac g and other products during the foregoing statements regarding the company s expected gross margin during  general demand for personal computers  anticipated industry component pricing  anticipated air freight charges  and future economic conditions are forward looking 
there can be no assurance that current gross margins will be maintained  targeted gross margin levels will be achieved  or current margins on existing individual products will be maintained 
in general  gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors  including continued industry wide global pricing pressures  increased competition  compressed product life cycles  potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services  and potential changes to the company s product mix  including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins 
in response to these downward pressures  the company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products 
gross margins could also be affected by the company s ability to effectively manage product quality and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products 
the company s operating strategy and pricing take into account anticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates over time  however  the company s results of operations can be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in exchange rates 
the company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments 
because the company s markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes  there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components 
the company s operating results and financial condition in the past have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the company s ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments and to respond to short term shifts in customer demand patterns 
gross margin increased to of net sales in from in gross margin in was unusually low resulting from negative gross margin of experienced in the first quarter of as a percentage of net sales  the company s quarterly gross margins declined during fiscal from in the first quarter down to in the fourth quarter 
this decline resulted from several factors including a rise in component costs as the year progressed and aggressive pricing by the company across its products lines instituted as a result of continued pricing pressures in the personal computer industry 
operating expenses operating expenses for the three fiscal years ended september  are as follows in millions  except for percentages research and development percentage of net sales selling  general  and administrative expenses    percentage of net sales restructuring costs purchased in process research and development research and development r d the company recognizes that focused investments in r d are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the company s core business strategy 
the company has historically relied upon innovation to remain competitive 
r d expense amounted to approximately of total net sales during  and  up substantially from approximately of total net sales in fiscal year and recent earlier periods 
the company s management believes that maintaining or increasing the pace of innovation and product development is the best way to respond to current economic and market conditions and will continue to position the company for future growth as conditions improve 
r d expense increased or million to million in as compared to  which follows a million increase in as compared to the overall increase in r d expense relates primarily to increased headcount and support for new product development activities 
r d spending also included capitalized software development costs of approximately million related to the development of mac os x panther in  approximately million associated with the development of mac os x jaguar and approximately million associated with the powerschool enterprise student information system in  and approximately million associated with the development of the original version of mac os x in further information related to the company s capitalization of software development costs may be found in part ii  item of this form k at note of notes to consolidated financial statements

accounting for stock based compensation the company currently measures compensation expense for its employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and provides pro forma disclosures of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense 
the company has elected to follow apb opinion no 
because  as further discussed in part ii  item of this form k at note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the alternative fair value accounting provided for under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
under apb opinion no 
 when the exercise price of the company s employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant  no compensation expense is recognized 
the fasb decided on april  to require all companies to expense the value of employee stock options 
companies will be required to measure the cost of employee stock options according to their fair value 
the fasb has indicated that it plans to issue in the first quarter of calendar year an exposure draft of a new accounting standard addressing this matter 
prior to issuance of this exposure draft  the fasb has indicated it will be addressing several significant technical issues 
among other things  the fasb must determine the extent to which the new accounting standard will permit adjustments to recognized expense for actual option forfeitures and actual performance outcomes 
this determination will affect the timing and amount of compensation expense recognized 
also  a method to determine the fair value of employee stock options must be established 
current accounting standards require use of an option pricing model  such as the black scholes formula  to determine fair value and provide guidance on adjusting some of the input factors used in the model 
this valuation approach has received significant criticism and may be subject to changes that could have a significant impact on the calculated fair value of employee stock options under the new standard 
at the company s annual shareholder s meeting on april   shareholders approved a proposal requesting that the company s board of directors the board establish a policy of expensing the value of all future employee stock options issued by the company 
the board and management appreciate and take seriously the views expressed by the company s shareholders 
as discussed in the company s form q for the period ended march   the company had decided not to expense the value of employee stock options until the fasb finalizes its new accounting standard on the matter 
the company based this decision on the fasb s announced intention to soon require all companies to expense the value of employee stock options and the fasb s near term review of technical issues that will play a significant role in determining the fair value of and accounting for employee stock options 
the company monitors progress at the fasb and other developments with respect to the general issue of employee stock compensation 
in the future  should the company expense the value of employee stock options  either out of choice or due to new requirements issued by the fasb  the company may have to recognize substantially more compensation expense in future periods that could have a material adverse impact on the company s future results of operations

as of september   the company s cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments portfolio totaled billion  an increase of million from the end of fiscal the company s short term investment portfolio consists primarily of investments in us treasury and agency securities  us corporate securities  and foreign securities 
foreign securities consist primarily of foreign commercial paper  certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign institutions  most of which are denominated in us dollars 
the company s investments are generally liquid and investment grade 
as a result of declining investment yields on the company s cash equivalents and short term investments resulting from substantially lower market interest rates during  the company has elected to reduce the average maturity of its portfolio to maintain liquidity for future investment opportunities when market interest rates increase 
accordingly  during the company increased its holdings in short term investment grade instruments  both in us corporate and foreign securities  that are classified as cash equivalents and has reduced its holdings in longer term us corporate securities classified as short term investments 
although the company s cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments increased in  the company s working capital at september  decreased by million as compared to the end of fiscal due primarily to the current year reclassification of the company s long term debt as a current obligation resulting from its scheduled maturity in february the primary sources of total cash and cash equivalents in fiscal were million in cash generated by operating activities and million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock  partially offset by million utilized for capital expenditures and million for the repurchase of common stock

stock repurchase plan in july  the company s board of directors authorized a plan for the company to repurchase up to million of its common stock 
this repurchase plan does not obligate the company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time 
during the fourth quarter of  the company entered into a forward purchase agreement to acquire million shares of its common stock in september of at an average price of per share for a total cost of million 
in august  the company settled this agreement prior to its maturity  at which time the company s common stock had a fair value of 
other than this forward purchase transaction  the company has not engaged in any transactions to repurchase its common stock since fiscal since inception of the stock repurchase plan  the company had repurchased a total of million shares at a cost of million 
the company was still authorized to repurchase up to an additional million of its common stock as of september  off balance sheet arrangements the company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the company has financial guarantees  subordinated retained interests  derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the company to material continuing risks  contingent liabilities  or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company 
lease commitments as of september   the company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of approximately million  million of which related to the lease of retail space and related facilities 
remaining terms on the company s existing operating leases range from to years 
subsequent to september   the company entered into additional operating lease commitments for retail space with future lease commitments totaling million for periods ranging from to years 
purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and component suppliers the company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub assemblies for the company s products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products 
these contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the company  which typically covers periods ranging from to months 
the company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers 
consistent with industry practice  the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders  supplier contracts  and open orders based on projected demand information 
such purchase commitments typically cover the company s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from to days 
as of september   the company had outstanding third party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of approximately million 
indemnifications the company generally does not indemnify end users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third party intellectual property rights 
other licensing agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the company or an indemnified third party 
however  the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified third party and  in the opinion of management  does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition because of the following factors  as well as other factors affecting the company s operating results and financial condition  past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
general economic conditions and current economic and political uncertainty could adversely affect the demand for the company s products and the financial health of its suppliers  distributors  and resellers 
the company s operating performance depends significantly on general economic conditions 
for much of the past several years  demand for the company s products has been negatively impacted by difficult global economic conditions 
additionally  some of the company s education customers appear to be delaying technology purchases due to concerns about the overall impact of the weaker economy on their available funding 
continued uncertainty about future economic conditions continues to make it difficult to forecast future operating results 
should global and regional economic conditions fail to improve or continue to deteriorate  demand for the company s products could continue to be adversely affected  as could the financial health of its suppliers  distributors  and resellers 
war  terrorism or public health issues could disrupt supply  delivery or demand of products which could negatively affect the company s operations and performance 
war  terrorism or public health issues  whether in the us or abroad  have caused and could continue to cause damage or disruption to international commerce by creating economic and political uncertainties that may have a strong negative impact on the global economy  the company  and the company s suppliers or customers 
although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events  such events could result in a decrease in demand for the company s products  make it difficult or impossible to deliver products to its customers  or to receive components from its suppliers  and could create delays and inefficiencies in the company s supply chain 
the company s operating results and financial condition have been  and in the future may continue to be  adversely affected by these events 
the company and some of its manufacturing vendors and component suppliers have significant operations in various locations throughout asia  including locations in mainland china  the hong kong special administrative region  and singapore  all of which were subject to the world health organization and centers for disease control and prevention severe acute respiratory syndrome sars travel advisories at times during the second and third quarters of fiscal similar travel advisories were issued for taiwan  where a significant amount of the company s portable macintosh systems and the ipod are assembled 
should the severity of the sars threat increase or other public health issues arise  the company could be negatively impacted by the need for more stringent employee travel restrictions  additional limitations in the availability of freight services  governmental actions limiting the movement of products between various regions  delays in production ramps of new products  and disruptions in the operations of the company s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers 
the market for personal computers and related peripherals and services is highly competitive 
if the company is unable to effectively compete in these markets  its results of operations could be adversely affected 
the personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices  downward pressure on gross margins  frequent introduction of new products  short product life cycles  evolving industry standards  continual improvement in product price performance characteristics  rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors  price sensitivity on the part of consumers  and a large number of competitors 
over the past several years  price competition in the market for personal computers and related peripherals has been particularly intense 
the company s competitors who sell windows based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins in order to gain or maintain market share in response to the weakness in demand that began in the second half of calendar for personal computing products 
the company s results of operations and financial condition have been  and in the future may continue to be  adversely affected by these and other industry wide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins 
the personal computer industry has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality  hardware performance  and features based on existing or emerging industry standards 
further  as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the internet  an increasing number of internet devices that are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the company s existing products 
several competitors of the company have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of the company s key market segments  including consumer  education  professional and consumer digital video editing  and design and publishing 
several of the company s competitors have introduced or announced plans to introduce digital music products that mimic many of the unique design  technical features  and solutions of the company s products 
the company has a significant number of competitors  many of whom have greater financial  marketing  manufacturing  and technological resources  as well as broader product lines and larger installed customer bases than those of the company 
additionally  there has been a trend towards consolidation in the personal computer industry that has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors in the company s markets 
the company is currently the only maker of hardware using the mac os 
the mac os has a minority market share in the personal computer market  which is dominated by makers of computers utilizing microsoft s windows operating systems 
the company s future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived design and functional advantages over competing platforms  including windows 
the company is currently focused on market opportunities related to digital music distribution and related consumer electronic devices including ipods 
the company faces increasing competition from other companies promoting their own digital music distribution services  free peer to peer music services  emerging companies  and larger companies that may have greater resources  including technical and marketing resources  and supplier relationships 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to provide products and services that effectively compete in these markets 
failure to effectively compete could negatively affect the company s operating results and financial position 
the company has higher research and development and selling  general and administrative costs  as a percentage of revenue  than many of its competitors 
the company s ability to compete successfully and maintain attractive gross margins is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of innovative and competitive products and technologies to the marketplace 
as a result  the company incurs higher research and development costs as a percentage of revenue than its competitors who sell personal computers based on other operating systems 
many of these competitors seek to compete aggressively on price and maintain very low cost structures 
further  as a result of the expansion of the company s retail segment and costs associated with marketing the company s brand including its unique operating system  the company incurs higher selling costs as a percentage of revenue than many of its competitors 
if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive gross margins  its results of operations may be materially adversely affected by its operating cost structure 
the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions in order to remain competitive and effectively stimulate customer demand 
due to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry  which is characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances  the company must continually introduce new products and technologies  enhance existing products in order to remain competitive  and effectively stimulate customer demand for new products and upgraded versions of the company s existing products 
the success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors  including market acceptance  the company s ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions  including production ramp issues  the availability of application software for new products  the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand  the availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand  and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction 
accordingly  the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations 
during  the company introduced a new client operating system  mac os x  and delivered its first major upgrade  mac os x version other major upgrades include mac os x jaguar in and most recently mac os x panther in october inability of the company to provide additional improvements in the performance and functionality of mac os x  advance customer acceptance of the new operating system and its upgrades  obtain the continued commitment of software developers to transition existing applications to run on mac os x  or create new applications to run on mac os x  may have an adverse impact on the company s operating results and financial condition 
because orders for components  and in some cases commitments to purchase components  must be placed in advance of customer orders  the company faces substantial inventory risk 
the company records a write down for inventories of components and products that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have been cancelled 
although the company believes its inventory and related provisions are adequate  given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer industry  no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional inventory and related charges 
in addition  such charges have had  and may have  a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments 
because the company s markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes  there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products 
consistent with industry practice  components are normally acquired through a combination of formal purchase orders  supplier contracts  and open orders based on projected demand information 
such purchase commitments typically cover the company s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from to days 
the company s operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the company s ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short term shifts in customer demand patterns 
future operating results are dependent upon the company s ability to obtain a sufficient supply of components  some of which are in short supply or available only from limited sources 
although most components essential to the company s business are generally available from multiple sources  certain key components including microprocessors and asics are currently obtained by the company from single or limited sources 
some key components including without limitation dram  tft lcd flat panel displays  and optical and magnetic disk drives  while currently available to the company from multiple sources  are at times subject to industry wide availability and pricing pressures 
in addition  new products introduced by the company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the company has evaluated whether there is a need for  and subsequently qualifies  additional suppliers 
in situations where a component or product utilizes new technologies  initial capacity constraints may exist until such time as the suppliers yields have matured 
the company and other producers in the personal computer industry also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products 
the company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry including certain microprocessors and asics 
continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of components other than those customized to meet the company s requirements 
if the supply of a key component were to be delayed or constrained on a new or existing product  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the company s ability to produce and market competitive products is also dependent on the ability and desire of ibm and motorola  the sole suppliers of the powerpc risc based microprocessor for the company s macintosh computers  to provide the company with a sufficient supply of microprocessors with price performance features that compare favorably to those supplied to the company s competitors by intel corporation and other developers and producers of microprocessors used by personal computers using other operating systems 
further  despite its efforts to educate the marketplace to the contrary  the company believes that many of its current and potential customers believe that the relatively slower mhz rating or clock speed of the microprocessors it utilizes in its macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by other operating systems and translates to slower overall system performance 
there have been instances in recent years where the inability of the company s suppliers to provide advanced powerpc g and g microprocessors with higher clock speeds in sufficient quantity has had significant adverse effects on the company s results of operations 
in addition  currently ibm is the company s sole supplier of the g processor used in current power macintosh products and motorola is the sole supplier of the g processors 
the inability in the future of the company to obtain microprocessors in sufficient quantities with competitive price performance features could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company relies on third party music content  which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the company contracts with third parties to offer their music content to customers through the company s itunes music store 
the company pays substantial fees to obtain the rights to offer to its customers this third party music 
many of the company s licensing arrangements with these third party content providers are short term in nature and do not guarantee the future renewal of these arrangements at commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
certain parties in the music industry have announced their intent to consolidate their music distribution operations  which could limit the availability and increase the fees required to offer music content to customers through the itunes music store 
if the company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of music content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules  or expand its geographic reach outside the united states  then sales and gross margins of the company s itunes music store as well as related hardware and peripherals  including ipods  may be adversely affected 
third party content providers and artists require that the company provide certain digital rights management solutions and other security mechanisms 
if the requirements from content providers or artists change  then the company may be required to further develop or license technology to address such new rights and requirements 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner  if at all  which could have a materially adverse affect on the company s operating results and financial position 
the company is dependent on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties  many of whom are located outside of the united states 
many of the company s products are manufactured in whole or in part by third party manufacturers 
in addition  the company has outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management 
while outsourcing arrangements may lower the fixed cost of operations  they also reduce the company s direct control over production and distribution 
it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured  or the flexibility of the company to respond to changing market conditions 
moreover  although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement  the company may remain at least initially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects 
any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability  whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise  could adversely affect the company s future operating results and financial condition 
final assembly of products sold by the company is conducted in the company s manufacturing facilities in sacramento  california  and cork  ireland  and by external vendors in fremont  california  fullerton  california  taiwan  korea  the netherlands  the people s republic of china  and the czech republic 
currently  manufacture of many of the components used in the company s products and final assembly of substantially all of the company s portable products including powerbooks  ibooks  and the ipod is performed by third party vendors in japan  taiwan and china 
if for any reason manufacturing or logistics in any of these locations is disrupted by regional economic  business  environmental  medical  political  or military conditions or events  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the company s products  from time to time  experience quality problems that can result in decreased net sales and operating profits 
the company sells highly complex hardware and software products that can contain defects in design and manufacture 
sophisticated operating system software and applications  such as those sold by the company  often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software 
defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties that may be beyond its control 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware and software it sells 
failure to do so could result in lost revenue  loss of reputation  and significant expense to remedy 
the company s retail initiative has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
through november  the company has opened retail stores including its first international store in tokyo  japan 
the company s retail initiative has required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements  information systems  inventory  and personnel 
the company has also entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space with lease terms ranging from to years 
the company could incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate this initiative or close individual stores 
such costs could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  a relatively high proportion of the retail segment s costs are fixed because of depreciation on store construction costs and lease expense 
as a result  significant losses would result should the retail segment experience a decline in sales for any reason 
certain of the company s stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues that function as vehicles for general corporate marketing  corporate events  and brand awareness 
because of their unique design elements  locations and size  these stores require substantially more investment in equipment and leasehold improvements than the company s more typical retail stores 
the company has opened four such stores and has one under construction 
because of their location and size  these high profile stores also require the company to enter into substantially larger operating lease commitments compared to those required for its more typical stores 
current leases on such locations have terms ranging from to years with total commitments per location over the lease terms ranging from million to million 
closure or poor performance of one of these high profile stores could have a particularly significant negative impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
many of the general risks and uncertainties the company faces could also have an adverse impact on its retail segment 
also  many factors unique to retail operations present risks and uncertainties  some of which are beyond the company s control  that could adversely affect the retail segment s future results  cause its actual results to differ from those currently expected  and or have an adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations 
potential risks and uncertainties unique to retail operations that could have an adverse impact on the retail segment include  among other things  macro economic factors that have a negative impact on general retail activity  inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation  lack of consumer acceptance of the company s retail approach  failure to attract new users to the macintosh platform  inability to sell third party hardware and software products at adequate margins  failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel partners  lack of experience in managing retail operations outside the united states  costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of apple branded and third party retail inventory  and inability to obtain quality retail locations at reasonable cost 
unit sales of the company s professionally oriented desktop systems have declined sharply over the past several years negatively impacting net sales and gross margin 
unit sales of power macintosh systems fell during as compared to and fell in from power macintosh unit sales have fallen as a percentage of total macintosh unit sales from in to in the company believes that weak economic conditions over the past several years are having a pronounced negative impact on its professional and creative customers who are the primary users of such systems 
also  it is likely that many of the company s current and potential customers  particularly professional and creative customers who are most likely to utilize the company s power macintosh systems  believe that the relatively slower mhz rating or clock speed of the microprocessors it utilizes in its macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by other operating systems and translates to slower overall system performance 
in addition to the negative impact on net sales  declining sales of power macintosh systems also have a negative effect on the company s overall gross margin because power macintosh systems generally have higher individual gross margins than the company s other macintosh systems 
continued deterioration in power macintosh unit sales could adversely affect the company s future net sales and gross margin 
if future unit sales of power macintosh systems fail to partially or fully recover  it will be difficult for the company to improve its overall profitability 
while the company has introduced faster power macintosh systems utilizing bit powerpc g processors during  there can be no assurance that introduction of such systems will favorably impact net sales either in the short or long term 
the company faces increasing competition in the us education market 
sales in the united states to both elementary and secondary schools  as well as for college and university customers  remain a core market for apple 
net sales in these markets fell to of the company s total net sales in from and in and  respectively 
the drop in reflects declines in both net sales and macintosh unit sales in these markets of and  respectively  in fiscal compared to additionally  several competitors of the company have either targeted or announced their intention to target the education market for personal computers  which could also negatively affect the company s market share 
in an effort to regain market share and remain competitive  the company has been and will continue to pursue learning solutions in education 
these solutions and other strategic sales are generally priced more aggressively and could result in significantly less profitability or even in financial losses  particularly for larger deals 
although the company believes it has taken certain steps to strengthen its position in the education market  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase or maintain its share of the education market or execute profitably on large strategic arrangements 
failure to do so may have an adverse impact on the company s operating results and financial condition 
the company s future operating performance is dependent on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the company s products 
the company distributes its products through wholesalers  resellers  national and regional retailers and cataloguers  many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers 
in addition  the company also sells many of its products and resells certain third party products in most of its major markets directly to end users  certain education customers  and certain resellers through its online stores around the world 
the company also sells its own products and certain third party products through its retail stores 
many of the company s significant resellers operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by current economic conditions 
considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with the company s distribution and retail channel partners 
the company s business and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weaken  if resellers within consumer channels were to cease distribution of the company s products  or if uncertainty regarding demand for the company s products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company s products 
the company has invested and will continue to invest in various programs to enhance reseller sales  including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees 
these programs could require a substantial investment from the company  while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue to offset this investment 
over the past several years  an increasing proportion of the company s net sales have been made by the company directly to end users through its online stores around the world and through its retail stores in the united states 
some of the company s resellers have perceived this expansion of the company s direct sales as conflicting with their own business and economic interests as distributors and resellers of the company s products 
perception of such a conflict could discourage the company s resellers from investing additional resources in the distribution and sale of the company s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of the company s products 
the company s business and financial results could be adversely affected if expansion of its direct sales to end users causes some or all of its resellers to cease or limit distribution of the company s products 
further information regarding risks associated with marketing and distribution may be found in part i  item of this form k under the heading markets and distribution  which information is hereby incorporated by reference 
the company s business is subject to the risks of international operations 
a large portion of the company s revenue is derived from its international operations 
as a result  the company s operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities  including economic and labor conditions  political instability  tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries  and changes in the value of the us dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are purchased 
the company s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non dollar denominated sales in europe  japan  australia  canada  and certain parts of asia and non dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world 
weaknesses in foreign currencies  particularly the japanese yen and the euro  can adversely impact consumer demand for the company s products and the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales 
conversely  strengthening in these and other foreign currencies can increase the cost to the company of product components  negatively affecting the company s results of operations 
margins on sales of apple products in foreign countries  and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers  can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations  including tariffs and antidumping penalties 
derivative instruments  such as foreign exchange forward and option positions  and interest rate swap and option positions have been utilized by the company to hedge exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the use of such hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates 
further information related to the company s global market risks may be found in part ii  item a of this form k under the subheading foreign currency risk and may be found in part ii  item of this form k at notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements  which information is hereby incorporated by reference 
the company s future performance is dependent upon support from third party software developers 
if third party software applications cease to be developed or available for the company s hardware products  then customers may choose not to buy the company s products 
the company believes that decisions by customers to purchase the company s personal computers  as opposed to windows based systems  are often based on the availability of third party software for particular applications such as microsoft office 
the company also believes the availability of third party application software for the company s hardware products depends in part on third party developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing  maintaining  and upgrading such software for the company s products versus software for the larger windows market 
this analysis is based on factors such as the perceived strength of the company and its products  the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated  acceptance by customers of mac os x  and the costs of developing such software products 
to the extent the company s financial losses in prior years and the minority market share held by the company in the personal computer market  as well as the company s decision to end its mac os licensing program  have caused software developers to question the company s prospects in the personal computer market  developers could be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software for the company s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market 
moreover  there can be no assurance software developers will continue to develop software for mac os x  the company s operating system  on a timely basis or at all 
in addition  past and future development by the company of its own software applications and solutions may negatively impact the decision of software developers to develop  maintain  and upgrade similar or competitive software for the company s products 
the company currently markets and sells a variety of software applications for use by professionals  consumers  and education customers that could influence the decision of third party software developers to develop or upgrade macintosh compatible software products 
software applications currently marketed by the company include software for professional film and video editing  professional compositing and visual effects for large format film and video productions  professional music production and music post production  professional and consumer dvd encoding and authoring  consumer digital video and digital photo editing and management  digital music management  desktop based database management  and high quality presentations 
the company also markets an integrated productivity application that incorporates word processing  page layout  image manipulation  spreadsheets  databases  and presentations in a single application 
in august  the company and microsoft corporation entered into patent cross license and technology agreements 
in addition  for a period of five years through august  and subject to certain limitations related to the number of macintosh computers sold by the company  microsoft was required to make versions of its microsoft office and internet explorer products for the mac os 
although microsoft has released microsoft office and internet explorer for mac os x  microsoft is not obligated to produce future versions of its products subsequent to august while the company believes its relationship with microsoft has been and will continue to be beneficial to the company and to its efforts to increase the installed base for the mac os  the company does compete directly with microsoft in a number of key areas 
accordingly  microsoft s interest in producing application software for the mac os following expiration of the agreements may be influenced by microsoft s perception of its interests as the vendor of the windows operating system 
discontinuance of microsoft office and other microsoft products for the macintosh platform would have an adverse effect on the company s net sales and results of operations 
in june of  microsoft stated that it would no longer develop new versions of internet explorer for the mac os 
microsoft s decision to discontinue development of internet explorer for mac os x appears to have been influenced in part by the company s introduction during of its own web browser  safari 
it is unclear what impact  if any  microsoft s decision to cease further development of internet explorer for mac os x will have on the company 
however  if customers chose not to purchase the company s products because internet explorer is not available on the macintosh platform or should websites fail to provide support for web browsers other than internet explorer  the company s net sales and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the company s business relies on access to patents and intellectual property obtained from third parties  and the company s future results could be adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others 
many of the company s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties 
while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods  the company believes that based upon past experience and industry practice  such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
however  there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available or available on acceptable terms 
because of technological changes in the computer industry  current extensive patent coverage  and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents  it is possible certain components of the company s products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others 
the company has from time to time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
responding to such claims  regardless of their merit  can be time consuming  result in significant expenses  and cause the diversion of management and technical personnel 
several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation 
the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these cases 
however  no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur 
in the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain of its products or a successful claim of infringement against the company requiring it to pay royalties to a third party  the company s future operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
information regarding claims and litigation involving the company related to alleged patent infringement and other matters is set forth in part i  item of this form k 
in the opinion of management  the company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  or financial condition 
however  the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty 
should the company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others described in part i  item of this form k or should several of these matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period  the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected 
the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons 
the company s profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels 
as a result  the overall profitability of the company in any given period will depend  in part  on the product  geographic  and channel mix reflected in that period s net sales 
the typical concentration of net sales in the third month of the company s fiscal quarters can adversely affect the company s business and operating results 
the company generally sells more products during the third month of each quarter than it does during either of the first two months  a pattern typical in the personal computer industry 
this sales pattern can produce pressure on the company s internal infrastructure during the third month of a quarter and may adversely impact the company s ability to predict its financial results accurately 
developments late in a quarter  such as lower than anticipated demand for the company s products  an internal systems failure  or failure of one of the company s key logistics  components suppliers  or manufacturing partners  can have significant adverse impacts on the company and its results of operations and financial condition 
the company s success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel 
much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel  including its chief executive officer  members of its executive team  and those in technical  marketing and staff positions 
experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense  especially in the silicon valley  where the majority of the company s employees are located 
the company has relied on its ability to grant stock options as one mechanism for recruiting and retaining this highly skilled talent 
potential accounting regulations requiring the expensing of stock options may impair the company s future ability to provide these incentives without incurring significant compensation costs 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel 
the company is subject to risks associated with the availability and cost of insurance 
the company has observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional corporate insurance 
such conditions have resulted in higher premium costs  higher policy deductibles  and lower coverage limits 
for some risks  because of cost and or availability  the company does not have insurance coverage 
for these reasons  the company is retaining a greater portion of its insurable risks than it has in the past at relatively greater cost 
business interruptions could adversely affect the company s future operating results 
the company s major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake  fire  power shortages  terrorist attacks and other hostile acts  labor disputes  medical conditions  and other events beyond its control 
the majority of the company s research and development activities  its corporate headquarters  information technology systems  and other critical business operations  including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors  are located near major seismic faults 
the company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake related losses 
the company s operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster 
failure of the company s information technology systems and breaches in the security of data could adversely affect the company s future operating results 
information technology system failures and breaches of data security could disrupt the company s ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially causing delays or cancellation of customer orders  impeding the manufacture or shipment of products  or resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or company information 
management has taken steps to address these concerns by its implementation of sophisticated network security and internal control measures 
however  there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivables 
this risk is heightened as economic conditions worsen 
the company distributes its products through third party computer resellers and retailers and directly to certain educational institutions and commercial customers 
a substantial majority of the company s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance 
the company also has non trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale by the company of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub assemblies or assemble final products for the company 
while the company has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and non trade receivables  there can be no assurance that such procedures will be effective in limiting its credit risk and avoiding losses 
additionally  if the global economy and regional economies fail to improve or continue to deteriorate  it becomes more likely that the company will incur a material loss or losses as a result of the weakening financial condition of one or more of its customers or manufacturing vendors 
the company is subject to risks associated with environmental regulations 
production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the company to environmental and other regulations including  in some instances  the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life  and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the company 
such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the company operates  including various european union member countries  japan and california 
although the company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws  there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operation and financial position 
changes in accounting rules could adversely affect the company s future operating results 
financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles are subject to interpretation by various governing bodies  including the fasb and the sec  who interpret and create appropriate accounting regulations 
a change from current accounting regulations can have a significant effect on the company s results of operations and could impact the manner in which the company conducts business 
unanticipated changes in the company s tax rates could affect its future results 
the company s future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates  changes in the valuation of the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities  or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation 
in addition  the company is subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
the company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on its operating results and financial condition 
the company s stock price may be volatile 
the company s stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of announcements by the company and its competitors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these factors  including lack of positive performance in the company s stock price  as well as general economic and political conditions and investors concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial reporting and integrity of financial markets  may materially adversely affect the market price of the company s stock in the future 
the company s acquisition activity could disrupt its ongoing business and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transaction 
the company has acquired and may continue to acquire companies that have products  services  personnel and technologies that complement the company s strategic direction and product roadmap 
these acquisitions may involve significant risks and uncertainties  including difficulties in incorporating the acquired companies operations and technologies  distraction of management s attention away from normal business operations  insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with acquisition  and unidentified issues not discovered in the company s due diligence process  including product quality issues and legal contingencies 
acquisitions are inherently risky  and no assurance can be given that the company s previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect business  operating results or financial condition 
the company has generally paid cash for its acquisitions 
should the company issue its common stock or other equity related purchase rights as consideration in an acquisition  current shareholders percentage ownership and earnings per share may become diluted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and foreign currency risk management to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the company s foreign exchange and interest rate hedge positions  as well as to monitor the risks and opportunities of the non hedge portfolios  the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions  and its interest rate swap and option positions both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures  respectively  from both an accounting and an economic perspective 
however  given the effective horizons of the company s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to hedge  there can be no assurance the aforementioned programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates 
in addition  the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect the company s operating results and financial position 
the company adopted sfas no 
as of october  sfas no 
established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  hedging activities  and exposure definition 
management does not believe that ongoing application of sfas no 
will significantly alter the company s hedging strategies 
however  its application may increase the volatility of other income and expense and other comprehensive income 
interest rate risk while the company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world s leading industrialized countries  the company s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges 
the company s fixed income investment policy and strategy is to ensure the preservation of capital  meet liquidity requirements  and optimize return in light of the current credit and interest rate environment 
the company benchmarks its performance by utilizing external money managers to manage a small portion of the aggregate investment portfolio 
the external managers adhere to the company s investment policies and also provide occasional research and market information that supplements internal research used to make credit decisions in the investment process 
during  the company issued million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering registered with the sec 
the notes were sold at of par  for an effective yield to maturity of 
the notes pay interest semiannually and mature on february  the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio and debt obligations and related derivative financial instruments 
the company places its short term investments in highly liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company s general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents  highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short term investments 
as of september   approximately million of the company s short term investments had underlying maturities ranging from and years 
as of september   billion of the company s investment portfolio classified as short term investments had maturities ranging from to years 
the remainder all had underlying maturities between and months 
due to liquidity needs  or in anticipation of credit deterioration  or for the purpose of duration management of the company s investment portfolio  the company may sell investments prior to their stated maturities 
as a result of such activity  the company recognized net gains of million in and million in in order to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company s investment portfolio  the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve 
based on investment positions as of september   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio 
as of september   a similar basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a million decline in fair value 
such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity 
except in instances noted above  the company s policy is to hold investments to maturity 
the company sometimes enters into interest rate derivative transactions  including interest rate swaps  collars  and floors  with financial institutions in order to better match the company s floating rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short term investments with its fixed rate interest expense on its debt  and or to diversify a portion of the company s exposure away from fluctuations in short term us interest rates 
the company may also enter into interest rate contracts that are intended to reduce the cost of the interest rate risk management program 
the company entered into no interest rate asset swaps during or and had no open interest rate asset swaps at september  in prior years  the company had entered into interest rate debt swaps with financial institutions 
the interest rate debt swaps  which qualified as accounting hedges  generally required the company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three or six month us dollar libor and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts 
these swaps effectively converted the company s fixed rate year debt to floating rate debt and convert a portion of the floating rate investments to fixed rate 
due to prevailing market interest rates  during the company entered into and then subsequently closed out debt swap positions realizing a gain of million 
during the company closed out all of its then existing debt swap positions realizing a gain of million 
both the gains in and were deferred  recognized in long term debt and are being amortized to other income and expense over the remaining life of the debt 
foreign currency risk overall  the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  generally benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect the company s net sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars 
there is also a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing within the time frame of our hedged positions due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions primarily to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities  certain firmly committed transactions  and probable but not firmly committed transactions 
generally  the company s practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures 
however  the company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality  prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures  and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments 
the company also enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies of its foreign subsidiaries 
in order to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company s foreign currency derivative positions  the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value at risk var model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates 
the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate random market price paths 
the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value  for a given confidence interval  to the company s foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates 
the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool 
the model assumes normal market conditions 
forecasted transactions  firm commitments  and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model 
based on the results of the model  the company estimates with confidence a maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september  compared to a maximum one day loss of million as of september  because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes  losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures 
actual gains and losses in the future associated with the company s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september  due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates  foreign currency exchanges rates  and the company s actual exposures and positions
