general our principal asset is the ownership of our banks 
accordingly  our results of operations are primarily dependent upon the results of operations of our banks 
our banks conduct a commercial banking business which consists of attracting deposits from the general public and applying those funds to the origination of commercial  consumer and real estate loans including commercial loans collateralized by real estate 
the banks profitablity depends primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income generated from interest earning assets ie  loans and investments less the interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities ie  customer deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate paid and earned on these balances 
net interest income is dependent upon the banks interest rate spread  which is the difference between the average yield earned on its interest earning assets and the average rate paid on its interest bearing liabilities 
when interest earning assets approximates or exceeds interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate interest income 
the interest rate spread is impacted by interest rates  deposit flows and loan demand 
additionally  and to a lesser extent  the profitability of the banks is affected by such factors as the level of noninterest income and expenses  the provision for loan losses and the effective tax rate 
noninterest income consists primarily of service charges on deposit accounts and other fees and income from the sale of loans and investment securities 
noninterest expenses consist of compensation and benefits  occupancy related expenses and other operating expenses 

table of contents results of operations for years ended december   and our results of operations are determined by our ability to effectively manage interest income and expense  to minimize loan and investment losses  to generate noninterest income and to control noninterest expense 
since interest rates are determined by market forces and economic conditions beyond our control  the ability to generate net interest income is dependent upon the ability of the banks to obtain an adequate spread between the rate earned on interest earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
thus  the key performance measure for net interest income is the interest margin or net yield  which is taxable equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets 
the primary component of consolidated earnings is net interest income  or the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
interest earning assets consist of loans  investment securities and federal funds sold 
interest bearing liabilities consist of deposits  federal home loan bank borrowings and other short term borrowings 
a portion of interest income is earned on tax exempt investments such as state and municipal bonds 
in an effort to state this tax exempt income and its resultant yields on a basis comparable to all other taxable investments  an adjustment is made to analyze this income on a taxable equivalent basis 
the net interest margin decreased basis points to in as compared to in this decrease resulted primarily from the monetary policy pursued by the federal reserve during during the federal reserve reduced the discount rate on separate occasions resulting in a reduction in the prime interest rate a total of basis points from on january  to on december  the prime interest rate on december  was one half of the effective rate on january  the federal reserve reduced the discount by basis points in november resulting in the reduction in the prime interest of basis points to

table of contents during  we acquired two new subsidiary banks and two branches of other banks which have now been merged with two of our banks 
these new bank and branch acquisitions were accounted for as purchases 
following is a summary of assets and liabilities related to the acquisitions of the two new subsidiary banks and one branch 
the acquisition of one branch was not consummated until december   consequently  the balances related to that branch have not been included because the results would not be materially different had the balances been included 
interest earning assets loans investment securities deposit in and federal funds sold to banks total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities deposits other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities noninterest bearing deposits total deposits the allowance for loan losses represents a reserve for potential losses in the loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated periodically based on a review of all significant loans  with a particular emphasis on nonaccruing  past due and other loans that management believes require attention 
we segregate our loan portfolio by type of loan and utilize this segregation in evaluating exposure to risks within the portfolio 
in addition  based on internal reviews and external reviews performed by independent auditors and regulatory authorities  we further segregates our loan portfolio by loan classifications within each type of loan based on an assessment of risk for a particular loan or group of loans 
certain reviewed loans require specific allowances 
allowances are provided for other types and classifications of loans based on anticipated loss rates 
allowances are also provided for loans that are reviewed by management and considered creditworthy and loans for which management determines no review is required 
in establishing allowances  management considers historical loan loss experience with an emphasis on current loan quality trends  current economic conditions and other factors in the markets where the subsidiary banks operate 
factors considered include among others  unemployment rates  effect of weather on agriculture and significant local economic events  such as major plant closings 
we have developed a methodology for determining the adequacy of the loan loss reserve which is followed by all our banks and monitored by abc s senior credit officer and internal audit staff 
procedures provide for the assignment of a risk rating for every loan included in our total loan portfolio  with the exception of credit card receivables and overdraft protection loans which are treated as pools for risk rating purposes 
the risk rating schedule provides seven ratings of which three ratings are classified as pass ratings and four ratings are classified as criticized ratings 
each risk rating is assigned a percent factor to be applied to the loan balance to determine the adequate amount of reserve 
many of the larger loans require an annual review by an independent loan officer 
as a result of loan reviews certain loans may be assigned specific reserve allocations 
other loans that surface as problem loans may also be assigned specific reserves 
past due loans are assigned risk ratings based on the number of days past due 
the provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings in the current period to replenish the allowance and maintain it at a level management has determined to be adequate 
the provision for loan losses charged to earnings amounted to  in   in  and  in the increase in the provision for loan losses in was necessary to cover an increase in average loans of over and increase of net loan charge offs of in as compared to real estate loans and consumer loans accounted for the majority of loan charge offs in these charge offs resulted from depressed economic conditions during the year

for at december   the allowance for loan losses was of total loans outstanding as compared to an allowance for loan losses of of total loans outstanding at december  and of total loans outstanding at december  the determination of the allowance rests upon management s judgment about factors affecting loan quality and assumptions about the local and national economy 
management considers the year end allowance for loan losses adequate to cover potential losses in the consolidated loan portfolio

following is a description of the accounting policies applied by abc that are deemed critical 
critical accounting policies are defined as policies that are very important to the presentation of abc s financial condition and results of operations  and that require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
abc s financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are applied in the application of these policies 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses charged to operations 
loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collection of principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on a formal analysis that assesses the risk within the loan portfolio 
this analysis includes consideration of historical performance  current economic conditions  level of nonperforming loans  loan concentrations  and review of certain individual loans 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the subsidiary banks allowances for loan losses 
such agencies may require the subsidiary banks to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
considering current information and events regarding a borrower s ability to repay its obligations  management considers a loan to be impaired when the ultimate collectibility of all amounts due  according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  is in doubt 
when a loan is considered to be impaired  the amount of impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
if the loan is collateral dependent  the fair value of the collateral is used to determine the amount of impairment 
impairment losses are included in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to the provision for losses on loans 
subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
cash receipts for accruing loans are applied to principal and interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
cash receipts on impaired loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are applied first to principal and then to interest income 

table of contents the accounting for impaired loans described above applies to all loans  except for large pools of smaller balance  homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment  loans that are measured at fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value  and debt securities 
the allowance for loan losses for large pools of smaller balance  homogeneous loans is established through consideration of such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  overall portfolio quality  adequacy of the underlying collateral  loan concentrations  historical charge off trends  and economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to pay 
certain economic and interest rate factors could have a material impact on the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
the depth  duration  and dispersion of any economic recession all have an impact on the credit risk profile of the loan portfolio 
additionally  a rapidly rising interest rate environment that may cause rates to reach double digits could as well have a material impact on certain borrowers ability to pay 
our current assumptions are that an economic recovery will occur during the second half of and that the depth of the recession will have already peaked prior to the first half of additionally  we are assuming that the effect of the recession will have had its greatest impact on economic conditions  including unemployment  by the end of with respect to the interest rate environment  abc anticipates that interest rates will be increasing slightly during in the event of a dramatic downturn in this recession in which there is a broad effect in all sectors of our economy and or a significant rapid rise in interest rates to double digit levels creating higher borrowing costs and tightening corporate profits  abc s credit costs could increase significantly 
another factor that we have considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses is loan concentrations to individual borrowers or industries 
at december   abc had individual credit relationships that exceeded million with none exceeding million 
a substantial portion of the loan portfolio is in the commercial real estate and residential real estate sectors those loans are secured by real estate in abc s primary market area 
a substantial of portion of other real estate owned is located in those same markets 
therefore  the ultimate collectibility of a substantial portion of our loan portfolio and the recovery of a substantial portion of the carrying amount of other real estate owned are susceptible to changes to market conditions in abc s primary market area 
abc is closely monitoring certain portions of its loan portfolio that we believe have a higher credit risk profile under the current environment based solely upon their industry classification which includes agricultural and agribusiness loans 
based on current information  we have not identified any problem credits included in these categories  which are not already classified as nonperforming or impaired loans 
however  if the economic recovery takes longer than expected  the allowance for loan losses could be impacted by adverse developments in these credits 
income taxes sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for deferred income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation and the provision for loan losses  for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or adjust this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provisions in the statement of income 
we have recorded on our consolidated balance sheet net deferred tax assets of  which includes amounts relating to loss carryforwards 
we believe there will be sufficient taxable income in the future allowing is to utilize these loss carryforwards in the tax jurisdictions where they exist 

table of contents long lived assets  including intangibles we evaluate long lived assets  such as property and equipment  specifically identifiable intangibles and goodwill  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets might not be recoverable 
factors that could trigger an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets as compared to the carrying value of the assets 
if an impairment has occurred  the amount of the impairment loss recognized would be determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the fair value was less than the book value 
in determining the existence of impairment factors  our assessment is based on market conditions  operational performance and legal factors of our company and its subsidiary banks 
our review of factors present and the resulting appropriate carrying value of our goodwill  intangibles  and other long lived assets are subject to judgments and estimates that management is required to make 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets might be impaired 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk abc is exposed only to u 
s 
dollar interest rate changes and  accordingly  we manage exposure by considering the possible changes in the net interest margin 
we do not have any trading instruments nor do we classify any portion of the investment portfolio as held for trading 
we do not engage in any hedging activities or enter into any derivative instruments with a higher degree of risk than mortgage backed securities  which are commonly  pass through securities 
finally  we have no exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  and other market risks 
interest rates play a major part in the net interest income of a financial institution 
the sensitivity to rate changes is known as interest rate risk 
the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can influence the changes in net interest income 
as part of our asset liability management program  the timing of repriced assets and liabilities is referred to as gap management 
our policy is to maintain a gap ratio in the one year time horizon of 
to 
as indicated by the gap analysis included in this annual report  the company is somewhat asset sensitive in relation to changes in market interest rates 
being asset sensitive would result in net interest income increasing in a rising rate environment and decreasing in a declining rate environment 
see asset liability management included in this annual report 
abc uses simulation analysis to monitor changes in net interest income due to changes in market interest rates 
the simulation of rising  declining and flat interest rate scenarios allow management to monitor and adjust interest rate sensitivity to minimize the impact of market interest rate swings 
the analysis of the impact on net interest income over a twelve month period is subjected to a gradual basis point increase or decrease in market rates on net interest income and is monitored on a quarterly basis 
the most recent simulation model projects net interest income would increase if rates rise gradually over the next year 
on the other hand  the model projects net interest income to decrease if rates decline over the next year

table of contents asset liability management a principal objective of our asset liability management strategy is to minimize its exposure to changes in interest rates by matching the maturity and repricing horizons of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
this strategy is overseen in part through the direction of our asset and liability committee the alco committee which establishes policies and monitors results to control interest rate sensitivity 
as part of our interest rate risk management policy  the alco committee examines the extent to which its assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and monitors its interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is considered to be interest rate sensitive if it will reprice or mature within the time period analyzed  usually one year or less 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities scheduled to mature or reprice within such time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
if abc s assets and liabilities were equally flexible and moved concurrently  the impact of any increase or decrease in interest rates on net interest income would be minimal 
a simple interest rate gap analysis by itself may not be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates 
accordingly  the alco committee also evaluates how the repayment of particular assets and liabilities is impacted by changes in interest rates 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates 
in addition  the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may not react identically to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates 
in addition  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features generally referred to as interest rate caps which limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the interest rate gap 
the ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 

table of contents the following table sets forth the distribution of the repricing of our earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december   the interest rate sensitivity gap ie  interest rate sensitive assets divided by interest rate sensitivity liabilities  the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio ie  interest rate sensitive assets divided by interest rate sensitive liabilities and the cumulative sensitivity gap ratio 
the table also sets forth the time periods in which earning assets and liabilities will mature or may reprice in accordance with their contractual terms 
however  the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the net interest margin since the repricing of various categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive pressures and the needs of our customers 
in addition  various assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same period may in fact reprice at different times within such period and at different rates 
at december  maturing or repricing within zero to three months three months to one year one to five years over five years total dollars in thousands earning assets interest bearing deposits in banks restricted stock investment securities loans interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits savings certificates less than  certificates   and over other short term borrowings other borrowings trust preferred securities interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap interest rate sensitivity gap ratio cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio the company has found that now and money market checking deposits and savings deposits reprice between three months and one year or between one to five years depending on the competition in the market areas where the deposits are located 
therefore  it has placed portions of these deposits in the three months to one year horizon and the one to five years horizon based on estimated amounts repricing in each horizon

the banks have also granted commitments to approved customers for standby letters of credit 
these commitments are recorded in the financial statements when funds are disbursed or the financial instruments become payable 
the banks use the same credit policies for these off balance sheet commitments as they do for financial instruments that are recorded in the consolidated financial statements

the company believes that the discontinuation of credit card activities will not have a material effect on the company s future operations 
impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and practices within the banking industry which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation
