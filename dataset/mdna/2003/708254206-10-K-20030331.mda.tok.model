terminated merger with philadelphia suburban corporation on april   the company entered into a definitive agreement with philadelphia suburban corporation psc to merge into a wholly owned subsidiary of psc with shareholders of the company receiving shares of psc in the merger 
total expenses associated with the pending psc merger transaction were approximately  for the twelve months ended december  those expenses are broken down as follows legal fees  investment banking fees  other fees  total merger costs  as discussed in note commitments and contingencies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company and psc mutually decided to terminate the merger agreement on february  following a january  referendum by the city of nashua 
the referendum authorized the city of nashua to pursue the acquisition  by an eminent domain proceeding or otherwise  of all or a portion of the company s water works systems serving the residents of nashua and other communities in which the company s three regulated utilities operate 
under current internal revenue code regulations  certain merger related costs would not have been deductible for federal income tax purposes if the merger had been ultimately consummated 
accordingly  throughout the first three quarters of  the company calculated its tax provision based on the assumption that these merger related expenses would not be deductible for tax purposes either currently or in the future 
however  as a result of the subsequent termination of the merger agreement  these merger related costs are deductible for tax purposes 
the company s tax provision reflects the tax benefit resulting from the change in treatment of these costs 
results of operations in this section  we discuss our  and results of operations and the factors affecting them 
our consolidated revenues tend to be significantly affected by weather conditions experienced throughout the year and by sales of major real estate parcels which may occur from time to time see disclosure of operative risk factors contained elsewhere in this report 
water revenues are typically at their lowest point during the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year 
however  water revenues in the second and third quarters tend to be greater because of increased water consumption for non essential usage by our customers during the late spring and summer months 
results of operations compared to for the year ended december   the company s consolidated net income was million  compared to net income of million in  a decrease of 
on a per share basis  basic income per share was 
for the twelve months ended december   a 
per share decrease from last year 
the decrease in consolidated net income was principally due to the transaction expenses incurred during relating to the proposed merger with psc which was subsequently terminated in february excluding the effect of those merger expenses  consolidated net income for was million  or per share 
consolidated revenues in were million  a increase over last year 
as discussed below  increased revenues resulted primarily in the company s regulated water and contract operations businesses offset by decreased revenues from land sales in water utility operations utility operating revenues for increased to million  or  from for  approximately  and of our total utility operating revenues were generated by pennichuck  pennichuck east and pittsfield  respectively  which was not materially different than in as shown in the following table change pennichuck    pennichuck east    pittsfield    total    the million increase in pennichuck s revenues from to is principally due to the positive effect of an rate increase granted to pennichuck in september and an additional rate increase granted to pennichuck in march the annualized effect of those two rate increases was estimated to be approximately million 
however  the positive effect of those rate increases in was partially offset by a decline in billed consumption within the core system from through the first nine months of  rainfall in the region in which the utilities operate was greater than in the same period of thus contributing to the overall decline in consumption for the year 
in addition to the core system rate increases  water revenues reflect a growth approximately customers in the combined utilities customer base from december  to december  during  there were no new rate filings made by the company s three regulated water utilities and no such rate proceedings are pending with the nhpuc 
the operating expenses of our water utility business include such categories as water treatment and purification  pumping and other distribution system functions  general and administrative functions  depreciation on existing operating assets  and taxes other than income taxes principally payroll and property taxes our utilities operating expenses increased by  or  to million for the year ended december  the primary reasons for the increased utility operating costs from to were  of additional depreciation expense reflecting new investment in plant assets during and totaling and million for each year  respectively  net of contributions in aid of construction  an increase of approximately  in local property taxes reflecting higher assessed values on utility property  a  increase in pension expense as a result of declining investment returns on pension plan assets and increased payroll costs  a  increase  or  in property and liability premiums paid  consistent with recent changes in the insurance market  offset by approximately  in lower power and purification expenses as a result of the decrease in consumption discussed earlier and  in additional capitalized overhead on new plant placed in service during the utilities combined operating income operating revenues less operating expenses for the year ended december  increased to million  or  over  resulting in an operating margin of in compared to an operating margin of in real estate operations for the year ended december   operating income from real estate activities conducted by southwood was million compared to million in the following table summarizes the major sales and other transactions that occurred in and which are discussed further in this section

revenues recorded by southwood during and represent its share of the net operating income resulting from the leasing activities of hecop s i  ii and iii 
each of those three llc s owns land and a commercial office building  all of which are subject to a mortgage note with a local bank 
the outstanding mortgage note balances at december  totaled approximately million as discussed in note equity investments in unconsolidated companies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the principal asset of hecop iv was approximately acres of land held for future development 
during  a major tenant occupying one of the buildings owned by an llc filed for bankruptcy protection 
however  the tenant s bank has issued a letter of credit for the benefit of the llc guaranteeing the tenant s full lease payments over the remaining term of its lease which expires on march  the llc is actively looking for a new party to occupy the portion of office space approximately  square feet that is no longer utilized by the tenant

under the terms of that sale  southwood received cash of approximately  and a million note  maturing in october the note carries a floating interest rate of prime plus and is secured by a first mortgage on the property 
the pretax gain on that sale is approximately million 
contract operations and other for the year ended december   operating income from our contract operations was  an increase of  or from the following table provides a breakdown of contract operations revenues for and change service corporation municipal contracts    community system contracts    watertight program    miscellaneous    total service corporation    more than half of the  increase in the service company s revenue over resulted from additional contract fees of  billed by the service corporation under an operating contract with the town of salisbury  massachusetts which began in october and was in effect during all of under the terms of that multi year contract  the service corporation operates and maintains that municipality s water system  including all meter reading and billing functions 
the contract provides for annual adjustments to contract fees based on changes in the consumer price index 
during  other service corporation revenues included i  earned under its watertight program  which provides maintenance service to residential customers and ii contract revenues of approximately  from operating contracts for non transient  non community water systems 
at the end of  the service corporation had such operating contracts 
under these contracts  the service corporation performs various water related monitoring  maintenance  testing and compliance reporting services for water systems throughout southern and central new hampshire 
other operating revenues not related to contract operations in totaled  which included approximately  from timber harvesting activities on forested land owned by the company 
no timber harvesting activities were undertaken during expenses associated with our service corporation activities were  and  for and  respectively  primarily comprised of direct costs for servicing its various operating contracts and allocated intercompany charges 
the increased expenses from to resulted principally from i additional annualized direct expenses of  relating to the town of salisbury contract   in increased watertight program related expenses  an increase of  in allocated intercompany charges due to additional company and pennichuck resources utilized for the operation and development of the service corporation s various activities and  of amortization charges reflecting the write off of certain deferred charges related to non transient  non community water systems 
results of operations compared to there was a significant shift in the earnings among the company s core businesses from to although consolidated net income decreased to million in from million in  practically all of that decrease resulted from the fact that gains on two major land sales were realized in by westwood 
the impact of those sales alone on earnings per share was 
in as discussed below  the earnings from our utility operations  however  increased by  or 
per share over water utility operations on a combined basis  operating income of our three utilities in calendar year was approximately million compared to million in utility operating revenues for totaled million a increase from for  approximately  and of our total utility operating revenues were generated by pennichuck  pennichuck east and pittsfield  respectively  which was not materially different than in the principal reasons for the increase in our utility revenues were a  increase in billed consumption within pennichuck s core system from to resulting from the extended hot and dry weather conditions during compared to  an temporary rate increase granted to pennichuck effective on september  resulting in approximately  of additional revenues  and a increase in billed consumption within pennichuck east s system from to as a result of the weather conditions noted above 
in june  pennichuck filed for a rate increase with the nhpuc  representing a request for million in additional annual revenues 
in connection with that rate filing  the nhpuc approved a temporary rate increase of applied on bills rendered on or after september  on march   the nhpuc issued its final order in which it granted final approval of an overall revenue increase 
the approved rate order includes an rate increase on bills rendered on or after september  and an additional step adjustment of on service rendered on or after march  combined utility operating expenses increased by  or  to million for the year ended december  that increase is attributable to i  of additional depreciation incurred by our three utilities during reflecting their million net investment in new plant assets during and ii approximately  for additional administrative costs  primarily health insurance and other employee benefit costs 
as a result of the increase in utility revenues  offset partially by the increase in utility expenses  the utilities combined operating income increased by  from to as a percentage of combined utility revenues  the utilities operating margin increased from in to in real estate operations operating income from our real estate operations was approximately million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
real estate earnings during and were positively impacted by major real estate sales conducted through westwood 
in  westwood sold a parcel of land to the city of nashua for million while in  westwood sold two land parcels having a combined sales price of approximately million 
southwood s share of the after tax gain from these sales was 
per share and 
per share for calendar years and  respectively 
in addition to the revenues generated by westwood  other real estate revenues during include  as southwood s share of pretax profit from its residential joint venture known as heron cove at bowers pond llc   from the sale of two land parcels in southwood corporate park   from the sale of a residential land parcel to a local developer  and  from southwood s share of pretax income relating to its ownership in three commercial office buildings 
the operating expenses associated with our real estate operations decreased from million in to  in principally all of that decrease relates to the allocated land and infrastructure development costs associated with the westwood land sales in discussed earlier 
the operating expenses in were comprised of i  of property taxes on southwood s landholdings  ii  of direct infrastructure costs allocable to the southwood corporate park land sales and iii  for allocated intercompany charges 
contract operations and other revenues from contract operations and other increased  or  to  in from the previous year 
of that increase  nearly  was generated by the service corporation as a result of i an additional operating contracts signed during and ii a new multi year operating contract with a massachusetts municipality which was entered into in september the service corporation earned nearly  of revenues during the fourth quarter of from that contract 
revenues from other operations increased  to  in this increase was primarily attributable to the sale of timber harvested from portions of the company s undeveloped landholdings 
other revenues also include rental income from several tower leases totaling approximately  in each of and the operating expenses associated with our contract operations and other activities increased significantly from  in to  in  principally as a result of  in added contract operating costs relating to the acquisition of the new systems discussed above   from an increase in allocated intercompany charges  and a  increase in costs relating to shareholder and other administrative matters accrued by the company 
liquidity and financial condition over the past two years  the primary sources of cash needed for normal operating activities  capital projects  debt service and dividend payments were i available cash from the company s short term investments and ii operating cash flow generated from day to day business activities 
during previous periods when available cash and operating cash flow were not sufficient  the company has borrowed funds under a revolving loan facility the loan agreement with its bank 
the loan agreement allows the company and its subsidiaries to borrow up to million at interest rates tied to the bank s cost of funds or libor  whichever is lower 
at december  and  the interest rates under the loan agreement were and  respectively 
during  and  there were no borrowings outstanding under this loan agreement 
as disclosed in note debt in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company has certain debt instruments that contain annual sinking fund or other required principal payments 
the company believes that it will be able to refinance debt instruments at their maturity through public issuance  or private placement  of debt or equity 
at december  and  the company s cash and cash equivalents  primarily short term investments  totaled approximately million and million  respectively  which were available to fund any operating cash flow deficiencies and capital expenditures of the company and its subsidiaries 
throughout and  excess cash was invested in short term money market funds and as a result  the company realized approximately  in interest income in and  in our capital expenditures in totaled million  net of approximately million in the form of contributions in aid of construction from state grants and area developers 
practically all of our capital expenditures in were for projects relating to our water utility business 
in  the more significant projects included million for replacing aging distribution mains in nashua  new hampshire  million for various distribution main upgrades in pennichuck s and pennichuck east s community water systems  and  for the replacement and installation of new radio read meters which is part of an ongoing replacement program in pennichuck s and pennichuck east s service territories 
the remaining items in the company s capital program reflect expenditures for ongoing  routine investment in additional pump stations  services  distribution mains and hydrants  vehicles and sundry system improvements 
for  we expect that our total expenditures for capital projects will be approximately million  of which million is expected to be funded by contributions in aid of construction  state grants and low interest  state revolving loans 
our cash needs for capital expenditures are expected to be met from a combination of internally generated funds and short term investments and if needed  from borrowings under the company s available line of credit 
over the next five years  the company expects to spend approximately million to million annually for capital expenditures  primarily for utility related projects 
pennichuck expects that its capital investment program will continue to include significant expenditures for replacing aging distribution mains in nashua and in certain smaller community water systems 
in  the city of nashua the city began a public works program mandated by the united states environmental protection agency usepa requiring the city to separate its storm water runoff and sewer discharge systems over the next years 
pennichuck will take the opportunity to replace any aged or deteriorating water mains in those sections where the city is performing its sewer separation work 
in the past years  pennichuck has spent approximately million replacing its aged mains and its capital budget includes approximately million for similar work 
it is likely that pennichuck will continue to spend to million annually on replacing its aging infrastructure within nashua 
historically  these capital costs have been recovered through increased water rates as approved by the nhpuc 
there were several significant changes in our consolidated financial position from december  to december   principally in certain asset accounts of the company and its subsidiaries 
those significant changes were a net decrease of  in notes receivable  representing cash collected on amounts due from a local developer as further discussed below and previously classified under other assets at december   a decrease in deferred land costs of million as a result of the write off of the remaining basis of acres in southwood corporate park in connection with the land sale which occurred in the first quarter of  and a net decrease in deferred charges and other assets of  reflecting the company s transition in its pension plan funding status from a  prepaid balance at december  to a  accrued liability at the end of as discussed below 
the aforementioned notes receivable balance at december  represents the remaining amounts due from a local developer for the acquisition of land from southwood and the construction of five homes in a residential development 
during  two homes had been sold to third parties resulting in a repayment of  of principal on the development and construction loans 
the notes carry an annual interest rate of and mature in april the loans are secured by a first mortgage interest in the land and houses 
at december   the  note receivable balance included under current assets related to an amount due from a local developer from the sale of a residential land parcel in october that was repaid in august additional minimum pension liability the company maintains a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of its employees 
the accounting for this plan under fasb  employer s accounting for pensions  requires that the company use key assumptions when computing the estimated annual pension expense 
these assumptions are i the long term return on plan assets  ii the discount rate applied to the projected benefit obligation and iii the long term rate of future increases in compensation 
these key assumptions are reviewed annually with our actuary and investment advisor and are discussed further in note benefit plans pension plan in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
any differences between the assumptions used by the company and actual results will impact the amount of pension expense the company recognizes in the future 
future changes resulting from any such differences are expected to be recoverable through rate relief filed by the utilities with the nhpuc 
at december   the company had a prepaid pension asset of approximately  representing the excess of its plan assets over its pension liabilities 
the decline in investment returns on pension assets and in the discount rate during resulted in the company recording an additional minimum pension liability adjustment of approximately million 
as a result  the company has recorded an accrued pension liability of approximately  at december  and a net charge of approximately  against other comprehensive income 
future adjustments to other comprehensive income will be affected by changes in realized returns on pension plan assets and changes in discount rates 
critical accounting policies the company has identified the accounting policies below as those policies critical to its business operations and the understanding of the results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in significant changes to the financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation stipulates generally accepted accounting principles for companies whose rates are established by or are subject to approval by an independent third party regulator 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we defer costs and credits on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that these costs and credits will be recognized in the rate making process in a period different from when the costs and credits were incurred 
these deferred amounts  both assets and liabilities  are then recognized in the income statement in the same period that they are reflected in rates charged to our water utilities customers 
in the event that future recovery of deferred costs ceases to be probable  the company would be required to charge these assets against current earnings 
accrued unbilled revenue we read our residential customer meters generally on a quarterly basis and record our revenue based on our meter reading results 
unbilled revenues from the last meter reading date to the end of the accounting period are estimated based on historical usage patterns and the effective tariff rates 
the estimate of the unbilled revenue is a management estimate utilizing certain sets of assumptions and conditions 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase plan we offer a dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase program that is available to our shareholders and residential utility customers 
under this program  our shareholders may reinvest all or a portion of their common dividends into shares of common stock at prevailing market prices 
we also accept optional cash payments to purchase additional shares at of the prevailing market prices 
since its inception in  this program has provided the company with nearly million of additional common equity 
environmental matters our water utility subsidiaries are subject to the water quality regulations set forth by the united states environmental protection agency usepa and the new hampshire department of environmental services nhdes 
the usepa is required to periodically set new maximum contaminant levels for certain chemicals as required by the federal safe drinking water act 
the quality of our treated water currently meets or exceeds all standards set by the usepa and the nhdes 
however  increased monitoring and reporting standards have led to additional operating costs for us 
any additional monitoring and testing costs arising from future usepa and nhdes mandates should eventually be recovered through water rates in our utilities next rate filings 
pennichuck s water treatment plant in nashua is impacted by the usepa s interim enhanced surface water treatment rule ieswtr which established a new turbidity standard of ntu 
pennichuck is in the process of performing an evaluation of upgrades to its water treatment plant that will insure compliance with the promulgated ieswtr turbidity standard  the filter backwash recycle rule  the long term one enhanced surface water treatment rules and the future long term two enhanced surface water treatment rule 
the evaluation will determine what modifications will be required to pennichuck s water treatment plant by the end of construction of the required modifications to the water treatment plant is expected to begin in late the expected cost for any modifications required under these standards will not be determinable until completion of the above referenced evaluation 
two of pennichuck s small community water systems have wells that produce water with arsenic levels in excess of the new standard of ppb 
it will be necessary for pennichuck to install arsenic treatment systems at these locations 
pennichuck s remaining community water systems have wells that produce water meeting the new arsenic standard 
capital expenditures associated with federal and state water quality standards have historically been recognized and approved by the nhpuc for inclusion in our utilities water rates 
pending regulatory investigation the company has been informed by the securities and exchange commission and the new hampshire bureau of securities regulation that it is the subject of related investigations by each agency 
the company understands that those investigations relate to various real estate development joint ventures  and include a real estate transaction between one of those joint ventures and maurice l 
arel  the company s president  and the company s previous public disclosure regarding that transaction 
the company s board of directors has retained legal counsel to conduct an independent review of such matters  under the direction of the company s audit committee  and has instructed the company and counsel to cooperate fully with both investigations 
the independent review is ongoing with the cooperation of all executive officers 
note a to the company s financial statements  which were included in the company s annual report to shareholders and incorporated into its annual report on form ksb for that year  disclosed that an executive officer had purchased a home in from a joint venture between a pennichuck subsidiary and an unaffiliated real estate developer 
note a stated that the terms of the home purchase were the same as the terms which would be given to any independent third party purchaser 
mr 
arel is the executive referenced in that disclosure 
the audit committee has obtained information indicating that mr 
arel s home purchase in fact was not on terms that would have been available then to any independent third party purchaser 
the audit committee is continuing to investigate the matter to determine  among other things  the financial impact of the transaction on the company  the value of any benefits received by mr 
arel in that transaction  the circumstances surrounding the preparation of the disclosure in note a to the financial statements  and what  if any  action the company should take against mr 
arel or others 
although the company is cooperating fully with the regulatory investigations  the sec and the new hampshire bureau of securities regulation  upon the completion of their respective investigations  could seek to impose fines  penalties or other sanctions upon the company
