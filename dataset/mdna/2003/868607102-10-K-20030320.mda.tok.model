if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would affect our future operating results 
excess and obsolete inventories the company must make estimates regarding the future use of products and provides a provision for obsolete or slow moving inventories 
if actual product life cycles  product demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required which would affect future operating results 
accrued insurance the company has a self insured retention against product liability claims with insurance coverage over and above the retention 
the company is also self insured for a portion of its employee medical benefits and workers compensation 
product liability claims are routinely reviewed by the company s insurance carrier and management routinely reviews other self insurance risks for purposes of establishing ultimate loss estimates 
in addition  management must determine estimated liability for claims incurred but not reported 
such estimates and any subsequent changes in estimates may result in adjustments to our operating results in the future
