overview we are the recognized global technology and brand leader in providing an enterprise operating platform based on open source technology for the information technology infrastructure of the global we apply our technology leadership to create our enterprise operating platform  red hat enterprise linux and related layered infrastructure technology solutions based on open source technology 
our enterprise solutions meet the functionality requirements and performance demands of the large enterprise and the third party computer hardware and third party software applications that are critical to the large enterprise 
in april  we launched the first in a line of red hat enterprise linux solutions for large enterprise customers  red hat enterprise linux as 
red hat enterprise linux as was available for shipment in may red hat enterprise linux as was developed to compete with proprietary unix and windows as the primary operating platform for applications in the middle tier and data center of the information technology infrastructure of large enterprises 
in march  we launched three additional technology solutions in the red hat enterprise linux line red hat enterprise linux es  red hat enterprise linux ws and red hat enterprise network 
red hat enterprise linux es and ws broaden the areas of the information technology infrastructure to which our enterprise operating platforms are relevant 
for the fiscal year ended february   we sold approximately  subscriptions to our red hat enterprise linux as platform 
this significantly exceeded management s expectations of the number of subscriptions to be sold in the initial year of the release of the red hat enterprise linux technologies 
red hat enterprise network broadens our systems management service offerings for the large enterprise 
we provide the cio of the largest companies in the world with the choice of a red hat enterprise linux operating platform for all application areas of the information technology infrastructure of the enterprise including the technical developer workstation  the edge of the network  the middle tier of the information technology infrastructure and the data center 
red hat enterprise network provides an integrated management service that allows our red hat enterprise linux technologies to be updated and configured and the performance of these technologies to be monitored in an automated fashion 
these technology solutions  and the enterprise technology and systems management service offerings that will follow them  reflect our commitment to provide an enterprise wide infrastructure platform based on open source technology 
our ability to continue to increase market penetration and maintain competitive pricing for our enterprise technology subscriptions are critical to our success 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition  and impairment of long lived assets revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop and sop  and staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
revenue recognition in accordance with these pronouncements can be complex due to the nature and variability of our sales transactions 
subscription revenue subscription revenue is comprised of enterprise retail and embedded revenues 
enterprise subscription revenue is comprised primarily of revenue from sales of red hat enterprise linux software solutions  stronghold enterprise secure web server  software development tools  and technical support and maintenance fees 
during fiscal  we released the first of our red hat enterprise linux offerings  red hat as  es and ws 
our red hat enterprise linux products have a one year base subscription period 
the base subscription entitles the end user to one year of maintenance  which entitles the end user to configuration support and updates and upgrades to the technology  when and if available  during the term of the subscriptions 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our enterprise offerings ratably over the period of the subscription 
our subscription relationships with our large enterprise customers typically have contracts with multiple elements ie  delivered and undelivered products  maintenance and other services 
we allocate revenue to each component of the contract based on objective evidence of its fair value  which is specific to us 
the fair value of each element is based on the price if sold separately 
enterprise subscription revenue also includes revenue from several large unix to linux migration arrangements which were sold prior to the release of red hat enterprise linux in may revenue from these arrangements has been recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  as no other pattern of performance has been discernible nor has there been specific evidence of the fair value of the elements of these arrangements 
these arrangements all reached maturity during fiscal and have been replaced by subscriptions to red hat enterprise linux 
with the release of red hat enterprise linux  we believe that we now have specific evidence of the fair value of the elements of these larger enterprise arrangements and allocate revenue accordingly 
our current release at february  was red hat enterprise linux as which was first shipped in may we sell red hat linux subscription solutions through four channels direct sales  original equipment manufacturers oems  value added resellers and the internet 
revenue recognition periods for each channel are based on the subscription period with red hat that the end purchasers of the subscriptions from these channels receive  which is generally one year 
in addition  our enterprise subscription revenue is partially derived from sales of subscriptions to stronghold enterprise secure web server and red hat enterprise network  and several other enterprise technologies that we distribute 
stronghold enterprise secure web server is available as a layered technology on red hat enterprise linux  as well as other operating systems 
red hat network is an internet based or inside the corporate firewall based systems management service to assure the security  availability and reliability of red hat enterprise linux  stronghold enterprise secure web server  and other red hat software solutions 
red hat enterprise network is sold in the form of a monthly or annual subscription 
revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period 
through our retail distributors  we sell red hat linux consumer products 
the retail product is currently offered in two versions standard and professional 
each version has a different level of red hat support and software applications provided 
during fiscal  we sold two different releases of red hat linux and 
we also provide certain support and subscription services with red hat linux for a period of time  not exceeding two months for no additional fee 
we recognize all of the revenue from the sale of red hat linux ratably over the period that the subscription services are provided 
a reserve for sales returns is recognized for sales of retail software products to distributors  who have a right of return  based on the company s historical experience of sell through to the end user by the distributor 
the return rate experienced by the company over its last three retail product releases has averaged 
the fee is fixed and determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and product returns are estimable 
embedded subscription revenue consists of revenue for technical support and maintenance services provided pursuant to software compiling  debugging  and optimization agreements 
revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  which is typically months 
services revenue services revenue is comprised of enterprise technology services and embedded development 
enterprise technology services is comprised of revenue for enterprise consulting and engineering services  and customer training and education 
enterprise technology services are provided under agreements whereby customers pay us on a fixed fee or hourly basis to assist in the deployment of our enterprise technologies 
enterprise technology engineering services represent revenues earned under arrangements with our oem partners to add functionality to our red hat enterprise linux line of technologies and is generally recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
revenue from customer training and education is recognized at the date the services are performed 
embedded development services are contracts for compiling  debugging  and optimization of various open source software technologies 
revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method  provided that we have the ability to make reliable estimates of progress towards completion  the fee for such services is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates the recoverability of its property and equipment and other assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired  and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
an impairment loss is recognized when the net book value of such assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets or the business to which the assets relate 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets 
results of operations years ended february  and february  total revenue total revenue increased to million for the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  the increase was driven by significant growth in our enterprise subscription and services revenues of our business partially offset by a decline in the embedded segment of our business 
subscription revenue subscription revenue is comprised of revenue from enterprise technologies  retail technologies and embedded customers 
subscription revenue increased to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february  enterprise technologies enterprise technologies revenue primarily relates to both direct and indirect sales of red hat enterprise linux and other related enterprise software solutions such as red hat enterprise network and stronghold enterprise secure web server 
enterprise technologies revenue increased to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february  for the fiscal year ended february   we sold approximately  subscriptions to our red hat enterprise linux as platform 
this significantly exceeded management s expectations of the number of subscriptions to be sold in the initial year of the release of our red hat enterprise linux technologies 
in addition  red hat enterprise network  our systems management services offering  increased revenue by million for the year ended february  our enterprise offerings are sold with annual renewable subscriptions and all have month revenue recognition periods to match the subscription period 
therefore  we will continue to recognize revenue on these subscriptions through fiscal and expect to increase the number of subscriptions sold to red hat enterprise technologies sequentially quarter over quarter during the next months 
we are focused on building the first layer of renewable enterprise subscriptions which will begin to renew in the third quarter of our fiscal retail technologies retail technologies revenue  which consists of sales of red hat linux to consumers through either value added resellers or distributors  decreased to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february  this decrease is due to our focus during fiscal on the sale of subscriptions to our enterprise technologies to large enterprise customers rather than on the consumer market 
we will continue to address the consumer market with our red hat linux release which occurs every six months 
retail technologies revenue has been separately stated on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations as this market is no longer a strategic source of revenue for the company but instead represents a channel for providing leading edge technology to sophisticated users 
these users will help us improve this new technology to the point it has the stability to be introduced into our enterprise offerings 
we expect our retail revenues to decline slightly in fiscal as compared to fiscal embedded embedded subscription revenue decreased to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february  the decrease in embedded markets is primarily due to the continued weak performance of the semiconductor and telecommunications industries which has impacted research and development spending 
we will continue to maintain a small but strategic presence in this market as we believe that a linux open source platform will provide a significant value advantage in the future 
services revenue enterprise technologies enterprise technologies services include fees received from enterprise customers for deployment of red hat enterprise technologies  customer training and education fees and fees received for adding certain functionality to red hat enterprise linux for our major hardware partners 
enterprise technology services revenue increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  the increase in enterprise technology services revenue is primarily due to an increase in the revenue earned from relationships with our oem partners of approximately million and a million increase in consulting services related to services performed for large enterprise customers for the deployment of red hat enterprise linux 
customer training and education services revenue also increased to million in year ended february  from million in the year ended february  the increase in all components of our services revenues is the direct result of the continued migration of larger enterprises to our red hat enterprise linux platform from a proprietary unix platform and the momentum behind the acceptance of red hat enterprise linux as a mission critical computing platform for the large enterprise 
embedded embedded services revenue decreased to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february  the decrease in embedded services revenues is due to the continued weak performance of the semiconductor and telecommunications industries which has impacted research and development spending and due to our reduction in focus and personnel dedicated to this business to a small core team which maintains a strategic presence in this marketplace 
revenues from this segment of our business will be flat to declining in fiscal as compared to fiscal cost of revenue cost of subscription revenue cost of enterprise subscription revenue primarily consists of expenses we incur to manufacture  package  distribute and support our solutions 
these costs include labor related costs to provide technical support and maintenance  bandwidth costs for red hat network  and expenses for physical media  literature  packaging  and shipping 
cost of subscription revenue decreased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  this decrease was related to a million reduction in expenses incurred for physical media  literature  packaging and fulfillment related to our retail product  which is consistent with the decline in retail revenues  partially offset by an increase in the cost of providing technical support and maintenance for our enterprise products 
cost of services revenue cost of services revenue is primarily comprised of salaries and related costs including non cash  stock based compensation charges incurred for our personnel to deliver custom development  enterprise consulting  engineering  training and education  and hardware certification services

the cost of our customer training and education services increased million and our enterprise consulting services increased by million related to headcount additions to our consulting staff 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in embedded development services costs as a result of the restructuring of this segment which was completed in february gross profit gross profit increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  this increase was entirely due to the increase in revenue and profitability related to our red hat enterprise linux offerings which were introduced during the fiscal year ended february  and carry significantly higher gross margins than our retail and embedded product offerings 
the strength in growth and profitability of our enterprise business was offset by the significant decline in the embedded segment which had gross profit of million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal operating expenses sales and marketing sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs including non cash  stock based compensation charges for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  travel  public relations and marketing materials and tradeshows

amortization of goodwill and intangibles amortization of goodwill and intangibles expense decreased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  the decrease in amortization of goodwill and intangibles is primarily due to the fact that for the year ended february   no amortization of goodwill was recorded as prescribed by new accounting principles

we have experienced a substantial increase in our operating expenses since our inception in connection with the growth of our operations  the development of our red hat enterprise linux technologies  the expansion of our services operation and our acquisition activity 
our capital requirements during the year ending february  will depend on numerous factors including the amount of resources we devote to funding the development of our red hat enterprise linux solutions  such as red hat enterprise linux as  es and ws  accelerating the development of our systems management offerings  improving and extending our service offerings and the technologies used to deliver these offerings to our customers  pursuing strategic acquisitions and alliances  and making possible investments in businesses  products and technologies 
we have made substantial progress in reducing the amount of cash required to fund our operations

excluding payments made for restructuring costs expensed in prior periods  our adjusted cash flow provided by operations was million in fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  we used million in cash in our operating activities 
in the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we generated  million and million  respectively  in positive cash flows from our operating activities 
we expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations during fiscal given the significant improvement we have made from using cash to fund our operations to generating million in positive cash flows during the last nine months of fiscal  and the million of cash and investments held at february   we do not anticipate the need to raise funds to fund our operations either through the sale of additional equity or through the issuance of debt for the foreseeable future 
we believe that cash flow from operations will continue to improve  however  there can be no assurances that we will improve our cash flow from operations from the current rate or that such cash flows will be adequate to fund other investments or acquisitions that we may choose to make 
we may choose to accelerate the expansion of our business from our current plans  which may require us to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or debt securities or through other financing means 
there can be no assurances that any such financing would occur in amounts or on terms favorable to us  if at all 
we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements and do not utilize any structured debt  special purpose or similar unconsolidated entities for liquidity or financing purposes 
as of february   our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under capital and operating leases 
the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at february  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total recent accounting pronouncements see discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
risk factors risks related to our business model we depend on the support of linux developers not employed by us for improvements and advancement of our red hat enterprise linux technologies 
we may not be able to release major product upgrades of red hat enterprise linux on a timely basis because the heart of red hat enterprise linux  the linux kernel  is maintained by third parties 
linus torvalds  the original developer of the linux kernel  and a small group of independent engineers are primarily responsible for the development and evolution of the linux kernel 
if this group of developers fails to further develop the linux kernel or if mr 
torvalds or prominent linux developers who are members of this group and are currently employed by red hat  such as alan cox  david miller or stephen tweedie  were to join one of our competitors or no longer work on the linux kernel  we would have to either rely on another party to further develop the kernel or develop it ourselves 
we cannot predict whether enhancements to the kernel would be available from reliable alternative sources 
we could be forced to rely to a greater extent on our own development efforts  which would increase our development expenses and may delay our product release and upgrade schedules 
in addition  any failure on the part of the kernel developers to further develop and enhance the kernel could stifle the development of additional linux based applications 
we depend on collaboration with a wide range of companies with diverse interests in developing and selling red hat enterprise linux 
one of the appealing aspects of red hat enterprise linux to our business partners  such as dell  hp  ibm  intel  and oracle  is the ability to suggest enhancements to the technology 
it is not unusual for the needs of those business partners to be in conflict with each other 
at the same time  we are dependent on the sales channels provided by these partners  some of which provide services that compete with our services  for the sale of red hat enterprise linux 
we may not be able to satisfy all the requirements of these business partners  or be able to offer the same range of services in support of red hat enterprise linux as these business partners  and we may not be able to sufficiently incent their sales channels to promote red hat enterprise linux 
should we fail in any of these aspects we may not be able to expand our business and or increase our market share 
the scarcity of availability of software applications for linux based operating systems could prevent widespread commercial adoption of our products 
our products will not be able to gain widespread commercial adoption by the large enterprise until there are more third party enterprise software applications that have been migrated to operate on linux based operating systems 
these applications include databases  software development tools  enterprise middleware  such as messaging and file system technologies 
we intend to encourage the development of additional applications that operate on linux based operating systems by attracting third party developers to the linux platform  by providing open source tools to create these applications and by maintaining our existing developer relationships through marketing and technical support for third party developers 
if we are not successful in achieving these goals  however  our products will not gain widespread commercial acceptance and we will not be able to maintain our product sales growth 
we may be unable to predict the future course of open source technology development  which could reduce the market appeal of our products and damage our reputation 
we do not exercise control over many aspects of the development of open source technology 
historically  different groups of open source software programmers have competed with each other to develop new technology 
typically  one of those groups develops the technology that becomes more widely used than that developed by others 
if we adopt new technology and incorporate it into our products  and competing technology becomes more widely used  the market appeal of our products may be reduced  which could harm our reputation  diminish the red hat brand and result in decreased revenue 
there are few technology barriers to entry in the open source market 
one of the enduring aspects of open source software is that anyone can modify the existing software or develop new software that competes with existing open source software 
such competition can develop without the degree of overhead and lead time required by traditional proprietary software companies 
it is possible for a competitor with greater resources to develop its own open source operating system solution  potentially reducing the demand for red hat s solutions 
risks related to our financial results and condition we have incurred substantial net losses on a gaap basis in the past 
we have incurred net losses in seven of our previous eight fiscal years  including our most recent fiscal year ended february  while we have significantly reduced these losses and  we do not expect to incur significant losses in the future  we cannot be certain when we will achieve sustained profitability 
failure to become and remain profitable may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital and continue operations 
you should not rely on our quarterly results of operations as an indication of our future results 
due to the unpredictability of the technology spending environment  our revenue and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we base our current and projected future expense levels in part on our estimates of future revenue 
our expenses are  to a large extent  fixed in the short term 
we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough to protect our projected operating results for a quarter if our revenue in that quarter falls short of our expectations 
our future operating results may fall below expectations of securities analysts or investors  which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
we may not be able to effectively attract additional enterprise customers and preserve relationships with current enterprise customers  which could adversely affect revenue 
historically  we focused our sales and marketing efforts on product sales to individuals 
in late fiscal  we began to focus the predominant portion of our sales and marketing efforts on expanding our enterprise customer base 
to this end  we have invested extensively to attract enterprise customers 
while we have been successful to date in acquiring large enterprise customers  if we are unsuccessful in gaining additional large enterprise customers in the future  it will adversely impact our future revenue growth 
we may not be able to continue to attract capable management personnel 
as we have built our management team over the past three years we have done so during a time of significant unemployment and downturn in the technology sector 
this has given us the opportunity to attract highly capable management personnel 
however  our ability to retain key management personnel or hire capable new management personnel as we grow may be challenged if the technology sector rebounds and companies with more generous compensation packages or greater perceived growth opportunities compete for these same personnel 
we depend on our key personnel 
our future success depends on the continued services of a number of key officers  including our chief executive officer and president  matthew j 
szulik  our executive vice president engineering  paul cormier  and our chief financial officer  kevin b 
thompson 
the loss of the technical knowledge and industry expertise of any of these people could seriously impede our success 
moreover  the loss of one or a group of our key employees  particularly to a competitor  and any resulting loss of customers could reduce our market share and diminish the red hat brand 
we may lack the financial and operational resources needed to increase our market share and compete effectively with unix operating systems providers  microsoft  other established operating systems developers  software development tools developers and other service providers 
in the market for operating systems  we face significant competition from larger companies with greater financial resources and name recognition than we have 
these competitors  which offer hardware independent multi user operating systems for intel platforms and or unix based operating systems  include microsoft  novell  ibm  sun microsystems  hewlett packard  and unisys 
some of these competitors may in the future  produce and market a competing open source operating system 
as we increase our services offerings  we may face competition from larger and more capable companies that currently service and support the linux operating system as well as other operating systems  particularly unix based operating systems  due to the fact that linux and unix based operating systems share many common features 
these companies  including ibm and hewlett packard  may be able to leverage their existing service organizations and provide higher levels of consulting and support on a more cost effective basis than we can 
we may not be able to compete successfully with these current or potential competitors 
if we fail to establish and maintain strategic distribution and other collaborative relationships with industry leading companies  we may not be able to attract and retain a larger customer base 
our success depends on our ability to continue to establish and maintain strategic distribution and other collaborative relationships with industry leading hardware manufacturers such as hewlett packard  dell  ibm  fujitsu and others  distributors  software vendors such as oracle and enterprise solutions providers 
these relationships allow us to offer our products and services to a much larger customer base than we would otherwise be able to through our direct sales and marketing efforts 
we may not be able to maintain these relationships or replace them on attractive terms 
in addition  our existing strategic relationships do not  and any future strategic relationships may not  afford us any exclusive marketing or distribution rights 
as a result  the companies with which we have strategic alliances are free to pursue alternative technologies and to develop alternative products and services in addition to or in lieu of our products and services  either on their own or in collaboration with others  including our competitors 
moreover  we cannot guarantee that the companies with which we have strategic relationships will market our products effectively or continue to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales  marketing and technical support 
we may not be able to meet the operational and financial challenges that we will encounter as our international operations continue to expand 
as we expand our international operations  we will face a number of additional challenges associated with the conduct of business overseas 
for example we may have difficulty managing and administering a globally dispersed business  fluctuations in exchange rates may negatively affect our operating results  we have to comply with a wide variety of foreign laws  we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks overseas due to the uncertainty of laws and enforcement in certain countries relating to the protection of intellectual property rights  export controls and times of crisis could prevent us from shipping our products into and from some markets  changes in import export duties and quotas could affect the competitive pricing of our products and services and reduce our market share in some countries  and economic or political instability in some international markets could result in the forfeiture of some foreign assets and the loss of sums spent developing and marketing those assets 
risks related to legal uncertainty we could be prevented from selling or developing our products if the gnu general public license and similar licenses under which our products are developed and licensed are not enforceable 
the linux kernel and the red hat linux operating system have been developed and licensed under the gnu general public license and similar open source licenses 
these licenses state that any program licensed under them may be liberally copied  modified and distributed 
we know of no circumstance under which these licenses have been challenged or interpreted in court 
accordingly  it is possible that a court would hold these licenses to be unenforceable in the event that someone were to file a claim asserting proprietary rights in a program developed and distributed under them 
any ruling by a court that these licenses are not enforceable  or that linux based operating systems  or significant portions of them  may not be liberally copied  modified or distributed  would have the effect of preventing us from selling or developing our products 
our subscription based distribution model is unproven and may encounter customer resistance 
the subscription agreement for red hat enterprise linux requires customers to agree to a subscription for red hat s systems management services for each machine on which they deploy red hat enterprise linux 
at the same time  the subscription agreement places no restriction on the customers right to redistribute red hat enterprise linux 
while we believe this practice fully complies with the requirements of the gnu general public license and while we have reviewed this practice with the free software foundation  we may still encounter customer resistence to this distribution model 
to the extent we are unsuccessful in promoting or defending this distribution model  we may fail to meet our revenue objectives 
our products may contain defects that may be costly to correct  delay market acceptance of our products and expose us to litigation 
despite testing by ourselves and our customers  errors have been and may continue to be found in our products after commencement of commercial shipments 
this risk is exacerbated by the fact that much of the code in our products is developed by independent parties over whom we exercise no supervision or control 
if errors are discovered  we may have to make significant expenditures of capital to eliminate them and yet may not be able to successfully correct them in a timely manner or at all 
errors and failures in our products could result in a loss of  or delay in  market acceptance of our products and could damage our reputation and our ability to convince commercial users of the benefits of linux based operating systems and other open source software products 
in addition  failures in our products could cause system failures for our customers who may assert warranty and other claims for substantial damages against us 
although our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  it is possible that these provisions may not be effective or enforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions 
our insurance policies may not adequately limit our exposure to this type of claim 
these claims  even if unsuccessful  could be costly and time consuming to defend 
we are vulnerable to claims that our products infringe third party intellectual property rights particularly because our products are comprised of distinct software components many of which are developed by independent parties 
we may be exposed to future litigation based on claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
this risk is exacerbated by the fact that much of the code in our products is developed by independent parties over whom we exercise no supervision or control 
it is further exacerbated by our lack of access to unpublished software patent applications  copyright registrations which fail to adequately disclose source code  and numerous issued software patents that are of dubious validity 
claims of infringement could require us to reengineer our products or seek to obtain licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products 
defending infringement claims  even claims without significant merit  can be expensive 
an adverse legal decision affecting our intellectual property  or the use of significant resources to defend against this type of claim  could place a significant strain on our financial resources and harm our reputation 
our efforts to protect our trademarks may not be adequate to prevent third parties from misappropriating our intellectual property rights 
our most valuable intellectual property is our collection of trademarks 
the protective steps we have taken in the past have been  and may in the future continue to be  inadequate to deter misappropriation of our trademark rights 
although we do not believe that we have suffered any material harm from misappropriation to date  we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of  or take appropriate steps to enforce  our trademark rights 
we have registered some of our trademarks in the americas  europe  asia and australia and have other trademark applications pending in each of those regions 
effective trademark protection may not be available in every country in which we offer or intend to offer our products and services 
failure to adequately protect our trademark rights could damage or even destroy the red hat brand and impair our ability to compete effectively 
furthermore  defending or enforcing our trademark rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 
risks related to the market for our common stock our stock price continues to be volatile and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above your purchase price 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  new products or services offered by red hat or our competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  conditions or trends in the internet  linux and software industries  changes in the economic performance and or market valuations of other internet  linux and software industries  announcements by ourselves or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  sales of common stock  and other events or factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock market  and the nasdaq national market and the market for internet related and technology companies in particular  has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
in addition  broad market and industry factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies 
such litigation  if instituted  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of red hat s investment activities is to preserve principal and liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  the company maintains its portfolio of cash equivalents  short term and long term investments in a variety of highly rated fixed income securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
the following table presents the fair value balances of the company s cash equivalents and short term and long term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of february  in thousands year ending february  february  february  february  february  total cash equivalents average interest rate investments average interest rates red hat did not hold derivative financial instruments as of february   and has never held such investments in the past 
foreign currency risk approximately of the company s fiscal revenues were generated by sales outside the united states 
the company is exposed to significant risks of foreign currency fluctuation primarily from receivables denominated in foreign currency and are subject to transaction gains and losses  which are recorded as a component in determining net income 
additionally  the assets and liabilities of the company s non us operations are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect as of the applicable balance sheet dates  and the revenues and expenses of these operations are translated at average exchange rates during the month the transactions occur
