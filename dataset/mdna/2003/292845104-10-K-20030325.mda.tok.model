for a discussion of the company s critical accounting policies  see page results of operations net sales were billion in  compared with billion in and billion in net earnings were million per share in  compared with million per share in and million per share in excluding certain items reported in and  the company would have reported net earnings of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
management believes the amounts as adjusted better reflect the core earnings of the company 
the following table reconciles the company s net earnings as adjusted with reported net earnings in millions net earnings as adjusted plug power inc investment impairment equity investment impairment special credit charge  net see note net gains on asset sales net earnings as reported the information in the discussion of each segment s results is derived directly from the internal financial reporting system used for management purposes 
items allocated to each segment s results include the majority of corporate operating charges 
unallocated items include interest expense  interest income  royalty income  sale of precious metals accounted for under the last in  first out lifo method  certain special and other charges  income taxes  certain information technology development costs and other miscellaneous corporate items 
environmental technologies the environmental technologies segment markets cost effective compliance with environmental regulations enabled by sophisticated emission control technologies and systems 
performance sales increased to million  and operating earnings decreased to million 
discussion the majority of this segment s sales and operating earnings are derived from technologies to control pollution from mobile sources  including gasoline and diesel powered passenger cars  sport utility vehicles  trucks  buses and off road vehicles 
sales increased primarily from the addition of higher pass through substrate costs of million  an estimated increase in worldwide production of light duty vehicles and higher volumes in both oem and retrofit diesel markets 
higher sales were reduced by million on lower volumes of emission control systems for gas turbines used in power generation applications and by million on lower volumes to the surface coatings markets 
operating earnings decreased primarily from higher expenses of million associated with rework for power generation applications  higher depreciation  depletion and amortization costs of million  a manufacturing consolidation charge of million recorded in and higher research and development costs of million 
outlook this segment expects growth in sales and operating earnings as emission control regulations become stricter around the world and address a much broader range of emission sources 
demand from the automotive market is expected to remain strong in response to the company s development of several new technologies 
although auto builds are forecasted to be down slightly in  ongoing productivity improvements and increased demand in asia are expected to support modest growth in this portion of the segment 
a significant decline in auto builds could have an unfavorable effect on this segment  depending on the demand for platforms where the segment provides catalysts 
stationary source comparisons are expected to be unfavorable for catalysts for emission control systems for gas turbines used in peak power generation applications from higher sales a year ago and a decline in demand 
demand is expected to remain soft for technologies related to peak power generation due to the current lack of funding for these projects 
sales of advanced catalysts for medium and heavy duty diesel trucks increased in the second half of and are expected to expand in as new regulations begin to take effect 
investment in research for medium and heavy duty diesel continues at an accelerated pace in anticipation of more stringent regulations scheduled to begin phasing in during and this segment continues to work to reduce its reliance on the automotive market by developing an array of applications not only for medium and heavy duty diesel markets  but also for non automotive markets  including technologies for motorcycles  small engines  such as lawn and garden power equipment  charbroilers  mining and construction  and ozone management 
compared with sales increased to million  and operating earnings increased to million 
excluding the impact of special and other charges of million in  operating earnings increased 
discussion excluding the impact of special and other charges in sales and operating earnings from technologies to control pollution from mobile sources increased and  respectively 
in spite of a decline in production of light duty vehicles in both north america and europe  earnings increased primarily from higher volumes of auto emission catalysts in north america 
sales and earnings also were favorably impacted by strength in the segment s non automotive markets  primarily from increased volumes of emission control systems for gas turbines used in peak power generation 
these increases were partly offset by the absence of operating earnings of million from the segment s metal joining products business sold in september and million from the segment s silver nitrate business sold in february excluding the results of these dispositions  sales and operating earnings would have increased and  respectively 
process technologies the process technologies segment enables customers to make their processes more productive  efficient  environmentally sound and safer through the supply of advanced chemical process catalysts  additives and sorbents 
performance sales decreased to million  and operating earnings decreased to million 
discussion sales and operating earnings were lower in primarily from lower volumes to the chemical process and petroleum refining markets 
these decreases were partially offset by increased demand for lynx trademark polypropylene catalysts  naphthamax trademark refining catalysts and petroleum refining additives which aggregated million  plus the full year inclusion of the fats and oils catalyst business acquired from sud chemie in october and the introduction of a new gas to liquids catalyst in sales also were reduced by million due to lower precious metal prices  which are passed through to chemical process catalyst customers in europe 
operating earnings were favorably impacted by lower energy and raw material costs of million  the elimination of goodwill amortization of million related to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  full year inclusion of results from the fats and oils catalyst business acquired from sud chemie in october of million and favorable impact of foreign exchange of million 
outlook sales and earnings growth in this segment are expected to come from custom process catalysts such as those that enable conversion of gas to liquids  high value add petroleum refining catalysts primarily naphthamax trademark and flextec trademark  petroleum refining additives  and increased market penetration for polypropylene catalysts 
continued cost management  productivity improvements and product technology advances will also contribute to earnings growth 
capacity expansion of a polyolefin catalyst plant will come online in overall weakness in the chemical process market and relatively flat demand in the petroleum refining market are expected to continue for most of compared with sales of million in were essentially unchanged compared with the same period in  and operating earnings increased to million 
excluding the impact of special and other charges of million in  operating earnings increased 
discussion excluding the impact of special and other charges in sales were unchanged compared with as higher volumes to chemical process and petroleum refining markets were offset by significantly lower precious metal prices  which are passed through to chemical process catalyst customers in europe 
excluding the impact of these pass through metal costs  sales would have increased on higher volumes and prices 
the higher volumes were driven by strong demand for lynx trademark catalyst used in the production of polypropylene and naphthamax trademark  which enables petroleum refiners to increase gasoline yields 
the increase in operating earnings was driven primarily from higher sales volumes that favorably impacted earnings by million  reduced costs from productivity improvements of million  the full year inclusion of results from the polyolefin catalyst business of targor gmbh acquired in september and moderate price increases of million 
earnings in were held back by higher energy and raw material costs of million 
appearance and performance technologies the appearance and performance technologies segment provides pigments  effect materials and performance additives that enable its customers to market enhanced image and functionality in their products 
this segment serves a broad array of end markets including coatings  plastics  cosmetics  construction and paper 
this segment s products help customers improve the look  performance and overall cost of their products 
this segment is also the internal supply source of precursors for some of the company s advanced refining process catalysts 
performance sales increased to million  and operating earnings increased to million 
discussion sales and operating earnings were up primarily from increased sales volumes to the coatings  automotive  agricultural  cosmetics personal care and plastics markets 
operating earnings were also favorably impacted by lower costs from productivity improvements of million  the elimination of goodwill amortization of million related to the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  lower energy costs of million  the recording of a million charge in relating to asset redeployment actions and productivity initiatives  and selective price increases in the paper market in the range of three to four percent 
outlook earnings growth within this segment is expected to increase at more normal rates as compared to the exceptional growth experienced in  which was driven by modest sales increases and significant productivity improvements  compared to weak results reported in sales growth is expected to be somewhat improved over the prior year as slow economic recovery is expected in most of the major markets served 
sales to the paper market are expected to increase gradually with earnings again being favorably impacted by industry wide price increases and continued productivity improvements 
higher natural gas costs could have an unfavorable impact on earnings 
efforts to focus on higher value end markets and customers for kaolin based technologies will continue to be a priority 
sales and earnings to other major markets served  including coatings  cosmetics personal care  automotive and agriculture  are expected to grow from ongoing new product development and new market applications plus market diversification opportunities through expansion of the segment s technology bases 
productivity improvement opportunities throughout the business will continue to be an important driver of increased earnings 
compared with sales decreased to million  and operating earnings increased to million 
excluding the impact of special and other charges of million in  operating earnings decreased 
discussion excluding the impact of special and other charges in declines in this segment s sales and operating earnings resulted from weak end markets and significantly higher energy costs of million 
most notable was the paper market  where weak pigment demand and industry overcapacity kept prices at depressed levels 
markets for special effect materials were mixed as lower volumes for technologies used in automotive finishes were partially offset by higher demand for those utilized in cosmetics 
materials services the materials services segment serves the company s technology segments  their customers and others with precious and base metals and related services 
this is a distribution and materials services business that purchases and sells precious metals  base metals and related products and services 
it does so under a variety of pricing and delivery arrangements structured to meet the logistical  financial and price risk management requirements of the company  its customers and suppliers 
additionally  it offers the related services of precious metal refining and storage and produces salts and solutions 
performance sales decreased to billion  and operating earnings decreased to million 
discussion sales for this segment include substantially all of the company s sales of metals to industrial customers of all segments 
sales also include fees invoiced for services rendered eg  refining and handling charges 
because of the logistical and hedging nature of much of this business and the significant precious metal values included in both sales and cost of sales  gross margins tend to be low in relation to the company s other technology businesses as does capital employed 
this effect also dampens the gross margin percentages of the company as a whole  but improves the return on investment 
while most customers for the company s platinum group metal catalysts purchase the metal from materials services  some choose to deliver metal from other sources prior to the manufacture of the catalysts 
in such cases  precious metal values are not included in sales 
the mix of such arrangements and the extent of market price fluctuations can significantly affect the reported level of sales and cost of sales 
consequently  there is no direct correlation between year to year changes in reported sales and operating earnings 
operating earnings were down as a result of lower volumes and lower results from the recycling refining of platinum group metals of million 
operating earnings in both years were favorably affected by several items that triggered recognition of events reflecting operations from prior periods 
in  operating earnings were favorably impacted by million of income related to platinum group metal transactions realized previously but deferred pending the resolution of certain contractual provisions  an insurance settlement gain million  the receipt of cash related to the settlement of litigation for a customer receivable recorded in that was previously written off million and million from the realization of a previously unrecognized contractual benefit 
in  operating earnings were favorably impacted by the recovery of metal from an unexpected industrial customer bankruptcy million and the restructuring of a professional services contract million 
sales decreased from lower platinum group metal prices and lower volumes 
outlook the results of this segment are likely to be below recent historical levels rather than the exceptional results reported in and the higher levels of overall weakness projected in the basic industrial markets will adversely impact the recycling and refining of platinum group metals  as well as the volume of metal sales 
uncertainty also exists with respect to the volume and customer mix impact of a change in producer channels to market 
while a sustainable level of base business is anticipated  the benefits of potential market volatility combined with other market factors represents an upside for this segment 
volatility not only increases the spreads on transactions  but also provides opportunities to benefit from strong and prudent physical positions see the commodity price risk section on page for further details 
compared with sales decreased to billion  and operating earnings decreased to million 
discussion operating earnings and sales were down due to significantly lower platinum group metal prices and lower volumes 
the decrease in earnings was partially offset by increased earnings in the recycling refining of platinum group metals of million and the reversal of certain expense accruals that are no longer necessary due to the recovery of metal from an unexpected industrial customer bankruptcy million and the restructuring of a professional services contract million 
acquisitions other party business arrangement transaction date business opportunity shuozhou anpeak kaolin co  ltd

the decrease in was primarily driven by lower margins earned in the materials services segment 
sales from this segment decreased in to billion and provided a gross profit of  while sales from all other reportable segments decreased to billion and provided a gross profit of 
as described earlier  the lower margins on materials services sales are driven by the inclusion of the value of precious metals in both sales and cost of sales 
selling  administrative and other expenses selling  administrative and other expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in was primarily due to increased information technology expenses of million  increased research and development expenses of million  increased administrative rent expenses of million and increased professional fees of million 
the decrease in was primarily due to the absence of special and other charges of million reported in and lower compensation costs 
equity earnings absent the impairment charge discussed below  equity in earnings of affiliates was million in  compared with equity earnings of million in and million in the decrease was primarily from lower earnings from engelhard clal  a owned precious metal fabrication joint venture  from gains reported in the prior year related to a change in the mix of platinum group metals used in its operations and lower volumes due to the absence of divested business units 
the increase in was primarily due to higher earnings from engelhard clal primarily on gains related to a change in the mix of platinum group metals used in its operations 
higher equity earnings were also reported in for heesung engelhard  a owned environmental catalyst joint venture in south korea 
in the third quarter of  the company recorded an impairment charge of million associated with its engelhard clal joint venture see note  investments  for further detail 
loss gain on investments  net in the second quarter of  the company recorded an impairment charge of million million after tax associated with its plug power inc investment see note  investments  for further detail 
in the first quarter of  the company recorded a loss of million million after tax associated with the divestiture of the international dioxide  inc business unit 
in the third quarter of  the company sold its metal joining products business located in warwick  rhode island and recorded a gain of million million after tax 
interest interest expense was million in  compared with million in and million in interest expense in and decreased due to decreased borrowings and lower short term interest rates 
interest income was million in  million in and million in the company capitalized interest of million in and  and million in taxes the worldwide income tax expense was million in  compared with million in and million in the effective income tax rate was in excluding the equity investment impairment of million  in and in the decrease in the worldwide effective tax rate in was primarily the result of higher percentage depletion deductions 
additionally  the rate was favorably impacted by the recognition of foreign tax items and research and development tax credits in excess of previous estimates  and a shift in the geographical mix of earnings 
the decrease in the worldwide effective tax rate in was primarily due to the recognition of foreign tax credits generated in previous years and the recognition of favorable tax variances from the foreign sales corporation and percentage depletion deductions see note  income taxes  for further detail of variances 
net deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable 
their utilization is dependent upon the ability to generate the appropriate types of income eg  foreign source income in the periods in which temporary differences turnaround or in periods prior to the expiration of applicable carryforward items 
financial condition and liquidity working capital was million at december   compared with a deficit of million at december  the current ratio was in and in the year end market value of the company s precious metals accounted for under the lifo method exceeded carrying cost by million at december   compared with million at december  the decrease in excess value reflects lower market values and the impact of slightly reduced inventory levels see note  inventories  for further detail 
the company s total debt decreased to million at december  from million at december  the percentage of total debt to total capitalization decreased to at december  from at december   primarily due to decreased borrowings and increased retained earnings 
the company currently has a million  five year committed credit facility that expires in may and a million  day committed credit facility that expires in may  with a group of major us and overseas banks 
unused  uncommitted lines of credit were million at december  the company has filed a shelf registration for million of corporate debt 
plans to issue long term debt in are under consideration by management 
operating activities provided net cash of million in compared with million in and million in the variance in cash flows from operating activities primarily occurred in the materials services segment and reflects changes in metal positions used to facilitate requirements of the company  its metal customers and suppliers see note  supplemental information  for materials services variances 
materials services routinely enters into a variety of arrangements for the sourcing of metals 
generally  transactions are hedged on a daily basis see note  summary of significant accounting policies  for further detail 
hedging is accomplished primarily through forward  future and option contracts 
however  in closely monitored situations for which exposure levels have been set by senior management  the company from time to time holds large unhedged industrial commodity positions that are subject to future market price fluctuations 
these positions are included in committed metal positions along with hedged metal holdings 
the bulk of hedged metal obligations represent spot short positions 
as these positions generate cash  their cash effect is included in the financing activities section of the company s consolidated statements of cash flows 
other than in closely monitored situations  these positions are hedged with forward purchases 
in addition  the aggregate fair value of derivatives in a loss position are reported in hedged metal obligations derivatives in a gain position are included in committed metal positions 
materials services works to ensure that the company and its customers have an uninterrupted source of metals  primarily platinum group metals  utilizing supply contracts and commodities markets around the world 
committed metal positions include significant advances made for the purchase of precious metals that have been delivered to the company but for which the final purchase price has not yet been determined see discussion in credit risk section on page for further detail 
the variance in cash flows from investing activities is primarily related to changes in capital expenditures  proceeds received from the sale of the company s metal joining products business in september  the acquisition of certain operating assets of shuozhou anpeak kaolin co  ltd 
in november  the acquisition of the fats and oils catalyst business of sud chemie in october and the acquisition of the targor polyolefin catalyst business in september the variance in cash flows from financing activities was impacted by the repayment of long term debt in and  cash received from the exercise of stock options  particularly in  a change in hedged metal obligations in and increased purchases of treasury stock in and the following table represents the company s contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in millions short term borrowings accounts payable hedged metal obligations long term debt operating leases total contractual obligations in the normal course of business  the company incurs obligations with regard to contract completion and product performance 
under certain circumstances  these obligations are supported through the issuance of letters of credit 
at december   the aggregate outstanding amount of letters of credit supporting such obligations amounted to million  of which million will expire in less than one year of which million will not be renewed  million will expire in two to three years  million will expire in four to five years  and million will expire after five years 
in the opinion of management  such obligations will not significantly affect the company s financial position or results of operations as the company anticipates fulfilling its performance obligations 
at december   the company did not have any guarantees of any unconsolidated subsidiary obligations 
the company has consistently derived considerable cash flow from operations  which has been used  along with both short and long term debt  to pay for capital expenditures  acquisitions  dividends and other corporate requirements 
the continuation of these levels of cash flow is expected  but is subject to the risk factors listed elsewhere in this report particularly in the forward looking statements section on page 
in addition  the company has always maintained investment grade credit ratings that it considers important for cost effective and ready access to the credit markets 
management fully expects to be able to obtain future funding from both short and long term debt for cash requirements in excess of cash flow from operations 
in the event that any of these sources prove to be below expectations  the company has access to committed lines of credit aggregating million as of december  management intends to renew million of this committed line of credit that expires in may credit risk the company believes that its financial instruments do not represent a concentration of credit risk because the company deals with a variety of major banks worldwide and its accounts receivable are spread among a number of major industries  customers and geographic areas 
a centralized credit committee reviews significant credit transactions and risk management issues before granting of credit  and an appropriate level of reserves is maintained 
in addition  the company monitors the financial condition of its customers to help ensure collections and to minimize losses 
the company may enter into transactions in which it advances funds after receipt of metal as provisional payment for the metal which is to be finally priced under market based pricing formulae that will result in a determination of that price 
if the final price is less than the provisional price paid  the supplier will be obligated to return the difference to the company 
therefore  if the market price and the anticipated final price falls below the provisional price  the company is exposed to the potential credit risk associated with the possibility of non payment by the supplier  although no payment is due until after the final price is determined 
as of december   the aggregate market value of metals purchased under a contract for which a provisional price had been paid had fallen below the amounts advanced by a total of million 
this excess may grow or may be eliminated based on market price changes 
in march an agreement was reached that  when performed  including receipt of cash by the company which is anticipated before the end of the second quarter  will result in the elimination of this excess 
the company expects that no loss will be incurred due to non performance 
capital expenditures  commitments and contingencies capital projects are designed to maintain capacity  expand operations  improve efficiency or protect the environment 
capital expenditures amounted to million in  million in and million in capital expenditures in are expected to be approximately million

critical accounting policies certain key policies are explained below to assist in understanding the company s consolidated financial statements 
more detailed explanations may be found elsewhere in the md a section and in note  summary of significant accounting policies 
sales a significant portion of consolidated net sales represent the sale of platinum group metals to industrial customers who buy the metals from materials services in connection with products manufactured by the environmental and process technologies segments 
accordingly  almost all of these sales are reported in the materials services segment  with a limited amount included in environmental and process technologies reported sales 
because metal price levels may vary widely  there is no consistent relationship between consolidated sales and gross profit 
because the timing of the purchase of spot metals often does not coincide with the timing of the subsequent sales to industrial users  materials services needs to hedge price risk  usually by selling forward ie  for future delivery to investment grade trading entities  industrial companies or on futures exchanges 
if a surplus of physical metal develops  materials services may also sell spot and buy forward to balance the risk position 
other than hedges entered into with industrial customers  sales related to these hedging transactions are not included in reported sales  as they are not meaningful in an industrial context 
customers of the environmental and process technologies segments who purchase products that improve efficiency and yields are often unable to precisely predict the dates that catalysts will be required 
accordingly  they may request that product that has already been ordered  manufactured and prepared for shipment at the agreed upon date be temporarily held by the company until that customer s manufacturing facility is prepared to accept the new charge of catalyst 
in cases where the customer requests the company to hold the goods  agrees to be invoiced and to pay the invoices on normal terms as well as to accept title to the goods  the company will recognize the sale prior to shipment 
great care is exercised to make sure that these sales are only recognized in accordance with the applicable revenue recognition guidance 
mark to market materials services procures physical metal from third parties for resale and enters into forward contracts and other relatively straight forward hedging derivatives that are recorded as either assets or liabilities at their fair value 
by acting in its capacity as a distributor and materials service provider to the company s technology businesses and their customers and by taking closely monitored unhedged positions as described below  materials services takes on the attributes of a dealer in metals 
both spot metal and derivative instruments used in hedging ie  forwards  futures  swaps and options are stated at fair value 
the company values platinum  palladium  gold and silver based on the daily closing nymex settlement prices 
there are no so called terminal markets for rhodium  ruthenium and iridium  so the company s own published industrial bullion eib prices are used 
however  these are compared to other reference prices published in metals week  an independent trade journal 
values for base metals come from the closing prices of the lme london metals exchange 
in closely monitored situations  for which exposure levels and transaction size limits have been set by senior management  the company holds unhedged metal positions that are subject to future market fluctuations 
such positions may include varying levels of derivative instruments 
at times  these positions can be significant 
all unhedged metal transactions are monitored and marked to market daily 
the portion of this metal that has not been hedged is therefore subject to price risk and is disclosed in note  committed metal positions and hedged metal obligations 
the fair values of materials services various spot and derivative positions are included in committed metal positions on the asset side of the consolidated balance sheet and hedged metal obligations on the liability side 
the credit performance risk associated with the fair value of derivatives in a gain position is greatly mitigated through the selection of investment grade counterparties 
precious metals most of the platinum group metals used by environmental and process technologies to manufacture products are provided in advance by the customers 
the customers often purchase these metals from materials services  but they may also be shipped in from other sources 
certain quantities of precious metals are carried at historical cost using the lifo method  which provides a better matching of current costs with current revenues 
because most of the metal was acquired some time ago  the market value of this metal  while fluctuating from year to year  has generally been substantially above cost 
while this excess of market over cost is useful in evaluating the consolidated balance sheet from a credit perspective  the annual changes are not reflected in the income statement except to the extent that periodic liquidations of lifo layers produce book profits 
lifo liquidation profits are separately disclosed and not included in the operating earnings of the technology segments 
kaolin mining operations in order to provide kaolin based products to the company s customers and the process technologies segment  the company engages in kaolin mining operations that are integrated into the manufacturing processes 
the company owns and leases land containing kaolin deposits on a long term basis 
the company does not own any mining reserves or conduct any mining operations with respect to platinum  palladium or other metals 
the kaolin mining process includes exploration  topsoil and overburden removal  extraction of kaolin and the subsequent reclamation of mined areas 
in order to match the costs of the mining process with revenues associated with kaolin based products  certain mining process costs are expensed by the company over the life of the related estimated mineable reserves 
pensions and other postretirement postemployment costs the company s employee pension and other postretirement postemployment benefit costs and obligations are dependent on its assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  salary growth  expected returns on plan assets  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
the discount rate assumption is based on investment yields available at the company s measurement date of september on aa rated corporate long term bond yields 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook  and an assessment of likely long term trends 
retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
mortality rates are based on published data 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement postemployment benefit costs and obligations 
based on a review of the current environment  we have lowered our long term rate of return assumption from in to in in  we have further lowered this assumption to 
the company has determined that its net pension cost is projected to be approximately million in  compared to million in and million in the plan assets have earned a rate of return substantially less than in the last two years 
should this trend continue  the company would be required to reconsider its assumed expected rate of return on plan assets 
if the company were to lower this rate  future pension expense would likely increase 
see note  benefits  for further detail regarding costs and assumptions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive transactions the company is exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
in the normal course of business  the company uses a variety of techniques and instruments  including derivatives  as part of its overall risk management strategy 
the company enters into derivative agreements with a diverse group of major financial and other institutions with individually determined credit limits to reduce exposure to the risk of nonperformance by counterparties 
interest rate risk the company uses a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk of its debt related financial instruments and derivatives 
market risk is defined here as the potential change in the fair value of debt resulting from an adverse movement in interest rates 
the fair value of the company s total debt was million at december  and million at december  based on average market quotations of price and yields provided by investment banks 
a basis point increase in interest rates could result in a reduction in the fair value of total debt of million at december  compared with million at december  the company also uses interest rate derivatives to help achieve its fixed and floating rate debt objectives 
in  the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of million to effectively change a fixed rate debt obligation into a floating rate obligation 
the total notional amount of these agreements is equal to the face value of the designated debt instrument 
the swap agreements are expected to settle in august  the maturity date of the corresponding debt issuance 
approximately and of the company s borrowings had variable interest rates as of december  and  respectively 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company uses a variety of strategies  including foreign currency forward contracts  to minimize or eliminate foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with substantially all of its foreign currency transactions  including metal related transactions denominated in other than us dollars 
the company uses a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with its foreign currency transactions 
market risk is defined here as the potential change in fair value resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
a adverse movement in foreign currency rates could result in a net loss of million at december  compared with million at december  on the company s foreign currency forward contracts 
however  since the company limits the use of foreign currency derivatives to the hedging of contractual and anticipated foreign currency payables and receivables  this loss in fair value for those instruments generally would be offset by a gain in the value of the underlying payable or receivable 
a adverse movement in foreign currency rates could result in an unrealized loss of million at december  compared with million at december  on the company s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates 
however  since the company views these investments as long term  the company would not expect such a loss to be realized in the near term 
commodity price risk in closely monitored situations  for which exposure levels and transaction size limits have been set by senior management  the company from time to time holds large  unhedged industrial commodity positions that are subject to market price fluctuations 
such positions may include varying levels of derivative commodity instruments 
all unhedged industrial commodity transactions are monitored and marked to market daily 
all other industrial commodity transactions are hedged on a daily basis  using forward  future  option or swap contracts to substantially eliminate the exposure to price risk 
these positions are also marked to market daily 
the company performed a value at risk analysis on all of its metal related commodity assets and liabilities 
the value at risk calculation is a statistical model that uses historical price and volatility data to predict market risk on a one day interval with a confidence level 
while the value at risk models are relatively sophisticated  the quantitative information generated is limited by the historical information used in the calculation
