the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  income taxes  financing operations  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
inventory the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
sales returns and allowances the company s ability to collect factor chargebacks for deductions taken from its customers for returns  discounts  and allowances as well as potential future customer deductions is significant to its operations 
the company reserves against known chargebacks as well as potential future customer deductions  based on a combination of historical activity and current market conditions 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  which may have a significant impact on the company s results 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
these customers include non factored accounts and credit card receivables from third party service providers 
if the financial conditions of these customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  the company is involved in and subject to compliance and regulatory reviews and audits by numerous authorities  agencies and other governmental agents and entities from various jurisdictions 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes of these matters 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these reviews are made after careful analysis of each individual issue

those gains and losses on contracts that are not deemed effective hedges are immediately adjusted through income 
at december   the unrealized gain on these outstanding forward contracts is approximately  net of taxes 
the company expects to continue to routinely enter into additional foreign exchange contracts throughout the year 
while the company believes that its current procedures with respect to the reduction of risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations are adequate  there can be no assurance that such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the company in the future 
inventory from contract manufacturers in the far east and brazil are purchased in united states dollars and the recent changes of many of these currencies against the united states dollar has not had any material adverse impact on the company 
however  future purchase prices for the company s products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturer  which may affect the company s cost of goods in the future 
the company does not believe the potential effects of such fluctuations would have a material adverse effect on the company 
effects of inflation the company does not believe that the relatively low rates of inflation experienced over the last few years in the united states  where it primarily competes  have had a significant effect on revenues or profitability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not believe it has a material exposure to market risk 
the company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risks with respect to its inventory transactions denominated in euro 
during the second half of  the company converted all of its lira transactions to the euro and effectively ceased conducting business with the italian lira currency 
business activities in various currencies expose the company to the risk that the eventual net dollar cash flows from transactions with foreign suppliers denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected by changes in currency rates 
the company manages these risks by utilizing foreign exchange contracts 
the company does not enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes 
at december   the company had forward exchange contracts totaling with notional values million  which resulted in an unrealized gain of approximately  net of taxes 
the company s earnings may also be effected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of borrowings under its line of credit facility 
a two or less percentage point increase in interest rates effecting the company s credit facility would not have had a material effect on the company s and net income
