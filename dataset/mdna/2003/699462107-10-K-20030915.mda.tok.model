perceptive is a majority owned subsidiary of the company 
as of june   the company owned an approximate interest in perceptive 
the company conducts a significant portion of its operations in foreign countries 
approximately and of the company s service revenue for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  were from non us operations 
because the company s financial statements are denominated in us dollars  changes in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on its operating results 
for the fiscal year ended june   approximately of total service revenue was denominated in british pounds and approximately of total service revenue was denominated in euros 
for the fiscal year ended june   approximately of total service revenue was denominated in british pounds and approximately of total service revenue was denominated in euros 
as a result of the weakened us dollar against the british pound and the euro in fiscal year  the company s revenues and the company s costs increased in from the comparable periods due to these exchange rate fluctuations 
approximately of the company s contracts are fixed price  with some variable components  and range in duration from a few months to several years 
cash flow from these contracts typically consists of a down payment required to be paid at the time of contract execution with the balance due in installments over the contract s duration  usually on a milestone achievement basis 
revenue from these contracts is generally recognized as work is performed 
as a result  cash receipts do not necessarily correspond to costs incurred and revenue recognized on contracts 
generally  the company s clients can terminate their contracts with the company upon thirty to sixty days notice or can delay execution of services 
clients may terminate or delay contracts for a variety of reasons  including  among others merger or potential merger related activities involving the client  the failure of products being tested to satisfy safety requirements or efficacy criteria  unexpected or undesired clinical results of the product  client cost reductions as a result of budgetary limits or changing priorities  the client s decision to forego a particular study  insufficient patient enrollment or investigator recruitment  or production problems resulting in shortages of the product 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report  the company believes that the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results 
revenue service revenue on fixed price contracts is recognized as services are performed 
the company measures progress for fixed price contracts using the concept of proportional performance based upon a direct labor cost to cost methodology or by the unit based output method 
these methods require the company to estimate total expected revenue and total expected costs 
generally  the assigned financial manager or financial analyst reviews contract estimates on a monthly basis 
adjustments to contract estimates are made in the periods in which the facts that require the revisions become known 
historically  there have not been any significant variations between contract estimates and the actual costs incurred  which were not recovered from clients 
in the event that future estimates are materially incorrect  they could materially impact the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
billed accounts receivable  unbilled accounts receivable and deferred revenue billed accounts receivable represent amounts for which invoices have been sent to clients 
unbilled accounts receivable represent amounts recognized as revenue for which invoices have not yet been sent to clients 
deferred revenue represents amounts billed or payments received for which revenue has not yet been earned 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historic collectability and specific identification of potential problem accounts 
in the event the company is unable to collect portions of its outstanding billed or unbilled receivables  there may be a material impact to the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position 
income taxes the company s global provision for corporate income taxes is calculated using the tax accounting rules established by sfas no 
income tax expense is based on the distribution of profit before tax amongst the various taxing jurisdictions in which the company operates  adjusted as required by the tax laws of each taxing jurisdiction 
changes in the distribution of profits and losses between taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on the company s effective tax rate 
the provision is a combination of current year tax liability and future tax liability benefit that results from differences between book and taxable income that will reverse in future periods 
deferred tax assets and liabilities for these future tax effects are established on the company s balance sheet 
a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that future tax benefits will not be realized 
monthly interim tax provision calculations are prepared during the year 
differences between these interim estimates and the final results for the year could materially impact the company s effective tax rate and its consolidated results of operations and financial position 
employee stock compensation the company elected to follow accounting principal board opinion no 
 accounting for stock options issued to employees apb  and related interpretations in accounting for the company s employee stock options because the alternative fair value accounting provided for under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
under apb  no compensation expense is recognized if the exercise price equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant 
if parexel accounted for stock options under sfas  the company would have recorded additional compensation expense for stock option grants to employees 
if parexel were unable to account for stock options under abp  the company s financial results would be materially affected to the extent that additional compensation expense had to be recognized 
the additional compensation expense could vary significantly from period to period based on several factors including the number of stock options granted and stock price and or interest rate fluctuations 
foreign currencies the company derives a large portion of its service revenue from operations in foreign countries 
the company s financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  factors associated with international operations  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  could significantly affect the company s results of operations 
gains and losses on transactions denominated in currencies other than an entity s functional currency are reported in other income expense 
adjustments from the translation of the subsidiary entities foreign functional currencies to us dollars are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholder s equity 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill was amortized using the straight line method over the expected useful life 
subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing 
the company has assessed the impairment of goodwill under sfas no 
in fiscal years and based on this assessment  there was no impairment identified at june  and any future impairment of goodwill could have a material impact to the company s financial position or its results of operations

during the three month periods ended june  and december  the company recorded facilities related restructuring charges totaling million and million  respectively  as a result of changes in prior assumptions regarding certain leased facilities which were abandoned as part of the company s june restructuring 
the changes in prior assumptions were caused by a further deterioration in challenging real estate market conditions  which made it difficult to sub lease the abandoned facilities at previously estimated rental rates 
in june  the company made certain reasonable assumptions based upon market conditions  which indicated that sub lease payments for these abandoned facilities were probable 
the june restructuring charge involved fourteen properties 
the company has been successful in exiting or subleasing eleven of those properties 
after significant effort in trying to sub lease the remaining properties in a time of a declining commercial real estate market  it became apparent to the company during fiscal year that the original assumptions for the remaining three properties were no longer valid under current market conditions

the lines of credit are payable on demand and are supported by parexel international corporation 
at june   the company had approximately million available credit under these arrangements 
the company has a cash pooling arrangement with abn amro bank 
pooling occurs when debit balances are offset against credit balances and the net position is used as a basis by the bank for interest calculation 
each legal entity owned by the company and party to this arrangement remains the owner of either a credit or debit balance 
therefore  interest income is earned in legal entities with credit balances  while interest expense is charged in legal entities with debit balances 
based on the pool s overall balance  the bank than recalculates the overall interest to be charged or earned  compares this amount with the sum of already charged earned interest amounts per account and additionally pays charges the difference 
interest income and interest expense are recorded separately in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the company s primary cash needs are for the payment of salaries and fringe benefits  hiring and recruiting expenses  business development costs  acquisition related costs  capital expenditures  and facilities related expenses 
the company s principal source of cash is from contracts with clients 
if the company is unable to generate new contracts with existing and new clients and or if the level of contract cancellations increases  revenue and cash flow will be adversely affected see risk factors for further detail 
absent a material adverse change in the level of the company s new business bookings or contract cancellations  parexel believes that its existing capital resources together with cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under existing lines of credit will be sufficient to meet its foreseeable cash needs 
in the future  the company expects to consider acquiring businesses to enhance its service offerings  expand its therapeutic expertise  and or increase its global presence 
any such acquisitions may require additional external financing  and the company may from time to time seek to obtain funds from public or private issuance of equity or debt securities 
the company may be unable to secure such financing on terms acceptable to the company

the company may be subjected to foreign currency transaction risk when the company s foreign subsidiaries enter into contracts denominated in a currency other than the foreign subsidiary s functional local currency 
during fiscal years and  the company recorded foreign exchange losses of million and gains of million  respectively
