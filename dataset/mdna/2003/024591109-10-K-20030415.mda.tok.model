item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company s subsidiary  congoleum  is a defendant in a large number of asbestos related lawsuits and has announced its intent to file a pre packaged plan of reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code as part of its strategy to resolve this liability 
in addition  the company is a defendant in a number of asbestos related lawsuits as well 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated herein by reference 
these matters may have a material adverse impact on the company s or congoleum s financial position and results of operations 
based on its pre packaged bankruptcy strategy  abi s consolidated subsidiary congoleum has made provision in its financial statements for the minimum amount of the range of estimates for its contribution and costs to effect its plan to settle asbestos liabilities through a plan trust established under section g of the bankruptcy code 
congoleum recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of to increase its recorded liability to the estimated minimum of million 
actual amounts that will be contributed to the plan trust and costs for pursuing and implementing the plan of reorganization could be materially higher  which could have a material effect on abi s consolidated results of operations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million or from sales of million in the increase in sales was due to higher flooring segment sales  attributable to congoleum s durastone product line and higher jewelry segment sales 
jewelry sales increased as a result of sales of a line of licensed products acquired in july  as well as continued growth with a major mass merchandiser 
tape and canadian segment sales declined due to the poor economic environment in several of their end use markets 
cost of products sold was of net sales in  the same percentage as in within segments  gross margins were level with in the flooring and canada segments  and declined in tape due to competitive pressures and jewelry due to costs for the acquired line of licensed products 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of net sales  up from million or of net sales in of that increase of million  million was due to a charge by congoleum in to adjust its recorded liability for resolving asbestos related claims against it 
the liability recorded at december  represents the minimum estimated cost that congoleum will incur to resolve its asbestos related liability through the execution of congoleum s anticipated plan of reorganization 
actual costs could be significantly higher  and congoleum will adjust its recorded liability should its estimates change  which abi expects it would include in its consolidated results 
the remainder of the increase was primarily due to increased new product marketing costs at congoleum and higher selling expenses at k m related to increased sales 
in addition  all operations experienced cost increases for insurance and employee benefits 
interest income declined from 
million in to 
million in primarily due to lower rates on short term investments 
interest expense increased from million in to million in due to slightly higher average borrowings partly offset by slightly lower rates on certain loans 
other income increased from million in to million in as a result of gains on foreign exchange 
the provision for income taxes in was of pre tax income  compared with in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of the large loss at congoleum  where much of the loss is for reorganization costs  which are not deductible  and where tax benefit for deductible expenses is being offset by a valuation allowance as required under sfas net loss before a required accounting change was million in  compared to million net income in the majority of this change is due to the abi s share of congoleum s net losses 
the remainder of the change  which amounts to million  is due to improved results at k m  more than offset by weaker performance at janus flooring and the tape and canadian businesses 
the company recorded a non cash transitional charge of million in the first quarter of for impairment of goodwill that resulted from the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million or from sales in sales at the tape and canadian divisions declined as a result of economic conditions 
flooring product segment sales increased due to the inclusion of a full year of sales at janus  which was acquired in october sales at congoleum declined slightly 
jewelry sales increased due to the acquisition of a line of licensed products combined with growth in sales to existing and new customers 
cost of products sold was of net sales in  up from in this increase was primarily due to decreased sales volume and competitive pricing pressures affecting results at the tape and canadian divisions 
gross profit margins also declined slightly at k m due to a lower margin mix of sales 
gross profit margins improved at congoleum due to cost reductions  efficiency improvements  and a more profitable sales mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of net sales  up slightly from million  or of net sales  in the increase in these expenses was primarily due to the growth at k m arising from the licensed product lines acquired from swank  inc and the inclusion of a full year of expenses at janus 
selling  general and administrative expenses declined at the tape division and canadian division but increased as a percentage of sales due to the significant sales declines at both operations 
at congoleum  selling  general and administrative expenses declined in both amount and as a percent of sales due to cost reductions initiated in the first quarter of interest income declined from million in to million in due to lower average balances of cash equivalents and short term investments earning interest at lower rates 
other income increased from million in to million in primarily as a result of a million gain on the sale of a warehouse 
interest expense increased from million in to million in due to higher borrowings in the provision for income taxes in was of pre tax income  up from in the increase in the tax rate was primarily due to the fact that janus and congoleum  which had losses in  had lower effective tax rates than the other abi operations  which had income in as a result  the tax benefit provided for on these losses was less than the tax expense provided for on the income of the other operations 
the effect of expenses not deductible for tax purposes  which has a greater impact on the effective tax rate at lower levels of income  also contributed to the relatively high effective tax rate for net income for the year ended december  was million  down from million in income declined at the tape and canadian divisions 
janus incurred a loss in its first full year as part of abi 
the loss at congoleum was less than the loss in  which included non recurring charges for a change of distributor 
net income at k m increased 
liquidity and capital resources the company s subsidiary  congoleum  is a defendant in a large number of asbestos related lawsuits and has announced its intent to file a pre packaged plan of reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code as part of its strategy to resolve this liability 
in addition  the company is a defendant in a number of asbestos related lawsuits as well 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated herein by reference 
these matters may have a material adverse impact on the company s or congoleum s liquidity and capital resources 
during  congoleum paid million in defense and indemnity costs related to asbestos related claims 
in  congoleum anticipates spending at least million in fees  expenses  and contributions to effect its planned reorganization under chapter as part of congoleum s plan of reorganization  abi expects that its current and future asbestos claims related to its former tile division operations will be channeled to the trust established in connection with congoleum s chapter plan of reorganization  resolving abi s present and future asbestos liability relating to those former operations 
in return for this relief  abi expects to contribute  among other things  a note to the trust that would be established in connection with congoleum s chapter reorganization in an aggregate principal amount equal to at least of the equity value of congoleum  with payment of such contribution secured by a pledge by abi of of the common stock of congoleum 
abi does not expect the note contribution would have a material adverse effect on its liquidity or capital resources 
at december   consolidated working capital was million  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to  and the debt to equity ratio was to debt issued by congoleum accounts for million or of consolidated debt and is not guaranteed or otherwise secured by abi or its other subsidiaries 
net cash provided by operations during was million 
capital expenditures for are estimated to be approximately million 
capital expenditures generally cover normal replacement of machinery and equipment and process improvements 
in july  the company  through a canadian subsidiary  entered into a credit agreement providing a million canadian dollar us million capital loan and increasing an existing operating loan facility to million canadian dollars us million 
proceeds of the capital loan were used to fund acquisitions of property and equipment in canada 
the capital loan is payable in equal quarterly installments beginning february  and bears interest at 
the operating loan is payable on demand and bears interest at a floating rate which averaged at december  in the third quarter of  abi entered into a note purchase and private shelf agreement with prudential insurance company the prudential agreement 
under the terms of this agreement  abi borrowed million and used the proceeds to retire existing long term and revolving debt 
the notes bear interest at reducing to if a lower ratio of debt to ebitda as defined in the prudential agreement  is attained 
principal is repayable in five annual million installments beginning august  in september  abi entered into a new revolving credit agreement the revolving credit agreement 
this agreement provides for borrowings of up to million through september   with interest varying from libor plus to libor plus depending upon the company s leverage ratio  as defined 
effective december   abi amended its revolving credit agreement and the prudential agreement to make certain financial covenants less restrictive on abi 
abi anticipates it will require further amendments to the prudential agreement and the revolving credit agreement in to permit it to make the contemplated note contribution in connection with congoleum s plan of reorganization and  depending on future financial performance  to make certain financial covenants in those loan agreements less restrictive 
due to the anticipated need to amend these loan agreements  the company has classified the related liabilities as current in its financial statements 
american biltrite s lending agreements require that its investment in congoleum be accounted for under the equity method of accounting and not consolidated 
under the equity method  abi s net loss for the year ended december  would have been reduced  and its consolidated equity increased  by million  because congoleum s losses exceeded the amount of its equity 
future income or losses at congoleum will not affect abi s compliance with financial covenants in the prudential agreement and revolving credit agreement as currently defined 
in december  congoleum entered into a revolving credit facility  which expires in  that provides for borrowings up to million depending on levels of  and secured by  inventory and receivables 
in february  congoleum and its lender amended its revolving credit facility to permit congoleum to proceed with its planned strategy to resolve its asbestos liabilities through the filing of a pre packaged plan of reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
the amendment revised certain covenants and restrictions to reasonably accommodate the anticipated costs and actions contemplated by congoleum s strategy 
certain borrowing agreements of the company or its subsidiaries restrict the ability of the company or the borrowing subsidiary to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  or make capital expenditures  and require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and minimum net worth levels 
the covenants and conditions under those borrowing agreements must be met in order for the company to borrow under those agreements 
in addition  borrowings under congoleum s facility are based upon the amount of inventory and accounts receivable available as collateral 
these considerations could limit the company s ability to fully utilize the million available under its existing lines of credit 
at december   million was outstanding under these lines and million secured outstanding letters of credit 
cash requirements for capital expenditures  working capital  debt service  dividends and any share repurchases are expected to be financed from operating activities and borrowings under existing lines of credit 
the following table summarizes the company s obligations at december  for future principal payments on its long term debt assuming any necessary amendments or waivers are obtained from its lenders and future minimum rental payments on its noncancellable operating leases 
payments due by period amounts in thousands less than after total year years years years years years long term debt        operating leases        contingencies the company s subsidiary congoleum is a party to a significant number of lawsuits stemming from its manufacture of asbestos containing products and has announced its intent to seek confirmation of a pre packaged plan of reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code as part of its strategy to resolve this liability 
abi has recorded what it believes are adequate provisions for environmental remediation and product related liabilities  including provisions for testing for potential remediation of conditions at its own facilities 
while abi believes its estimate of the future amount of these liabilities is reasonable and that they will be paid for the most part over a period of one to seven years  the timing and amount of such payments may differ significantly from abi s assumptions 
although the effect of future government regulation could have a significant effect on abi s costs  abi is not aware of any pending legislation which could significantly affect the liabilities abi has established for these matters 
there can be no assurances that the costs of any future government regulations could be passed along by abi to its customers 
certain legal and administrative claims are pending or have been asserted against abi 
among these claims  abi is a named party in several actions associated with waste disposal sites and asbestos related claims 
these actions include possible obligations to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of wastes deposited at various sites  including superfund sites 
the exact amount of such future costs to abi is indeterminable due to such unknown factors as the magnitude of cleanup costs  the timing and extent of the remedial actions that may be required  the determination of abi s liability in proportion to other potentially responsible parties and the extent to which costs may be recoverable from insurance 
abi has recorded provisions in its consolidated financial statements for the estimated probable loss associated with all known environmental and asbestos related contingencies 
the contingencies also include claims for personal injury and or property damage 
see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the company has identified a number of its accounting policies that it has determined to be critical 
these critical accounting policies primarily relate to financial statement assertions that are based on the estimates and assumptions of management where the impact of changing those estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
following is a summary of our critical accounting policies 
asbestos liabilities as discussed previously  the company and its subsidiary congoleum are parties to a significant number of lawsuits stemming from their previous manufacture of asbestos containing products 
abi has recorded in its consolidated balance sheet a liability and corresponding insurance receivable based on its estimates of the future costs and related insurance recoveries to settle asbestos litigation and pay for related legal and loss handling costs 
these estimates are based on a number of subjective assumptions  including the anticipated costs to settle claims  the cost to litigate claims  the number of claims expected to be received  and the applicability and allocation of insurance coverage to these costs 
due to the numerous uncertainties related to future asbestos litigation trends and costs  the company does not believe reasonable estimates can be developed beyond a five year horizon 
accordingly  the company s estimated liability is based on claims currently filed as well as claims anticipated to be filed over the next five years 
due to the highly subjective nature of these assumptions  the company has estimated a wide range of potential future costs and insurance recoveries and  because management believes that no amount within the range is more likely than any other  has recorded a liability and insurance receivable based on the low end of the range in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  the selection of a different amount within the range could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements  as could future developments  which may differ from the assumptions used in developing the company s estimates 
the company s subsidiary congoleum is a party to a significant number of lawsuits stemming from its manufacture of asbestos containing products and has announced its intent to seek confirmation of a pre packaged plan of reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code as part of its strategy to resolve this liability 
congoleum s estimated minimum gross liability to cover judgments and or settlements of known asbestos claims is million  not including the cost to defend and litigate these cases  which is substantially in excess of both the total assets of congoleum as well as congoleum s previous estimates made in prior periods of the maximum liability for both known and unasserted claims 
while congoleum purchased insurance coverage it believes applies to these claims  some of the insurance carriers are presently insolvent and the remaining solvent insurance carriers have disputed their coverage obligations 
congoleum believes the ultimate amount of its liability  and the amount of recoverable insurance  will be determined through some combination of negotiation  litigation  and bankruptcy court order  but that these amounts can no longer be reasonably estimated given all the uncertainties that presently exist 
congoleum expects that insurance will provide the vast majority of the recovery available to claimants  due to the amount of insurance coverage it purchased and the comparatively limited resources and value of congoleum itself 
congoleum believes that it does not have the necessary financial resources to litigate and or settle asbestos claims in the ordinary course of business 
as such  congoleum believes the most meaningful measure of its probable loss due to asbestos litigation is the amount it will have to contribute to the plan trust plus the costs to effect the reorganization 
congoleum estimates the minimum costs to affect this plan to be million  which it has recorded as a current liability 
the maximum amount of asbestos losses is limited to the going concern or liquidation value of congoleum  an amount which congoleum believes is substantially less than the minimum estimated liability for the known claims against it 
congoleum will update its estimates as additional information becomes available during the reorganization process  resulting in potentially material adjustments to congoleum s earnings in future periods 
environmental contingencies as discussed previously  the company has incurred liabilities related to environmental remediation costs at both third party sites and company owned sites 
management has recorded both liabilities and insurance receivables in its consolidated financial statements for its estimate of future remediation activities 
these estimates are based on certain assumptions such as the extent of clean up activities to be performed  the methods employed in the clean up activities  the company s relative share in costs at sites where other parties are involved  and the ultimate insurance coverage available 
these projects tend to be long term in nature  and these assumptions are subject to refinement as facts change 
as such  it is possible that the company may need to revise its recorded liabilities and receivables for environmental costs in future periods resulting in potentially material adjustments to the company s earnings in future periods 
valuation of deferred tax assets the company will provide for valuation reserves against its deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of sfas in evaluating the recovery of deferred tax assets  management makes certain assumptions as to future events such as the ability to generate future taxable income 
it is possible that the facts underlying these assumptions may not materialize in future periods  which may require the company to record additional deferred tax valuation allowances  or to reduce previously recorded valuation allowances 
pension plans and postretirement benefits the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
as permitted by sfas no 
 the company uses a calculated value of plan assets which is further described below 
sfas no 
requires that the effects of the performance of the pension plans assets and changes in pension liability discount rates on the company s computation of pension income expense be amortized over future periods 
the most significant element in determining the company s pension expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets 
in  the company has assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over four years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension expense 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   the company determined this rate to be 
risk factors that may affect future results the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum have significant asbestos liability and funding exposure  and the company s and congoleum s strategies for resolving this exposure may not be successful 
as more fully set forth in notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements  which is included in this report  the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum have significant liability and funding exposure for asbestos personal injury claims 
congoleum has reached an agreement in principle with attorneys representing more than of the known present claimants with asbestos claims pending against congoleum 
when consummated  this agreement will result in a global settlement of more than of the asbestos personal injury claims pending against congoleum 
the agreement in principle also contemplates congoleum pursuing a chapter reorganization seeking confirmation of a pre packaged plan that would leave its non asbestos creditors unimpaired and would resolve all pending and future personal injury asbestos claims against congoleum and its distributors and affiliates  including the company 
confirmation of such a plan will require  among other things  the supporting votes of at least of congoleum s asbestos claimants who vote on the plan  as well as a determination by the bankruptcy court that the plan has satisfied certain criteria under the bankruptcy code 
there can be no assurance that the company or congoleum will be successful in realizing these goals in this regard or in obtaining the necessary votes  consents and approvals  or in implementing the desired plan terms 
as a result  any settlement reached by congoleum or the company with their asbestos plaintiffs or plan of reorganization pursued by the company or confirmed by a bankruptcy court could vary significantly from the description in this report including descriptions incorporated by reference in this report  including the estimated costs and contributions to effect the contemplated plan of reorganization could be significantly greater than currently estimated 
any plan of reorganization pursued by congoleum will be subject to numerous conditions  approvals and other requirements  including bankruptcy court approvals  and there can be no assurance that such conditions  approvals and other requirements will be satisfied or obtained 
some additional factors that could cause actual results to differ from congoleum s and the company s goals for resolving asbestos liability by congoleum pursuing a global settlement of its and its affiliates  including the company s  pending asbestos claims and soliciting consents for and filing a prepackaged plan of reorganization bankruptcy filing include i the future cost and timing of estimated asbestos liabilities and payments and availability of insurance coverage and reimbursement from insurance companies  which underwrote the applicable insurance policies for congoleum and the company  for asbestos related claims and other costs relating to the execution and implementation of any plan of reorganization pursued by congoleum  ii timely negotiating and entering into settlement agreements on satisfactory terms with a sufficient majority of asbestos claimants  iii timely reaching agreement with other creditors  or classes of creditors  that exist or may emerge  iv the company s and congoleum s satisfaction of the conditions and obligations under their respective outstanding debt instruments  and amendment of those outstanding debt instruments  as necessary  to permit the contemplated note contribution s in connection with congoleum s plan of reorganization and to make certain financial covenants in those debt instruments less restrictive  v the response from time to time of the company s and congoleum s lenders  customers  suppliers and other constituencies to the ongoing process arising from the strategy to settle asbestos liability  vi timely obtaining sufficient creditor and court approval of any reorganization plan and vii compliance with the united states bankruptcy code  including section g 
as a result of congoleum s significant liability and funding exposure for asbestos claims  there can be no assurance that if congoleum were to incur any unforecasted or unexpected liability or disruption to its business or operations it would be able to withstand that liability or disruption and continue as an operating company 
if the company is not able to have all of its pending and future asbestos claims resolved pursuant to congoleum s anticipated plan of reorganization  the company asbestos liability and funding exposure would likely increase significantly  which increase would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operations and financial condition and possibly its ability to continue as a going concern 
for further information regarding the company s and congoleum s asbestos liability  insurance coverage and strategies to resolve that asbestos liability  please see notes  and of notes to the consolidated financial statements  which are included in this report 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum may incur substantial liability for environmental claims and compliance matters 
due to the nature of the company s and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum s businesses and certain of the substances which are or have been used  produced or discharged by them  the company s and congoleum s operations and facilities are subject to a broad range of federal  state  local and foreign legal and regulatory provisions relating to the environment  including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances at company and congoleum facilities and off site disposal locations 
the company and congoleum have historically expended substantial amounts for compliance with existing environmental laws or regulations  including environmental remediation costs at both third party sites and company and congoleum owned sites 
the company and congoleum will continue to be required to expend amounts in the future because of the nature of their prior activities at their facilities  to comply with existing environmental laws  and those amounts may be substantial 
although the company and congoleum believe that those amounts should not have a material adverse effect on their respective financial position  there is no certainty that these amounts will not have a material adverse effect on their respective financial positions because  as a result of environmental requirements becoming increasingly strict  neither the company nor congoleum is able to determine the ultimate cost of compliance with environmental laws and enforcement policies 
moreover  in addition to potentially having to pay substantial amounts for compliance  future environmental laws or regulations may require or cause the company or congoleum to modify or curtail their operations  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum  may incur substantial liability for other product and general liability claims 
in the ordinary course of their businesses  the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum become involved in lawsuits  administrative proceedings  product liability claims and other matters 
in some of these proceedings  plaintiffs may seek to recover large and sometimes unspecified amounts and the matters may remain unresolved for several years 
these matters could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition if the company or congoleum  as applicable  is unable to successfully defend against or settle these matters and its insurance coverage is insufficient to satisfy any judgments against it or settlements relating to these matters or the company or congoleum  as applicable  is unable to collect insurance proceeds relating to these matters 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum are dependent upon a continuous supply of raw materials from third party suppliers and would be harmed if there were a significant  prolonged disruption in supply or increase in its raw material costs 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum generally design and engineer their own products 
most of the raw materials required by the company for its manufacturing operations are available from multiple sources  however  the company does purchase some of its raw materials from a single source or supplier 
any significant delay in or disruption of the supply of raw materials could substantially increase the company s cost of materials  require product reformulation or require qualification of new suppliers  any one or more of which could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company s majority owned subsidiary congoleum  does not have readily available alternative sources of supply for specific designs of transfer print paper  which are produced utilizing print cylinders engraved to congoleum s specifications 
although congoleum does not anticipate any loss of this source of supply  replacement could take a considerable period of time and interrupt production of certain products  which could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum operate in highly competitive markets and some of their competitors have greater resources  and in order to be successful  the company and congoleum must keep pace with and anticipate changing customer preferences 
the market for the company s and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum s products and services is highly competitive 
some of their respective competitors have greater financial and other resources and access to capital 
furthermore  to the extent any of the company s or congoleum s competitors make a filing under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code and emerge from bankruptcy as a continuing operating company that has shed much of their pre filing liabilities  those competitors could have a cost competitive advantage over congoleum 
in addition  in order to maintain their competitive positions  the company and congoleum may need to make substantial investments in their businesses  including  as applicable  product development  manufacturing facilities  distribution network and sales and marketing activities 
competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for their products and in the loss of market share for their products 
moreover  due to the competitive nature of their industries  they may be commercially restricted from raising or even maintaining the sales prices of their products  which could result in the incurrence of significant operating losses if their expenses were to increase or otherwise represent an increased percentage of sales 
the markets in which the company and congoleum compete are characterized by frequent new product introductions and changing customer preferences 
there can be no assurance that the company s and congoleum s existing products and services will be properly positioned in the market or that the company and congoleum will be able to introduce new or enhanced products or services into their respective markets on a timely basis  or at all  or that those new or enhanced products or services will receive customer acceptance 
the company s and congoleum s failure to introduce new or enhanced products or services on a timely basis  keep pace with industry or market changes or effectively manage the transitions to new products  technologies or services could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum are subject to general economic conditions and conditions specific to their respective industries 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum are subject to the effects of general economic conditions 
a sustained general economic slowdown could have serious negative consequences for the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  their businesses are affected by the economic factors that affect their respective industries 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum could realize shipment delays  depletion of inventory and increased production costs resulting from unexpected disruptions of operations at any of the company s or congoleum s facilities 
the company s and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum s businesses depend upon their ability to timely manufacture and deliver products that meet the needs of their customers and the end users of their products 
if the company or congoleum were to realize an unexpected  significant and prolonged disruption of its operations at any of its facilities  including disruptions in its manufacturing operations  it could result in shipment delays of its products  depletion of its inventory as a result of reduced production and increased production costs as a result of taking actions in an attempt to cure the disruption or carry on its business while the disruption remains 
any resulting delay  depletion or increased production cost could result in increased costs  lower revenues and damaged customer and product end user relations  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum offer limited warranties on their products which could result in the company or congoleum incurring significant costs as a result of warranty claims 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum offer a limited warranty on many of their products against manufacturing defects 
in addition  as a part of its efforts to differentiate mid and high end products through color  design and other attributes  congoleum offers enhanced warranties with respect to wear  moisture discoloration and other performance characteristics which generally increase with the price of such products 
if the company or congoleum were to incur a significant number of warranty claims  the resulting warranty costs could be substantial 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum rely on a small number of customers and distributors for a significant portion of their sales or to sell their products 
the company s tape and flooring divisions principally sell their products through distributors 
sales to five unaffiliated customers accounted for approximately of the company s tape division s net sales for the year ended december  and of its net sales for the year ended december  the loss of two or more of those customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s majority owned subsidiary congoleum principally sells its products through distributors 
while most of congoleum s distributors have marketed congoleum s products for many years  replacements are necessary periodically to maintain the strength of congoleum s distribution network 
although congoleum has more than one distributor in some of its distribution territories and actively manages its credit exposure to its distributors  the loss of a major distributor could have a materially adverse impact on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
congoleum derives a significant percentage of its sales from two of its distributors 
these two distributors accounted for approximately of congoleum s net sales for the year ended december  and of congoleum s net sales for the year ended december the company s subsidiary k m associates lp sells its products through its own direct sales force and  indirectly  through a wholly owned subsidiary and through third party sales representatives 
three of k m associates lp s customers accounted for approximately of its net sales for the year ended december  and of its net sales for the year ended december  the loss of k m associates lp s largest customer would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum depend on key executives to run their businesses  and the loss of any of these executives would likely harm the company s business 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum depend on key executives to run their businesses 
in particular  the same persons that serve as key executives at the company also serve as key executives at congoleum 
the company s future success will depend largely upon the continued service of these key executives  all of whom have no employment contract with the company or congoleum  as applicable  and may terminate their employment at any time without notice 
although certain key executives of the company and congoleum are  directly or indirectly  large shareholders of the company or congoleum  and thus are less likely to terminate their employment  the loss of any key executive  or the failure by the key executive to perform in his current position  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to changes in prevailing market interest rates affecting the return on its investments but does not consider this interest rate market risk exposure to be material to its consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
the company invests primarily in highly liquid debt instruments with strong credit ratings and short term less than one year maturities 
the carrying amount of these investments approximates fair value due to the short term maturities 
substantially all of the company s outstanding long term debt as of december  consisted of indebtedness with a fixed rate of interest  which is not subject to change based upon changes in prevailing market interest rates 
the company operates internationally  principally in canada  europe and the far east  giving rise to exposure to market risks from changes in foreign exchange rates 
to a certain extent  foreign currency exchange rate movements also affect the company s competitive position  as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and or pricing strategies of non us based competitors 
for foreign currency exposures existing at december   a unfavorable movement in currency exchange rates in the near term would not materially affect abi s consolidated operating results  financial position or cash flows 
under its current policies  the company does not use derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices or equity prices and does not hold any instruments for trading purposes
