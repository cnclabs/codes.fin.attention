see quarterly financial information unaudited and the preceding discussion on results of operations apparel business 
critical accounting policies the financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
this requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience  analysis of current trends  and various other factors that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
periodically  the company s accounting policies  assumptions  and estimates are reevaluated and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances warrant 
historically  actual results have not differed materially from those determined using required estimates 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes accompanying the financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
however  the company considers the following accounting policies to be more dependent on the use of estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition revenue from merchandise sales is net of returns and allowances and excludes sales tax 
the provisions of the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  have been applied  and as a result  a reserve is provided for estimated future sales returns that is based on an analysis of actual returns received following the end of each fiscal period 
the company also defers the recognition of layaway sales to the date of delivery 
a change in the actual rate of sales returns and layaway sales experience would affect the amount of revenue recognized 
inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined by the retail inventory method first in  first out method  which is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry 
under the retail inventory method rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are adjusted based on the effect of markdowns and shrinkage relating to the company s retail inventories 
the use of the rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
the rim calculation involves certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  initial merchandise pricing  markup  markdowns  and shrinkage  all of which affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as resulting gross margins 
events such as store closings  liquidations  and the general economic environment for retail apparel sales could result in an increase in the level of markdowns  which under the rim would result in lower inventory values and an increase to cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales in future periods 
in addition  failure to estimate markdowns currently would result in an overstatement of inventory cost under the lower of cost or market principle 
income taxes as part of the periodic financial statement closing process  the company estimates its income tax liability and assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
income taxes payable are estimated based on enacted tax rates applied to the income expected to be taxed currently 
the realizability of deferred tax assets is assessed based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and the projection of future taxable income 
the company cannot guarantee that it will be profitable in future years 
historically there have not been significant differences between the estimated tax accrual versus actual amounts
