item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition as of december  should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we derive revenues principally from the following sale of tickets to automobile races and other events held at our speedway facilities  licensing of television  cable network and radio rights to broadcast such events  sale of sponsorships  facility naming rights  promotions and hospitality to companies that desire to advertise  sell or promote their products or services surrounding such events  sale of souvenirs and commissions earned on food and beverage sales during such events  and rental of luxury suites during such events and other track facilities 
we derive additional revenue from the operations of the speedway clubs at lms and tms  racing  mbm  oil chem  racing country usa  and wmi 
see business other operating revenue and note to the consolidated financial statements for descriptions of these businesses 
we classify our revenues as admissions  event related revenue  nascar broadcasting revenue  and other operating revenue 
admissions includes ticket sales for all of our events 
event related revenue includes amounts received from sponsorship fees  naming rights fees  food and beverage commissioned sales  souvenir sales  promotional and hospitality revenues  luxury suite rentals  broadcasting rights other than nascar broadcasting revenue  track rentals  and other event and speedway related revenue 
nascar broadcasting revenue includes rights fees obtained for domestic television broadcasts of nascar sanctioned events held at our speedways 
other operating revenue 
table of contents includes speedway clubs restaurant  catering and membership income  legends car operations  and industrial park rentals  and mbm  oil chem  wmi and certain smip revenues 
our revenue items produce different operating margins 
broadcast rights  sponsorships  ticket sales  food and beverage commissioned sales  and luxury suite and track rentals produce higher margins than souvenir sales  as well as sales of legends cars  mbm  oil chem  wmi or other operating revenues 
we classify our expenses to include direct expense of events  nascar purse and sanction fees  and other direct operating expense  among other categories 
direct expense of events principally includes cost of souvenir sales and food and beverage sales prior to the levy group management contract in  non nascar race purses and sanctioning fees  property and event insurance  compensation of certain employees  advertising and outside event support services 
nascar purse and sanction fees includes payments to nascar for associated events held at our speedways 
other direct operating expense includes the cost of speedway clubs operations  legends car  industrial park rental  mbm  oil chem  and wmi revenues 
we sponsor and promote outdoor motorsports events 
weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets  concessions and souvenirs  among other things 
although we sell a substantial number of tickets well in advance of our larger events  poor weather conditions can have a negative effect on our results of operations 
significant growth in our revenues will depend on consistent investment in facilities 
we have several capital projects underway at each of our speedways 
we do not believe that our financial performance has been materially affected by inflation 
we have generally been able to mitigate the effects of inflation by increasing prices

net income for decreased by million  or  to million  from such income for this decrease was due to the factors discussed above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues for increased by million  or  to million  over such revenues for this improvement was due primarily to an increase in nascar broadcasting revenue 
admissions for decreased by million  or  from such revenue for this decrease was due primarily to lower attendance at nascar sanctioned racing events held at lms  lvms and tms  an irl racing event held at tms  and woo and udtra racing events held at bms 
the overall decrease was partially offset by increased admissions at nascar sanctioned racing events held at bms and ir 
in  admissions were negatively impacted by a convergence of factors including challenging economic conditions  public concerns over additional incidents similar to september  and air travel  and an early substantial lead in and winning of the winston cup series points race 
admissions from corporate customers were negatively impacted more than individual customers 
event related revenue for decreased by million  or  from such revenue for the decrease was due to lower corporate suite rental  hospitality and other event related revenues  and decreased concession sales associated with lower attendance in the decrease was also due to an irl racing event hosted at lvms in which was not held in in  the challenging economic conditions  public concerns over additional incidents and air travel  and an early substantial lead in and winning of the winston cup series points race  negatively impacted attendance with resulting effects on event related revenues 
similar to admission revenues  event related revenues from corporate customers were negatively impacted more than individual customers 
nascar broadcasting revenue for increased by million  or  over such revenue for this increase was due to increases in broadcast rights fees for nascar sanctioned racing events held in 
table of contents other operating revenue for decreased by million  or  from such revenue for this decrease was due primarily to decreased oil chem revenues associated with reduced advertising while ftc litigation with oil chem continued  and to decreased legends car  mbm  and certain smip outside venue revenues

other direct operating expense for decreased by million  or  from such expense for this decrease was due primarily to reduced advertising while ftc litigation with oil chem continued  and to decreased operating and advertising costs associated with reduced oil chem  legends car  mbm and certain smip outside venue revenues 
the overall decrease was partially offset by an increase in costs associated with the growth in wmi revenues 
general and administrative expense for increased by million  or  over such expense for this increase was attributable to increases in operating costs associated with the growth and expansion at our speedways and operations  and to legal costs associated with the ftc litigation with oil chem and other legal matters 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expense was in and in depreciation and amortization expense for increased by million  or  over such expense for this increase results primarily from additions to property and equipment at our speedways

see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
concession contract rights resolution of million for represents costs to reacquire the contract rights to provide event food  beverage and souvenir merchandising services at ir from a previous provider whose original contract term expired in  including legal and other transaction costs 
we anticipate the present value of estimated net future benefits under the contract rights as of the resolution date exceeded its costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
other income for increased by million  to million  over such income for this increase results primarily from gains recognized upon expiration in of buyer rights under certain tms condominium sales contracts whereby buyers could require our repurchase within three years from date of purchase 
recognition of such gains was deferred until the buyer s right expired 
the increase was also due to larger gains on tms condominium sales in the overall increase was partially offset by lower gains from sales of marketable equity securities and other investments  from loss recognition for decreased fair value of certain marketable equity securities  and from gains on repurchases of convertible debentures in income tax provision

net revenues from membership fees previously were recognized as income when billed and associated expenses were incurred 
under the new method  net membership revenues are deferred when billed and amortized into income over ten years 
net income for increased by million  or  to million  over such income for this increase was due to the factors discussed above 
seasonality and quarterly results we plan to promote major annual racing events in sanctioned by nascar  including ten winston cup and seven busch series racing events 
we will also sponsor five nascar craftsman truck series racing events  two irl racing events  four major nhra racing events  and six woo racing events 
as a result  our business has been  and is expected to remain  highly seasonal 
we sometimes produce minimal operating income or losses during our third quarter when we host only one major nascar race weekend 
concentration of racing events in any particular future quarter  and the growth in our operations with attendant increases in overhead expenses  may tend to increase operating losses or minimize operating income in respective future quarters 
racing schedules may be changed from time to time which can lessen the comparability of operating results between quarters of successive years and increase or decrease the seasonal nature of our motorsports business 
we recognize revenues and operating expenses for all events in the calendar quarter in which conducted except for major nascar and other sanctioned racing events which occur on the last full weekend of a calendar quarter 
when major racing events occur on the last full weekend of a calendar quarter  the race event revenues and operating expenses are recognized in the current or immediately succeeding calendar quarter that corresponds to the calendar quarter of the prior year in which the same major racing event was conducted 
we have adopted this accounting policy to help ensure comparability and consistency between quarterly financial statements of successive years 
a major nascar sanctioned racing event scheduled to be held at tms on the weekend of march  was held last year on the weekend of april  accordingly  the revenues and operating expenses of the race event will be recognized in the second quarter corresponding with those of the race event recognized in the second quarter also  a major nascar sanctioned racing event held at bms on the weekend of march  was held the previous year on the weekend of march  accordingly  the revenues and operating expenses of the race event were recognized in the first quarter  whereas those of the race event were recognized in the second quarter the more significant racing schedule changes that have occurred during the last three years include the following ams hosted an irl event in the second quarter which was held in the third quarter  and was not held in the third quarter irl event at ams was hosted under a restructured sanctioning agreement whereby net event results were included in event related revenue 
the second quarter irl event results are included in admissions and event related revenues and direct expense of events 
bms hosted nascar winston cup and busch series racing events in the first quarter which were held in the second quarter bms hosted woo and udtra pro dirt car series racing events in the second quarter which were not held in bms hosted a major nhra sanctioned nationals racing event in the second quarter which was held in the third quarter 
table of contents an irl racing event hosted by lvms in the second quarter  whereby net events results were included in event related revenue  was not held in tms hosted nascar craftsman truck and irl series racing events in the third quarter which were held in the fourth quarter the table below shows excerpted results from our quarterly reports on form q filed in the years ended december  and as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we adopted sfas no

near term operating factors there are many factors that affect our growth potential  future operations and financial results  including some of the following operating factors current operating trends 
the national incidents of september  have raised a combination of operating factors never before encountered  including public concerns regarding air travel  military actions  and additional national or local catastrophic incidents 
these factors  in an already challenging economy  are affecting consumer and corporate spending sentiment 
economic conditions and competitive racing can affect ticket and other sales 
we believe long term ticket demand  including corporate marketing and promotional spending  should continue to grow 
however  near term ticket sales  particularly to corporate customers  and suite rentals  hospitality and other event 
table of contents revenues have been  and may continue to be  adversely impacted by these and other factors 
we have decided not to increase many ticket and concession prices at least for to help foster fan support and mitigate any near term weakness 
nascar broadcasting rights agreement 
fiscal was our second year under the multi year consolidated domestic television broadcast rights agreement for nascar winston cup and busch series events 
the new agreement is expected to provide us with future increases in contracted broadcasting revenues 
total revenues under this domestic broadcast rights agreement is expected to approximate million in  reflecting an increase of approximately million over while this long term rights agreement will likely result in annual revenue increases over the contract period  associated annual increases in purse and sanction fees paid to nascar have increased  and may continue to increase  at a relatively higher rate 
purse and sanction fees are negotiated with nascar on an annual basis 
insurance coverage 
heightened concerns and challenges regarding property  casualty  liability  business interruption  and other insurance coverage have resulted after the national incidents on september  it has become increasingly difficult to obtain high policy limits of coverage at reasonable costs  including coverage for acts of terrorism 
we have a material investment in property and equipment at each of our six speedway facilities  generally located near highly populated cities  and which hold motorsports events typically attended by large numbers of fans 
these operational  geographical  and situational factors  among others  have resulted in significant increases in insurance premium costs in fiscal  and further increases are possible 
while we believe we have reasonable limits of property  casualty  liability  and business interruption insurance in force  including coverage for acts of terrorism  we can not guarantee that such coverage would be adequate should a catastrophic event occur 
the occurrence of such an incident at any of our speedway facilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if asset damage and or company liability were to exceed insurance coverage limits 
the occurrence of additional national incidents  and particularly incidents at sporting event  entertainment or other public venues  may significantly impair our ability to obtain such insurance coverage in the future 
litigation costs 
as discussed in legal proceedings and note to the december  consolidated financial statements  we are involved in various litigation for which significant legal costs were incurred in fiscal  particularly associated with the ftc litigation with oil chem 
we intend to defend vigorously against the claims raised in existing legal actions  and we will likely incur significant legal costs in fiscal we are presently unable to quantify the amount of these expected legal costs 
new or changes in pending or threatened legal action against us could result in further increases in legal costs 
significant factors in the following are significant factors that affected our financial condition and results of operations in the year ended december  general factors 
operating results for fiscal were negatively impacted by public concerns over travel  difficult economic conditions and national security incidents 
reduced consumer and corporate spending at several of our major racing events negatively impacted attendance with related effects on event related revenue 
complaint against oil chem research corp 
on january   the federal trade commission filed a complaint against smi and oil chem seeking a judgment to enjoin smi and oil chem from advertising zmax power system for use in motor vehicles and to award equitable relief to redress alleged injury to consumers 
see legal proceedings for additional information on this legal matter 
in march  this matter was settled 
while we do not believe that the outcome of this lawsuit will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations  we incurred significant legal costs in defending this action 
complaint against bristol motor speedway 
on february   robert l 
larry carrier filed a lawsuit against smi and bms in the chancery court for sullivan county  tennessee 
this suit alleged that smi and bms interfered with the use of a leasehold property rented to the plaintiff by bms 
the complaint sought compensatory and punitive damages as well as injunctive relief 
on october   the trial court entered a judgment against smi and bms for approximately million in damages plus costs 
on february   the court entered into an amended judgment awarding approximately million to the plaintiff  and awarding bms exclusive possession of the leased 
table of contents premises 
a charge to earnings of approximately million was reflected in for the litigation 
see legal proceedings for additional information on this legal matter 
the plaintiff and the company have appealed this judgment 
the company believes that the plaintiff s claim is without merit and intends to pursue its rights to appeal vigorously 
long term management contract and asset sale 
in february  certain smi subsidiaries and levy premium foodservice limited partnership and compass group usa  inc consummated a long term food and beverage management agreement and an asset purchase agreement 
the levy group has exclusive rights to provide on site food  beverage  and hospitality catering services for essentially all events and operations of our six speedways and other outside venues beginning february these services were previously provided by our smip subsidiary 
this new management agreement affects our reporting of operating profits associated with food  beverage and hospitality catering activities 
beginning in  we now report operating profits from such activities provided by the levy group as net event related revenue and other operating revenue 
for periods before  revenues and expenses associated with those services previously provided by smip are included in event related revenue  other operating revenue  direct expense of events  other direct operating expense and general and administrative expense 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the transaction 
discontinued operations and disposal of business 
in march  the company committed to a formal plan to discontinue and dispose of the operations of soldusa due to continuing difficult market conditions for internet auction and e commerce companies 
the disposal occurred in the second quarter see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the disposal of soldusa 
early redemption of convertible subordinated debentures 
on april   we redeemed all outstanding convertible subordinated debentures aggregating million at of par value 
at march    shares of common stock would have been issuable upon conversion 
management  including the board of directors  believes redemption was in our long term interest and an appropriate use of available funds 
redemption reduces future interest expense and eliminates the associated dilution effect on earnings per share  and was funded entirely from available cash and cash investments on hand 
as such  cash and cash investments and long term debt were reduced by approximately million upon redemption  excluding redemption premium  accrued interest and transaction costs 
the redemption premium  associated unamortized net deferred loan costs  and transaction costs totaling approximately  before income taxes  was reflected as a charge to earnings in no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility to fund the redemption 
declaration of initial cash dividend 
on october   our board of directors approved an initial annual cash dividend of per share of common stock  which aggregated approximately  paid on november  to shareholders of record as of october  liquidity and capital resources we have historically met our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through a combination of cash flows from operations  bank borrowings and other debt and equity offerings 
we expended significant amounts of cash in for improvements and expansion at our speedway facilities 
significant changes in our financial condition and liquidity during resulted primarily from net cash generated by operations amounting to million  capital expenditures amounting to million  proceeds from sale of property to the levy group amounting to million  redemption of convertible subordinated debentures totaling million  an increase in deferred race event revenue amounting to million  and payment of an initial annual cash dividend amounting to million 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million and had million in outstanding borrowings under the million credit facility 
the convertible subordinated debentures redemption and annual cash dividend in were paid using available cash and cash investments 
at december   net deferred tax liabilities totaled million 
while primarily representing the tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax bases of assets and liabilities  the likely future reversal of net deferred income tax liabilities could negatively impact cash flows from operations in the years in which reversal occurs 

table of contents as further discussed in notes   and to the consolidated financial statements  we had the following contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual cash obligations total current years years thereafter current liabilities  excluding current maturities of long term debt and deferred race event income long term debt  including current maturities payable to affiliate other liabilities operating leases total contractual cash obligations commitment expiration by period other commercial commitments total current years years thereafter standby letters of credit  total other commercial commitments we presently do not have any significant off balance sheet obligations  guarantees  commitments or other contractual cash obligations or other commercial commitments 
we anticipate that cash from operations  and funds available through the credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our operating needs through  including planned capital expenditures at our speedway facilities or any dividends that might be declared 
based upon anticipated future growth and financing requirements  we expect that we will  from time to time  engage in additional financing of a character and in amounts to be determined 
we may  from time to time  redeem or retire our debt securities  and purchase our debt and equity securities  depending on liquidity  prevailing market conditions  as well as such factors as permissibility under the credit facility  and the senior subordinated notes  and as our board of directors  in its sole discretion  may consider relevant 
while we expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from our existing speedway operations  and have generally experienced improvement in our financial condition  liquidity and credit availability  such resources  as well as possibly others  could be needed to fund our continued growth  including the continued expansion and improvement of our speedway facilities 
capital expenditures significant growth in our revenues depends  in large part  on consistent investment in facilities 
we expect to continue to make substantial capital improvements in our facilities to meet increasing demand and to increase revenue 
currently  a number of significant capital projects are underway 
projects 
in  we substantially completed our multi year major renovation of ir  including reconfiguration and modernization into a stadium style road racing course  adding approximately  new permanent seats and new luxury suites 
ir s new raceway facilities feature underground pedestrian tunnels  hillside terrace seats  an enlarged pit road  a world class turn  three quarter mile karting center and an expanded motorsports industrial park 
we also widened certain front stretch concourses at lms to improve spectator convenience and accessibility 
in  we continued to improve and expand on site roads and available parking  and reconfigure traffic patterns and entrances to ease congestion and improve traffic flow  as well as further expand concessions  restroom and other fan amenities for the convenience  comfort and enjoyment of fans at each of our speedways 
projects 
at december   we had various construction projects underway to increase and improve facilities for fan amenities and other site improvements at our speedways 
our multi year reconfiguration and modernization of ir was substantially finished in  with completion presently scheduled for in  we began construction at bms of approximately  new permanent grandstand seats for a net increase of approximately  including new luxury suites  featuring new stadium style seating  outstanding views  convenient elevator access and popular food courts 
completion of bms s expansion is presently scheduled for march in  we plan to begin construction at lvms of approximately  new permanent seats  completion of which is presently scheduled for similar to prior years  we plan to continue expanding concessions  restrooms and other fan amenities for the convenience  comfort and enjoyment of fans at several of our speedways 
we also plan 
table of contents to continue improving and expanding on site roads and available parking  reconfiguring traffic patterns and entrances to ease congestion and improve traffic flow particularly at ir  and at other company speedways 
the estimated aggregate cost of capital expenditures in will approximate million 
numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control  may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements at our facilities  including undetected soil or land conditions  additional land acquisition costs  increases in the cost of construction materials and labor  unforeseen changes in design  litigation  accidents or natural disasters affecting the construction site  and national or regional economic changes 
in addition  the actual cost could vary materially from our estimates if our assumptions about the quality of materials or workmanship required or the cost of financing such construction were to change 
construction is also subject to state and local permitting processes  which if changed  could materially affect the ultimate cost 
we also continually evaluate new opportunities that will add value for our stockholders  including the acquisition and construction of new speedway facilities  the expansion and development of our existing legends cars and oil chem products and markets and the expansion into complementary businesses 
dividends any decision concerning the payment of common stock dividends depends upon our results of operations  financial condition and capital expenditure plans  as well as such factors as permitted under the credit facility and the senior subordinated notes and as the company s board of directors  in its sole discretion  may consider relevant 
the credit facility was recently amended to allow payment of dividends and repurchase of smi securities up to million annually 
on october   the company s board of directors approved an initial annual cash dividend of per share of common stock payable on november  to shareholders of record as of october  critical accounting policies and accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement date  and reported amounts of revenues and expenses  including amounts that are susceptible to change 
our critical accounting policies include accounting methods and estimates underlying such financial statement preparation  as well as judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies 
in applying critical accounting policies and making estimates  materially different amounts or results could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and the consolidated financial statements  including the associated notes  appearing elsewhere in this report 
while we believe the accounting estimates discussed below are significant to our financial statements and disclosures  none are considered critical 
we believe our critical accounting policies  including amounts involving significant estimates  uncertainties and susceptibility to change include the following recoverability of property and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets 
we have net property and equipment of million  and net goodwill and other intangible assets of million  as of december  as discussed in recently issued accounting standards below and note to the consolidated financial statements  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets under which we assessed initial impairment under transitional rules as of january  the cumulative effect of the accounting change for goodwill impairment associated with certain non motorsports related reporting units reduced fiscal year net income approximately million  net of income taxes of  we periodically evaluate long lived assets for possible impairment based on expected future undiscounted operating cash flows and profitability attributable to such assets or when indications of possible impairment occur 
the evaluation is subjective and based on conditions  trends and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation 
while we believe no impairment exists at december  under accounting standards applicable at that date  different conditions or assumptions  or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of our impairment evaluation and our financial condition or future results of operations 

table of contents depreciable lives for property and equipment 
depreciation is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
we have net property and equipment of million as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our property and equipment and estimated useful lives 
we believe the estimated useful lives we use to record depreciation expense are appropriate and no changes are expected at this time 
however  because we have a material investment in depreciable property and equipment  changes in depreciable lives  should they occur  could have a significant impact on our financial condition or future results of operations 
property held for sale 
our property held for sale at december  includes land for development with a carrying value of million and speedway condominiums held for sale with a carrying value of million 
the carrying value of land for development is supported by independent appraisal and market prices of comparable properties 
the carrying value of the speedway condominiums held for sale is supported by market prices of recent condominium sales 
while we believe the carrying value of such property is fully recoverable  changes in local and regional real estate markets  including zoning and other land use laws  and motorsports industry interest  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the property s market value and our financial condition or future results of operations 
revenue recognition for our racing events 
we recognize admissions  nascar broadcasting and other event related revenues when an event is held 
advance revenues and certain related direct expenses pertaining to specific events are deferred until the event is held 
deferred expenses primarily include race purses and sanctioning fees remitted to nascar or other sanctioning bodies prior to events being held 
deferred race event income relates to upcoming scheduled events 
if circumstances prevent a race from being held during the racing season  advance revenue generally is refundable and all deferred direct event expenses would be immediately recognizable except for race purses and sanctioning fees which would be refundable from nascar or other sanctioning bodies 
we believe this accounting policy results in appropriate recognition and matching of revenues and expenses associated with our racing events and helps ensure comparability and consistency between our financial statements 
we believe that our revenue recognition polices follow the guidance issued in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
we also recognize revenues and operating expenses for all events in the calendar quarter in which conducted except for major nascar and other sanctioned racing events which occur on the last full weekend of a calendar quarter 
when major racing events occur on the last full weekend of a calendar quarter  the race event revenues and operating expenses are recognized in the current or immediately succeeding calendar quarter that corresponds to the calendar quarter of the prior year in which the same major racing event was conducted 
we believe this accounting policy helps ensure comparability and consistency between our quarterly financial statements of successive years 
realization of receivables and inventories 
we assess realization of accounts and notes receivable and inventories  including any need for allowances for doubtful accounts or inventories  using  among other things  customer creditworthiness  historical collection and sales experience  and current and future market trends and conditions 
the assessment is subjective and based on conditions  trends and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation  which are subject to changes in market and economic conditions and other factors that might adversely impact realization 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future income tax effect of temporary differences between financial and income tax bases of assets and liabilities assuming they will be realized and settled at amounts reported in the financial statements 
our accounting for income taxes reflects our assessment of future tax liabilities based on assumptions and estimates for timing  likelihood of realization  and tax laws existing at the time of evaluation 
at december   net deferred tax liabilities totaled million  including net deferred tax assets of million 
a valuation allowance of  was provided against deferred tax assets as of december  these net deferred tax liabilities will likely reverse in future years and could negatively impact cash flows from operations in the years in which reversal occurs 
we believe realization of the net deferred tax assets is more likely than not and a valuation allowance on those amounts has not been recorded 
however  changes in tax laws  assumptions or estimates used in the accounting for income taxes  or changes or adjustments resulting from review by taxing authorities  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on amounts or timing of realization or settlement 
such effects could result in a material acceleration of income taxes currently payable or valuation charges for realization uncertainties  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or future results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes 

table of contents legal proceedings and contingencies 
as discussed above in legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements  we are involved in various legal matters and we intend to continue to defend ourselves in existing legal actions in fiscal we use a combination of insurance and self insurance to manage various risks associated with our speedway and other properties and motorsports events  as discussed above in near term operating factors insurance coverage  and other business risks 
we accrue a liability for contingencies if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable 
in  we recorded a charge to earnings of approximately million for litigation associated with bms 
the likelihood of an adverse outcome and estimation of amounts are assessed using legal counsel on matters related to litigation  outside consultants  historical trends  and assumptions and other information available at the time of assessment 
we believe amounts requiring accrual are properly reflected in the accompanying financial statements 
we do not believe the outcome of the lawsuits  incidents or other legal or business risk matters  will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations 
however  new or changes in pending or threatened legal action or claims against us  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of these matters and our financial condition or future results of operations 
accounting for stock based compensation 
as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  we continue to account for stock based employee compensation using accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees which recognizes compensation cost based on the intrinsic value of equity instruments awarded as permitted under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
as all stock options granted under the company s stock option plans have exercise prices equal to market value of the underlying common stock at grant date  no compensation cost has been reflected in net income for these plans 
as discussed below in recently issued accounting standards  the company has applied the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb no 
in the consolidated financial statements 
the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share had compensation cost for stock options been determined using the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
is illustrated in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the financial accounting standards board fasb and the sec continue to evaluate the appropriate treatment of employee stock options  including efforts to reach a consensus on proper methodology for expensing and valuing options 
in the future  the fasb and sec may require that net income and earnings per share reflect compensation cost for stock options determined using fair value recognition provisions similar to  or the same as  sfas no 
such future changes in accounting standards  depending on numerous factors including  among others  market conditions and prices for our common stock  the number of options granted  exercised or cancelled  or the sensitivity and fluctuation in assumptions used in valuation methods  could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets as of january  sfas no 
specifies  among other things  that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized  but instead evaluated for possible impairment at least annually

such assessment is performed annually as of april or when events or circumstances indicate possible impairment may have occurred

as such  gains and losses 
table of contents from debt extinguishments should be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet certain criteria in apb opinion no 
such criteria distinguishes transactions that are part of an entity s recurring operations from those that are unusual or infrequent or that meet the criteria of apb opinion no 
for classification as an extraordinary item

the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  we applied the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes

disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information on our financial statement disclosures 
our motorsports related operations comprise one operating segment  and encompass all admissions  event related  nascar broadcasting  and certain other operating revenues and associated expenses 
our other operations comprising non motorsports related activities presently are not significant relative to those of motorsports related operations 
as such  at this time  sfas no

environmental matters lms s property includes areas that were used as solid waste landfills for many years 
landfilling of general categories of municipal solid waste on the lms property ceased in there is one lcid landfill currently being permitted at lms  however  to receive inert debris and waste from land clearing activities  and one lcid landfill that was closed in two other lcid landfills on the lms property were closed in lms intends to allow similar lcid landfills to be operated on the lms property in the future 
prior to  lms leased certain property to allied for use as c d landfill  which received solid waste resulting solely from construction  remodeling  repair or demolition operations on pavement  buildings or other structures  but could not receive inert debris  land clearing debris or yard debris 
the lms c d landfill is now closed 
in addition  allied owns and operates an active solid waste landfill 
table of contents adjacent to lms 
we believe that the active solid waste landfill was constructed in such a manner as to minimize the risk of contamination to surrounding property 
we also believe that our operations  including the landfills and facilities on our property  are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
we are not aware of any situations related to landfill operations which we expect would materially adversely affect our financial position or future results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk
