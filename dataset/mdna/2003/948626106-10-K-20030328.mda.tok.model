we conduct our business through a combination of company owned and franchise operations  with company owned operations accounting for of total worldwide attendance for the fiscal year ended december  of which of our revenues were derived from our us operations  and the remaining of our revenues result from our international operations 
we derive our revenues principally from meeting fees 
our members pay us a weekly fee to attend our classes

we sell proprietary products that complement our program  such as snack bars  books  cd roms and points calculators  to our members and franchisees 
franchise royalties 
our franchisees typically pay us a royalty fee of of their meeting fee revenues

revenue sources in millions fiscal years ended eight months ended fiscal years ended december  december  december  april  april  april  april  naco meetings fees international company owned meeting fees product sales franchise royalties other pre packaged meals discontinued total in fiscal  we made the strategic decision to discontinue the sale of pre packaged frozen meals in our naco classroom meetings which were added in by our former owner  heinz and to introduce to our naco operations some of the best practices developed by our european managers 
after our acquisition by artal luxembourg in  we reorganized our management and strengthened our strategic focus 
since  our revenues have increased as shown in the chart above 
our operating income margin has grown from before a restructuring charge in fiscal to in fiscal the increases are principally a result of increased naco classroom attendance 
as a result of our decision to re focus our meetings exclusively on our group education approach and the introduction of our points based program developed in the united kingdom and our liberty loyalty meeting fee pricing strategy developed in france  our naco classroom attendance  excluding the impact of our acquisitions  grew between fiscal and fiscal at a compound annual rate of 
including the acquisition of weighco and our franchises in north jersey  san diego and eastern north carolina  our attendance over this period grew from million to million 
our return to a variable cost structure in our naco operations 
the introduction of pre packaged frozen meals required us to invest in a fixed cost infrastructure 
by abandoning pre packaged frozen meals  we returned our naco operations to their historical variable cost structure 
as a result  operating income margin in our naco operations improved significantly since fiscal accelerated growth in continental europe 
in continental europe  we have accelerated growth by adapting our business model to local conditions  implementing more aggressive marketing programs tailored to the local markets and increasing the number of meetings ahead of anticipated demand 
between fiscal and fiscal  attendance in our continental european operations grew at a compound annual rate of 
increased product sales 
we have increased our product sales by from fiscal to fiscal as a result of our growing attendance  introducing new products and optimizing our product mix 
in our meetings  we have increased average product sales per attendance from to over the same period 
our worldwide attendance in our company owned operations has grown by  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as shown in the chart below 
attendance in company owned operations in millions fiscal years ended twelve months ended eight months ended fiscal years ended december  december  december  december  april  april  april  april  weeks weeks weeks weeks weeks weeks weeks weeks north america united kingdom continental europe other international total during the fiscal years ended december  and december   we acquired the franchised territories and certain business assets of five franchisees as outlined below acquisitions in millions attendance fiscal years ended purchase price closing date december  december  weighco january  oregon september  north jersey january  san diego july  eastern north carolina september  from date of acquisition to the end of the fiscal year 
these acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  their results of operations have been included in our consolidated operating results since the dates of the completion of their respective acquisitions 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to customer programs and incentives  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  restructuring costs  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the bases for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most significant judgments 
revenue recognition we earn revenue by conducting meetings  selling products and aids in our meetings and to our franchisees  collecting commissions from franchisees operating under the weight watchers name and collecting royalties related to licensing agreements 
revenue is recognized when registration fees are paid  services are rendered  products are shipped to customers and title and risk of loss pass to the customer  and commissions and royalties are earned 
deferred revenue  consisting of prepaid lecture income  is amortized into income over the period earned 
from time to time  we provide various discounts to customers  including free registration offers  which are deducted from gross revenue 
goodwill and intangibles intangibles are being amortized using the straight line method over to years 
effective december   we adopted sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result  we no longer amortize goodwill  but are required to review goodwill for impairment 
we determined that the carrying amounts of all our goodwill and other intangible assets did not exceed their respective fair values 
accordingly  the initial implementation of this standard did not impact earnings during we are required to perform this comparison at least annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment 
when determining fair value  we utilize various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the carrying amounts 
in such event  we would then be required to record a corresponding charge  which would impact earnings 
we continue to evaluate these estimates and assumptions and believe that these assumptions  which included an estimate of future cash flows based upon the anticipated performance of the underlying business units  were appropriate 
hedging instruments we enter into forward and swap contracts to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies to reduce currency risk associated with fluctuating exchange rates 
these contracts are used primarily to hedge payments arising from some of our foreign currency denominated obligations 
in addition  we enter into interest rate swaps to hedge a substantial portion of our variable rate debt 
we account for our hedging instruments under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires that all derivative financial instruments be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value as either assets or liabilities 
fair value adjustments for qualifying derivative instruments are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and will be included in earnings in the periods in which earnings are affected by the hedged item 
fair value adjustments for non qualifying derivative instruments are recorded in our results of operations 
equity investee we own approximately of our affiliate and licensee  weightwatchers 
com  or approximately on a fully diluted basis including the exercise of all options and all the warrants we own in weightwatchers 
com

under a loan agreement between us and weightwatchers 
com  we advanced weightwatchers 
com million 
in  we wrote off our loans to the extent of our equity interest in weightwatchers 
com s losses 
in addition  in  we fully reserved for the remaining loan balance 
income taxes deferred income taxes result primarily from temporary differences between financial and tax reporting 
if it is more likely than not that some portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized  a valuation allowance is recognized 
we consider historic levels of income  estimates of future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a tax valuation allowance

prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
interpretation no 
requires the disclosure of certain guarantees existing at december  in addition  interpretation no 
requires the recognition of a liability for the fair value of the obligation of qualifying guarantee activities initiated or modified after december  accordingly  we will apply the recognition provisions of interpretation no 
prospectively to guarantee activities initiated after december  the fasb recently issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
interpretation no

 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fas  fas provides two additional alternative transition methods for recognizing an entity s voluntary decision to change its method of accounting for stock based employee compensation to the fair value method 
in addition  fas amends the disclosure requirements of fas so that entities under the intrinsic value method of apb will be required to disclose the pro forma effect of using the fair value method for any period for which an income statement is presented 
the disclosures are required to be made in annual financial statements and in quarterly information provided to shareholders without regard to whether the entity has adopted fas for recognition purposes 
fas s transition guidance and provisions for annual disclosures are effective for fiscal years ending after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations and interest rate changes 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the fair value of long term fixed rate debt and interest expense of variable rate debt 
we have historically managed interest rates through the use of  and our long term debt is currently composed of  a combination of fixed and variable rate borrowings 
generally  the fair market value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
based on the overall interest rate exposure on our fixed rate borrowings at december   a change in market interest rates would have less than a impact on the fair value of our long term debt 
based on variable rate debt levels at december   a change in market interest rates would have less than a impact on our net interest expense 
other than inter company transactions between our domestic and foreign entities and the portion of our senior subordinated notes that are denominated in euros  we generally do not have significant transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency applicable to each entity 
we enter into forward and swap contracts to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies to reduce the currency risk associated with fluctuating exchange rates 
these contracts are used primarily to hedge payments arising from some of our foreign currency denominated obligations 
realized and unrealized gains and losses from these transactions are included in net income for the period 
in addition  we enter into interest rate swaps to hedge a substantial portion of our variable rate debt 
changes in the fair value of these derivatives will be recorded each period in earnings for non qualifying derivatives or accumulated other comprehensive income loss for qualifying derivatives 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates may also impact our shareholders equity 
the assets and liabilities of our non us subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rate for the period 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
in addition  fluctuations in the value of the euro will cause the us dollar translated amounts to change in comparison to prior periods 
furthermore  we revalue our outstanding senior subordinated euro notes at the end of each period and the resulting change in value will be reflected in the income statement of the corresponding period 
each of our subsidiaries derives revenues and incurs expenses primarily within a single country and  consequently  does not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of normal business operations 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to more properly align the underlying sources of cash flow with our debt servicing requirements 
at december   we had long term foreign currency forward contract receivable with notional amount of euro million  offset by foreign currency forward contract payable with notional amount of million
