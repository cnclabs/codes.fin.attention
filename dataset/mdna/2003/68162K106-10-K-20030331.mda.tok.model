item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an ongoing basis  the company monitors and evaluates its estimates and assumptions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts receivable the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the allowance is maintained at a level considered appropriate based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues that the company has identified 
estimation of such losses requires adjusting historical loss experience for current economic conditions and judgments about the probable effects of economic conditions on certain customers 
the company can not guarantee that the rate of future credit losses will be similar to past experience 
the company considers all available information when assessing each quarter the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory valuation the company s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include the costs of the purchased steel  internal and external processing  and inbound freight 
cost is determined using the specific identification method 
the company regularly reviews its inventory on hand and records provisions for obsolete and slow moving inventory based on historical and current sales trends 
changes in product demand and the company s customer base may affect the value of inventory on hand  which may require higher provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventory 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets and the related estimated remaining lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
events or changes in circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to the expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends 
the company records an impairment or change in useful life whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed 
income taxes the company records operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and the estimated effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in its consolidated balance sheets 
the company follows detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction when reviewing tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provides for valuation allowances as required 
deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability based on historical taxable income  the expected reversals of existing temporary differences  tax planning strategies and  most importantly  on projections of future taxable income 
the projections of future taxable income require assumptions regarding volume  selling prices  gross margins  expense levels and industry cyclicality 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  the company will be required to record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
overview the company s results of operations are affected by numerous external factors  such as general business  economic and political conditions  competition  steel pricing and availability  energy prices  customer demand for steel  and layoffs or work stoppages by suppliers or customers personnel 
olympic sells a broad range of products  many of which have different gross margins 
products that have more value added processing generally have a greater gross margin 
accordingly  the company s overall gross margin is affected by product mix and the amount of processing performed  as well as volatility in selling prices and material purchase costs 
the company performs toll processing of customer owned steel  the majority of which is performed by its detroit and georgia operations

all international sales and payments are made in united states dollars
