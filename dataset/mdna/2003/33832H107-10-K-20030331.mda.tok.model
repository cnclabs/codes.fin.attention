flag manages net interest income in a manner that realizes the largest spread while accepting certain levels of credit  liquidity and interest rate risks 
managing these risks requires systems and processes to identify and evaluate these risks at various levels in the organization 
net interest income was million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
flag s margin has been pressured downward over the past few years by a decreasing interest rate environment 
flag s refinancing of fhlb advances in and  coupled with aggressive repricing efforts on the deposit base  helped flag reduce interest rate expense by approximately during  and more than offset decreases in interest income

non interest income total non interest income decreased to million in from million in and million in the decrease in other income in resulted largely from the absence of a gain on the sale of branches 
flag recorded gains on the sale of branches in of million and million in service charges on deposit accounts decreased during to million from million in and million in the decrease in from is due largely to the sale of two branch offices in december with approximately million in deposits 
the increase in over levels relates in part to increased demand deposits and lower earnings credits 
mortgage banking activities includes origination fees  service release premiums and the gain on the sale of mortgage loans originated solely for the purpose of being sold 
the lower interest rate environment  coupled with more effective originators  helped flag improve the income from its mortgage banking activities in by as compared to total income from mortgage banking activities increased to million in from and levels of million and million  respectively 
effective december   flag sold selected loans  deposits and property of its branches in milan and mcrae  georgia and recognized a gain on sale of approximately million 
during  flag sold the loans  deposits and property of its bank branches in cobbtown  metter and statesboro  georgia and recognized a gain on sale of approximately million 
flag also sold the loans  deposits and property of its bank branches in blackshear  homerville and waycross  georgia and recognized a gain on sale of approximately million 
non interest expenses salary and employee benefits increased during to million from million in and million in the increase in relates largely to the management restructuring undertaken in the first quarter of  in which flag took a special charge related to buyouts of employment contracts and severance of approximately million 
the decrease in compared to relates to the lower number of staff due to the sale of branch offices during occupancy expenses continued a trend  decreasing to million in from million in and million in this positive trend for flag is the result of an effort to consolidate branch offices to improve individual branch performance as well as that of the consolidated company 
this effort has resulted in offices being closed or sold since the beginning of professional fees increased to million from million in and were flat against levels of million 
the higher amounts in relate to approximately  of professional fees related to the management restructuring and private placement effected in the first quarter  whereas the higher amounts in relate to the professional fees incurred in conjunction with branch divestiture in six markets 
other expenses increased slightly over the prior year to million from million 
other expenses were million in and relate in part to increased operating and conversion expense associated with the disposition of branches in six markets 
investment securities the composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects management s strategy of maintaining an appropriate combination of liquidity  interest rate risk and yield 
flag seeks to maintain an investment portfolio with minimal credit risk  investing mostly in obligations of the us treasury or other state and federal governmental agencies 
investment securities increased to million at december  from million at december  at december   all investment securities outstanding were classified as available for sale 
the increase in investments resulted from the investment of a portion of the proceeds received from the acquisition of branch offices from encore bank in november at december   gross unrealized gains in the total portfolio amounted to million and gross unrealized losses amounted to  table reflects the carrying amount of the investment securities portfolio for the past three years

      real estate construction      provision and allowance for loan losses table presents an analysis of activities in the allowance for loan losses for the past five years 
an allowance for possible losses is provided through charges to flag s earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was million in  million in and million in flag s increase in the provision for loan losses during was needed to replenish the allowance for loan losses due to the higher than normal amount of net charge offs experienced 
the provision for loan losses included approximately million in for certain large agricultural credits and approximately million in related to retained loans in the branch divestitures and one agricultural credit in south georgia 
management determines the level of the provision for loan losses based on outstanding loan balances  the levels of non performing assets  and reviews of assets classified as substandard  doubtful  or loss and larger credits  together with an analysis of historical loss experience and current economic conditions 
as shown in table  the year end allowance for loan losses decreased to million at december   from million at december  the decrease in the allowance during was the result of higher charge offs of problem loans during than experienced in net charge offs were million in  million in  and million in the allowance for loan losses was of gross loans at december   versus and at december  and  respectively 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is both adequate and appropriate 
however  the future level of the allowance for loan losses is highly dependent upon loan growth  loan loss experience  and other factors  which cannot be anticipated with a high degree of certainty

deposits and borrowings total deposits increased approximately million during  totaling million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in flag s deposit base in is attributable to the acquisition of the six banking offices with approximately million in deposits in north metropolitan atlanta in the fourth quarter with approximately million in deposits 
the maturities of time deposits of  or more issued by the bank at december   are summarized intable table maturities of time deposits over  dollars in thousands three months or less

 over six months through twelve months  over twelve months 









 at december   the bank was a shareholder in the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb 
through this affiliation  advances totaling million were outstanding at rates competitive with time deposits of like maturities 
management anticipates continued utilization of this short and long term source of funds to minimize interest rate risk and to fund competitive fixed rate loans to customers 
during  flag repaid million in fixed rate advances from the fhlb prior to their original maturity date  incurring a prepayment penalty totaling approximately  in  flag repaid approximately million in advances with prepayment penalties totaling approximately million 
these advances were repaid in both years due to a falling interest rate environment in which flag could obtain new borrowings at significantly lower rates 
asset liability management a primary objective of flag s asset and liability management program is to control exposure to interest rate risk the exposure to changes in net interest income due to changes in market interest rates so as to enhance its earnings and protect its net worth against potential loss resulting from interest rate fluctuations 
historically  the average term to maturity or repricing rate changes of assets primarily loans and investment securities has exceeded the average repricing period of liabilities primarily deposits and borrowings 
table provides information about the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding as of december  that are expected to mature  prepay  or reprice in each of the future time periods shown ie  the interest rate sensitivity 
as presented in this table  at december   the liabilities subject to rate changes within one year exceeded our assets subject to rate changes within one year 
this mismatched condition suggests that an increasing rate environment would be detrimental to flag s margin 
however  interest bearing liabilities are not as sensitive to changing rates as are flag s assets  so management believes a rising interest rate scenario would not result in a decrease in net interest income 
management assumptions and theories regarding the interest rate risk are the products of systems that project net interest income under various scenarios and considers the sensitivity of individual components of the balance sheet 
this approach is believed to produce more accurate results than the approach summarized in the following table 
management carefully measures and monitors interest rate sensitivity and believes that its operating strategies offer protection against interest rate risk 
as required by various regulatory authorities  flag s board of directors has established an interest rate risk policy  which sets specific limits on interest rate risk exposure 
adherence to this policy is reviewed by flag s executive committee and presented at least annually to the board of directors 
management has maintained positive ratios of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities

  liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that sufficient funding is available  at reasonable cost  to meet the ongoing operational cash needs of flag and to take advantage of income producing opportunities as they arise 
while the desired level of liquidity will vary depending upon a variety of factors  it is the primary goal of flag to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity in all expected economic environments 
liquidity is defined as the ability of a bank to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
liquidity management involves maintaining flag s ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of the bank s customers  both depositors and borrowers 
the primary objectives of asset liability management are to provide for adequate liquidity in order to meet the needs of customers and to maintain an optimal balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities  so that flag can also meet the investment requirements of its shareholders as market interest rates change 
daily monitoring of the sources and use of funds is necessary to maintain a position that meets both requirements the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan principal repayments and the maturities and sales of securities 
mortgage loans held for sale totaled million at december   and typically turn over every days as the closed loans are sold to investors in the secondary market 
real estate construction and commercial loans that mature in one year or less amounted to million  or of the total loan portfolio at december  other short term investments such as federal funds sold are additional sources of liquidity 
the liability section of the balance sheet provides liquidity through depositors interest bearing and non interest bearing deposit accounts 
federal funds purchased  fhlb advances  other borrowings and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are additional sources of liquidity and represent flag s incremental borrowing capacity 
these sources of liquidity are short term in nature and are used as necessary to fund asset growth and meet other short term liquidity needs 
as disclosed in flag s consolidated statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements  net cash used by operating activities was million during the major uses of cash by operating activities were the changes in mortgage loans held for sale and the changes in other assets and liabilities 
net cash provided by investing activities of million consisted primarily of funds acquired in the acquisition of the six north metro atlanta branch offices and proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities  offset by net changes in loans  interest bearing deposits in other banks and purchases of investment securities 
net cash used by financing activities was million  and consisted mostly of the net change in deposits and the increase in amounts due to the fhlb 
in the opinion of management  flag s liquidity position at december  is sufficient to meet its expected cash flow requirements 
reference should be made to the consolidated statements of cash flows appearing in the consolidated financial statements for the three year analysis of the changes in cash and cash equivalents resulting from operating  investing and financing activities 
capital resources and dividends stockholders equity at december  increased to million from million at december  this increase is largely due to the  share private placement approved by flag s board of directors during the first quarter of during   shares and  warrants had been sold for million to the company s management or employees 
flag continued its stock repurchase program during flag repurchased  shares of its common stock in   shares of its common stock in and  shares of its common stock in the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia requires federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action with regard to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
as a result of fdicia  the federal banking agencies introduced an additional capital measure called the tier risk based capital ratio 
the tier ratio is the ratio of core capital to risk adjusted total assets 
note to the consolidated financial statements presents a summary of fdicia s capital tiers compared to flag s and the bank s actual capital levels

also  during the amount of loss before income taxes was lower than the earnings before income taxes in prior years 
the effect of tax exempt interest income and general business credits is greater in years that income loss before taxes is lower 
the tax rates for and are lower than the statutory federal rate of primarily due to interest income on tax exempt securities and general business credits 
see flag s consolidated financial statements for an analysis of income taxes 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than does the effect of inflation 
the liquidity and maturity structures of flag s assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels 
recent accounting pronouncements accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the financial accounting standards board and other standard setting entities that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on flag s consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s net interest income and the fair value of its financial instruments interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are influenced by changes in market interest rates 
the company actively manages its exposure to interest rate fluctuations through policies established by its senior management and board of directors 
the company s senior management implements asset liability management policies  develops and implements strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and net interest income and regularly assesses the interest rate sensitivity of the bank 
the company utilizes an interest rate simulation model to monitor and evaluate the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income and the market value of its investment portfolio 
the alco policy limits the maximum percentage changes in net interest income and investment portfolio equity  assuming a simultaneous  instantaneous change in interest rate 
these percentage changes are as follows changes in percentage percent change in interest rates change in net market value of in basis points interest income portfolio equity as of december   the company was in compliance with its alco policy
