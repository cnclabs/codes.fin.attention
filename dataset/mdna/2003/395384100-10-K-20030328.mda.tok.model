rate volume analysis the following table presents the effects of changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on the company s interest income and interest expense during the years indicated

change in valuation of retained interests resulted in a charge of million in the charge resulted from a revaluation of mortgage retained interests and was primarily due to an increase in estimated future credit losses associated with previously securitized home equity lines of credit 
gain on sale of loans greenpoint sells those loans it does not place in its portfolio through either whole loan sales  which involves selling pools of loans to individual purchasers  or securitization  which involves the private placement or public offering of pass through asset backed securities 
this approach allows greenpoint to capitalize on favorable conditions in either the securitization or whole loan sale market when loan production is sold 
in addition  this dual approach allows greenpoint to diversify its exposure to the volatility of the capital markets 
most mortgage loans were sold as whole loans 
these sales are done without recourse  meaning the credit risk on the loans was transferred to the buyer 
whole loan sales may either retain  or transfer to the buyer  the right to service the loans 
the company has established a reserve to cover losses associated with repurchases of sold loans due to representation and warranty violations 
this reserve was determined using historical loss data associated with loan sales and additional reserves are set aside as the volume of sold loans increases 
the liability for representations and warranties totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase was the result of the record level of whole loan sales completed in the following table summarizes loans sold and average margins earned for the year ended december  in millions whole loan mortgage sales gain on sale average margin average margin by product type specialty products home equity seconds agency jumbo securitizations mortgage sales gain on sale average margin gain on sale from whole loan sales and securitizations of mortgage loans declined million for the year

during  agency and jumbo mortgage sales totaled of total mortgages sold compared with in  while higher spread specialty products totaled of mortgages sold in  compared with in specialty product margins declined in to from the historically high earned in going forward  the gain on mortgage sales will fluctuate with the level of market interest rates and the secondary market demand for mortgage backed investments

the strength in the agency jumbo products was attributable to the favorable interest rate environment and high level of refinance activity in  while the decline in specialty product originations reflects increased pricing and competitive pressures in this market 
the period end pipeline was billion compared to billion a year ago 
allowance for loan losses the company has set forth a policy for establishment and review of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the policy requires management to provide for future costs related to problem loans 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
however  such determination is susceptible to the effect of future unanticipated changes in general economic and market conditions that may affect the financial circumstances of borrowers and or residential real estate values within the company s lending areas 
the policy is further described in the critical accounting policies section beginning on page the following table sets forth the company s allowance for loan losses at the dates and for the periods indicated

the gva analysis stratifies greenpoint s mortgage loans held for investment portfolio into three categories first mortgages  second mortgages and home equity loans 
the first mortgage and second mortgage categories are further stratified into one to four family  multi family and commercial loan strata 
the gva analysis calculates the expected losses as a percentage of loans outstanding in each loan stratum gva percentage based upon the current delinquency status within each stratum 
due to inherent limitations in using modeling techniques and gva percentages  greenpoint also maintains an unallocated allowance 
this allowance addresses short term changes in the loan portfolio s historical real estate owned performance  delinquency trends  loan products  national real estate values and portfolio growth 
the analysis also encompasses an assessment of changes in the macro economic environment 
at the end of each quarter  management determines the adequacy of the unallocated reserve to address these risks 
the allowance for possible loan losses at december  includes a million allowance balance associated with the remaining million of loans from the discontinued operation which remain in the held for investment portfolio 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of non accruing loans and other real estate owned 
total non performing assets were million at december  compared to million at december  the increase was entirely attributable to a million increase in non accruing loans held for sale 
these primarily represent loans which have been repurchased pursuant to representation and warranty commitments 
these repurchases have increased due to the high level of loan sales in the company maintains a valuation reserve through which the value of these loans is adjusted to their estimated fair value 
greenpoint attempts to convert non performing assets to interest earning assets as quickly as possible  while minimizing potential losses on the conversion

on securitization or sale  expectations are set on the default  recovery and voluntary prepayment rates 
each pool of loans is reviewed monthly to ensure that performance is meeting those expectations 
in the event performance does not meet expectations  the assumptions are revised 
final responsibility for these judgments resides with executive management  independent of the business unit 
risk management reviews monthly the delinquency and loss trends for all of the mortgage  manufactured housing  and small business loans serviced by the company  whether or not it retains credit exposure 
these reviews are intended to identify significant changes in credit quality which may indicate changes to the company s exposures or to the efficacy of its underwriting of loans sold to other investors

collection activities for greenpoint mortgage are centralized in a servicing unit in columbus  georgia 
greenpoint credit s collection activities were centralized during in a servicing center in atlanta  georgia in order to target delinquent accounts more effectively utilizing more advanced technology 
remarketing activities for greenpoint credit remain decentralized among several regional offices in order to repossess and liquidate collateral more effectively  thereby minimizing the loss severity 
collection efforts for greenpoint bank s business banking loans are handled in a collaborative manner by the credit analysts in new york and the servicing center in columbus  georgia 
the company has set forth a policy for establishment and review of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses in order to provide for estimated costs related to the problem loans 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
however  such determination is susceptible to the effect of future unanticipated changes in general economic and market conditions that may affect the financial circumstances of borrowers and or residential real estate values within the company s lending areas 
the company has also established a reserve to cover losses associated with repurchases of sold loans due to representation and warranty violations 
this reserve was sized using historical loss data associated with loan sales and additional reserves are set aside as the volume of sold loans increases 
off balance sheet arrangements and other contractual obligations prior to exiting the manufactured housing finance lending business  greenpoint securitized or sold with recourse most of its manufactured housing loans 
at december   total loans outstanding under these arrangements were billion 
greenpoint retains most of the credit risk inherent in these loans 
greenpoint also securitizes or sells certain mortgage loans with recourse 
at december   total loans outstanding under these arrangements were billion 
expected losses were deducted when estimating the gain on sale and the initial value of retained interests 
refer to note l on page of the company s consolidated financial statements  for additional information on accounting for loan sales 
the value of retained interests in the securitizations is reviewed each quarter as are the liabilities associated with letters of credit issued in the securitizations 
based on recent loss trends  the values are updated 
refer to note beginning on page for further quantitative information about recourse arrangements and retained interests 
in connection with its sale of mortgage loans  the company provides certain representations and warranties which provide the purchaser the option of returning the purchased loans to the company under certain conditions 
the company may recognize losses as the result of the repurchases of loans under the arrangements 
losses are estimated based on historical experience and are recorded as a reduction to the gain on sale of loans at the time of the original sale 
refer to note beginning on page for further quantitative information about the liability for representations and warranties 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in conjunction with the sec s rules covering disclosure about the application of critical accounting policies  greenpoint has identified five accounting polices that are critical to the presentation of greenpoint s financial statements and that require critical accounting estimates on the part of management 
following is a description of those accounting policies and where applicable a fuller explanation of the methods and assumptions underlying their application 
accounting for derivatives the accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments are established in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative and hedging activities sfas  as amended 
sfas requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial condition and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for changes in fair value of the derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
an entity that elects to apply hedge accounting is required to establish at the inception of the hedge the method it will use in assessing the effectiveness of the hedging derivative and the measurement approach for determining the ineffectiveness of the hedge 
these methods must be consistent with the entity s approach to managing risk 
greenpoint s management has made judgments in their application of sfas these judgments include the identification of hedging instruments  hedged items  nature of the risk being hedged  the market value of loan commitments and how the hedging instrument s effectiveness will be assessed 
greenpoint has designated interest rate swaps  futures contracts and forward delivery commitments as hedging instruments in fair value hedges 
certain fixed mortgage loan products held for sale are designated as hedged items in fair value hedges 
greenpoint has identified the risk of changes in fair value attributable to changes in market interest rates as the designated hedge risk 
the results of previous retrospective assessments of hedge effectiveness have established an expectation that the results of the derivative hedging instruments will substantially offset the effects of changes in the fair value of the hedged item on a prospective basis 
if the retrospective assessment determines that the hedge was not highly effective  greenpoint will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively 
if the sfas effectiveness assessment indicates that the hedge is not highly effective  greenpoint will not recognize the adjustment to the carrying amount of the loans held for sale after the last date on which compliance with the effectiveness criterion was established 
therefore  the potential loss of hedge accounting adjustments to loans held for sale may cause greenpoint to report materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk during the accumulation of interest rate lock commitments with borrowers 
if market interest rates required by investors are higher than management s assumptions  the prices paid by investors and resultant gain on sale of loans will be lower than previously estimated 
in order to mitigate this interest rate risk  greenpoint enters into derivative instruments at the time it extends the interest rate lock commitment to the borrower 
the amount and duration of the derivative instruments entered into are selected in order to have the changes in fair value correlate closely with the changes in fair value of greenpoint s interest rate lock commitments and loans held for sale 
greenpoint s interest rate lock commitments are accounted for as derivative financial instruments and recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value 
accounting for possible loan losses greenpoint calculates its allowance for loan losses in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas 
this accounting standard is used to determine the allowance associated with large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment 
greenpoint considers all of its loans held for investment to be smaller balance homogeneous loans 
sfas requires the accrual of a loss when it is probable that an asset has been impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable but unconfirmed asset impairment in the loans held for investment portfolio as of the date of the financial statements 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses for greenpoint s mortgage loans held for investment  management completes a general valuation allowance gva analysis prior to the end of each quarterly reporting period 
the gva analysis stratifies greenpoint s mortgage loans held for investment into three categories first mortgages  second mortgages and home equity loans 
the first mortgage and second mortgage categories are further stratified into one to four family  multi family and commercial loan strata 
the gva analysis calculates the expected losses as a percentage of loans outstanding in each loan stratum the gva percentage based upon the historical loss percentages experienced in that stratum 
the gva percentage is then applied to the projected balance of loans estimated to ultimately default 
the future defaults are estimated by applying historical default trends to current loan balances based on their delinquency status 
the applicable required reserve within each loan strata is calculated by applying the gva percentage to the expected defaults 
this methodology encompasses an assumption that expected defaults and expected future losses on loan defaults will follow the historical experience over the prior six quarters 
as actual experience changes  the revised average expected loss experience is included in the updated gva analysis 
due to inherent limitations in using modeling techniques and gva percentages  greenpoint maintains an unallocated reserve 
this reserve addresses short term changes in the loan portfolio s historical real estate owned performance  delinquency trends  loan products  national real estate values and portfolio growth 
the analysis also encompasses assessment of changes in the macro economic environment 
at the end of each quarter  management determines the adequacy of the unallocated reserve to address these risks 
accounting for servicing assets in applying sfas to its sales and securitizations  greenpoint s management is required to make judgments when establishing the significant assumptions used in determining fair values of servicing assets 
the fair value of servicing assets is determined by calculating the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows  using assumptions of prepayments  defaults  servicing costs and discount rates that the company believes market participants would use for similar assets 
these assumptions are reviewed on a quarterly basis and changed based on actual and expected pool performance 
in accordance with gaap disclosure requirements  note identifies the key economic assumptions underlying the valuation of servicing assets 
greenpoint stratifies its servicing assets based on the risk characteristics of the underlying pools and the assets are evaluated for impairment based on the risk characteristics 
servicing asset impairment may result in the risk strata under different conditions or using different assumptions 
as interest rates associated with the underlying loans decline  loan prepayments tend to increase  thereby reducing the fair value of the servicing asset 
in addition  a decline in the value of the servicing asset is likely to occur if either default rates or servicing costs increase 
the sensitivities to adverse changes in weighted average prepayment rates for the servicing assets are presented in note accounting for loan securitizations the company recognized a gain on sale of mortgage loans of million in the full year and million in included in these gains were gains resulting from the securitization of mortgage loans of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company also recognized a gain on the securitization of manufactured housing loans of million for the year ended december  concurrent with the decision to discontinue the manufactured housing lending business  the company will no longer securitize manufactured housing loans 
greenpoint s loan securitizations are completed through the use of qualifying special purpose entities qspe s 
in a securitization transaction  a pool of loans is sold to the qspe and securities supported by the cash flow from the transferred loans are sold by the qspe to third party investors 
funds received from the third party investors are returned to greenpoint as payment for the transferred loans 
the company may retain servicing rights and one or more retained interests and it may issue a letter of credit guaranteeing a portion of the credit losses in the loan pool 
the rules governing accounting for loan securitizations are established in fasb statement accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
the standard establishes the conditions which must be present for treating a transfer of financial assets as a sale  establishes the conditions which must be met to treat an entity as a qspe  and establishes the requirement to record and measure at fair value any retained interests associated with an asset transfer 
the standard also establishes that qspe s shall not be consolidated in the financial statements of the transferor 
greenpoint s asset transfers meet all of the conditions established for sale treatment and the spe s meet the conditions established for a qspe 
the transactions are deemed to be sales as the transferred assets are isolated from the company  the transferees are qualified spe s  and the company does not maintain effective control of the transferred assets 
in addition  the company has recorded all retained interests  including obligations under financial guarantees  at their estimated fair value per the requirements of statement no 
because market quotes are generally not available for retained interests  the company generally estimates fair value based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows using assumptions of prepayments  defaults  loss severity rates and discount rates the company believes market participants would use for similar assets and liabilities 
those assumptions are reviewed on a quarterly basis and changed based on actual and expected pool performance 
changes in the assumptions can result in a significant change to the value of retained interests 
in accordance with gaap disclosure requirements  note identifies the key economic assumptions underlying the valuation of retained interests and the potential dollar impact of adverse changes in those assumptions 
accounting for discontinued operations pursuant to its decision to discontinue the manufactured housing lending business  greenpoint s current and comparative prior period consolidated statements of income present the results of continuing operations and the discontinued business separately 
the consolidated statements of financial condition present the consolidation of both the continuing and discontinued operations 
the presentation is in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board statement no 
apb  which requires that the results of continuing operations be reported separately from discontinued operations and any gain or loss from disposal of a segment of a business be reported in conjunction with the related results of discontinued operations 
for the purposes of applying apb  the term segment of a business refers to a component of an entity whose activities represent a separate major line of business or class of customer 
the manufactured housing lending business was a separate major line of business with clearly separate operations and activities and a distinct customer base  and its activities can be clearly distinguished and measured for financial reporting purposes 
the manufactured housing business has been separately measured and disclosed in prior period business segment disclosures in the footnotes of the consolidated financial statements 
the company s plan to discontinue the business was reviewed and approved by management and the board of directors in december of the plan of discontinuation included the decision to cease accepting loan applications and fund only new loans pertaining to existing loan commitments 
accounting for the orderly liquidation or run off of the operation as a discontinued operation is consistent with apb and subsequent sec interpretations codified under topic z in accordance with the provisions of apb  the net loss reported for the year ended december  included the estimated performance of the discontinued operations during the phase out period 
the future results were estimated based on the company s best assessment of future operating performance  which included assumptions about the remaining life of the serviced loans and the operating costs associated with servicing those loans 
the future operating performance is reassessed on a quarterly basis and the underlying assumptions are amended when necessary to reflect changes in the estimated remaining life of the serviced loans  changing market conditions  and changes in the operating environment and cost structure of the servicing operation 
during the company funded only those loans on which it was committed to lend at december  at december  the company has no outstanding commitments to lend 
the company continues to honor its contractual commitment to service its current loan portfolio and during the company sold most of the remaining loans on its balance sheet 
regarding the residual interests associated with the previously securitized manufactured housing loans  the company reassesses the assumptions used in the valuation of these assets on a quarterly basis and incorporates the revised assumptions in its quarterly valuations 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements on april   the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas 
this statement rescinds statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishments of debt  which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of the related income tax effect 
sfas amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases  to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
this statement also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
management of the company anticipates that the adoption of sfas will not have a significant effect on the company s earnings or financial position 
on july   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred  rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  management of the company anticipates that the adoption of sfas will not have a significant effect on the company s earnings or financial position 
on october   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 acquisitions of certain financial institutions sfas 
except for transactions between two or more mutual enterprises  sfas removes acquisitions of financial institutions from the scope of both statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for certain acquisitions of banking or thrift institutions sfas and fasb interpretation no 
 applying apb opinions no 
and when a savings and loan association or a similar institution is acquired in a business combination accounted for by the purchase method and requires those transactions be accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
thus  the requirement in sfas to recognize and subsequently amortize any excess of the fair value of liabilities assumed over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired as an unidentifiable intangible asset no longer applies to acquisitions within the scope of sfas in addition  sfas amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to include in its scope long term customer relationship intangible assets of financial institutions such as depositor and borrower relationship intangible assets and credit cardholder intangible assets 
the transition provisions for previously recognized unidentifiable intangible assets were effective on october  the provisions related to the accounting for the impairment or disposal of certain long term customer relationship intangible assets were effective on october  the adoption of sfas did not have a significant effect on the company s earnings or financial position 
on december   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
this statement amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  beginning in the first quarter of management will comply with the additional disclosure provisions of sfas the company does not intend to adopt the fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options and the statement  therefore  will not have a significant effect on the company s earnings or financial position 
on november   the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin expands on the accounting guidance of fasb statements no 
 and this interpretation also incorporates without change the guidance in fasb interpretation no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which is being superseded 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of the guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements in fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  management of the company anticipates that the adoption of fin will not have a significant effect on the company s earnings or financial position 
on january   the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities  which have certain characteristics 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
this interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
fin applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  management of the company anticipates that the adoption of fin will not have a significant effect on the company s earnings or financial position 
the company has identified no transactions with variable interest entities which require consolidation or additional disclosure under fin item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk overview the company s market risk exposure is limited solely to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of the company s current and future earnings to changes in the level of market interest rates 
part of the company s interest rate risk resides on the balance sheet  as the maturity and repricing characteristics of its assets do not match those of its liabilities 
additionally  a significant source of the company s revenue  the proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans  depends on the volume of loan originations  which is sensitive to the level and direction of market interest rates 
market risk management process management of interest rate risk is conducted within policies and limits approved by the board of directors 
these policies and limits set forth the maximum risks to earnings and market value that the board of directors deems prudent 
in addition  they govern permissible investments and off balance sheet transactions  and maximum counterparty exposure limits 
the formulation and implementation of any risk management strategy involves numerous day to day decisions involving the acquisition or divestiture of loans and investment securities  reinvestment of cash flows  the selection of funding instruments and maturities and the use of off balance sheet instruments 
together  these incremental decisions result in a strategy that is represented by the interest rate risk position 
the performance of the positions and strategies are formally reviewed by the asset and liability management committee alco in the context of the outlook for interest rates and general business conditions  as well as for compliance with established risk tolerances and policies 
the committee is chaired by the chief financial officer and includes the treasurer  the head of risk management and the company s senior business unit and financial executives 
interest rate risk management strategies interest rate risk inherent on the balance sheet is managed taking into account the risks to earnings in the company s main businesses 
most importantly  the company s mortgage origination business is sensitive to the level of interest rates 
in a low or declining interest rate environment mortgage volumes tend to increase as demand for home purchases and mortgage refinancing increases  leading to growth in mortgage banking revenues 
conversely  high or rising rates subdue mortgage demand  leading to less revenue 
these dynamics tend to be partly offset by the sensitivity of retail banking revenues to changes in the level of interest rates 
typically in a high rate environment  spreads earned on retail deposits increase  as rates paid on those deposits increase more slowly than market rates in general 
additionally  the balance sheet is normally positioned to allow for higher net interest income and wider net interest margins as rates rise 
this is known as an asset sensitive balance sheet position  and provides a further offset to the interest rate cyclicality of mortgage banking revenue 
the interest rate sensitivity of the company s balance sheet originates with the cash flow characteristics of its loan portfolios and deposit products 
management alters the overall balance sheet sensitivity through adjustments to the securities investment portfolio and the maturities of market borrowings  as well as various deposit pricing and derivatives strategies 
interest rate risk measurement the principal tool used to measure balance sheet sensitivity at any point in time  and to assess the impact of potential business and rate risk management strategies  is a simulation of net interest income 
the simulation gives effect to management assumptions concerning the repricing of assets and liabilities  as well as business volumes under a variety of hypothetical interest rate scenarios 
these hypothetical scenarios incorporate parallel yield curve shifts in interest rates of plus or minus  and basis points 
in addition  non parallel yield curve flattening and steepening scenarios are modeled 
the most crucial management assumptions concern prepayments on the company s mortgage loan portfolio and the pricing of retail deposits in various interest rate environments 
as interest rates decline  mortgage prepayments tend to increase  reducing loan portfolio growth and lowering the portfolio s average yield 
management s assumptions are guided by analyzing the prepayment performance of the company s portfolio in past rate cycles as well as publicly available research on the prepayment behavior of similar mortgage assets 
rates on non maturity deposits rise and fall with market rates  but tend to move less than proportionately 
rates offered on retail certificates of deposit tend to move in close concert with market rates  though history suggests they increase less rapidly as market rates rise 
extensive historical analysis shows that the company s deposit volumes are relatively insensitive to interest rate movements within the range encompassed by the scenarios 
the following table presents the results of the simulations under a variety of hypothetical interest rate scenarios  based on the company s balance sheet position at december  the results are expressed as the percentage change in pretax net interest income from the base scenario in which interest rates are unchanged 
the change in income is measured over a period of twelve months 
short term rate changes yield curve bps bps bps parallel bps the columns represent basis point changes down and up in the level of short term interest rates over a twelve month time span 
the rows indicate changes in the shape of the yield curve over the same time period 
the parallel row corresponds to changes in rate levels in which the yield curve retains its shape 
in the basis point scenarios  the yield curve flattens  and in the basis point simulations the curve steepens 
for example  a parallel downward shift of basis points would reduce net interest income by from what would be earned if rates remained constant 
as of december  not all rates could fall basis points without reaching zero 
in these scenarios rates are reduced until they reach zero 
these scenarios are retained to allow for historical comparisons 
however  a decline of basis points at the short end of the yield curve  accompanied by a basis point steeper curve  would increase net interest income by over the unchanged scenario 
at december  a parallel basis point downward movement in interest rates was estimated to reduce net interest income by from the base case 
a parallel basis point rise in rates was estimated to benefit net interest income by 
the simulations measure the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates at a particular point of time 
the risk position is always changing 
management continuously monitors the company s risk profile as it changes  and alters the rate sensitivity to ensure limits are adhered to  and that the resulting risk profile is appropriate to its views on the likely course of interest rates and developments in its core businesses 
in addition  the fair value of the mortgage company s servicing assets and retained interests from securitizations are directly affected by the level of prepayments associated with the underlying loans 
as interest rates decline the value of these assets will decline 
conversely as interest rates rise  the value of these assets will increase 
derivative financial instruments interest rate derivatives  such as interest rate swaps and eurodollar futures  are periodically integrated into the company s interest rate positions and  therefore  its simulations 
the notional amount of these instruments are not included in the company s balance sheet 
there were no outstanding derivative financial instruments hedging the company s interest rate position at december  the company does currently utilize derivative instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risk associated with mortgage loan commitments and mortgage loans held for sale 
prior to the closing of the loan  the company generally extends an interest rate lock commitment to the borrower 
the company is exposed to subsequent changes in the level of market interest rates  and the spread over treasuries required by investors 
an increase in market interest rates or a widening of spreads will reduce the prices paid by investors and the resultant gain on sale 
to mitigate this risk  at the time the company extends the interest rate lock commitment to the borrower  the company will enter into mandatory commitments to deliver mortgage whole loans to various investors  or to issue private securities and or fannie mae and freddie mac securities forward delivery commitments 
these commitments effectively establish the price the company will receive for the related mortgage loan thereby minimizing the risk of subsequent changes in interest rates 
at december   the company had mandatory forward delivery commitments outstanding amounting to billion
