the company believes the decrease in the collection rate for western cbm operations is due to general recessionary trends in the economy 
the improvement in the collection rate for eastern cbm operations is due to stronger collections than originally anticipated at the acquisition of arch in april bad debt expense related to hbm operations and products division was not significant in either or general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   reflecting the impact of the arch transaction 
excluding arch expenses  general and administrative expenses increased  primarily due to additional support for expanded operations  merit pay increases  and changes in employee benefits retirement plan contributions and health insurance premiums as discussed more fully above in the analysis of flight center costs 
the company recognized a tax benefit of  in and no tax expense or benefit in primarily due to recognition of deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance had previously been provided 
based on the expected trend in taxable earnings  the majority of the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was reversed in as of december   a valuation allowance had been provided for net operating loss carryforwards which were not expected to be realized prior to expiration 
liquidity and capital resources the company had working capital of  as of december   compared to  at december  the change in working capital position is primarily attributable to the acquisition of rmh in october and to an increase in receivables consistent with increased revenue for cbm and hbm divisions 
the company had cash and cash equivalents of  as of december   compared to  at december  cash generated by operations increased to  in from  in primarily due to the acquisition of rmh and to improved pre tax profitability for the reasons discussed above in results of operations 
significant uses of cash in included an increase in receivables  net of bad debt expense  described above 
the balance of accrued overhaul and parts replacement costs grew during due to the increased level of flight volume for both cbm and hbm operations 
the accrual increases with each hour flown by the fleet and is offset when life limited aircraft components are actually replaced or overhauled 
cash used for investing activities totaled  in  compared to  in  reflecting the impact of the rmh acquisition 
other equipment acquisitions in consisted primarily of rotable equipment  medical interior and avionics installations  and upgrades for existing equipment 
significant acquisitions during included rotable equipment to replace fully depreciated items and upgrades to existing avionics equipment and aircraft interiors 
financing activities generated  in  compared to using  in primary uses of cash in both years consisted of payments for long term debt and capital lease obligations and purchases of common stock into treasury 
the company used proceeds from new note agreements originated in primarily to finance the acquisition of rmh and to pay off existing debt with a higher interest rate 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock increased in compared to primarily due to the higher stock price during the year  resulting in an increased number of stock option exercises 
repayment of debt and capital lease obligations as well as operating lease agreements constitute the company s long term commitments to use cash 
balloon payments on long term debt are due as follows  in  in  in  in  in the following table outlines the company s obligations for payments under its capital leases  debt obligations  and operating leases for the years ended december amounts in thousands 
capital leases minimum lease less net present long term operating total payments interest value debt leases obligations thereafter    total      the company has entered into various aircraft operating leases under which it provides residual value guarantees to the lessor 
as of december   the undiscounted maximum amount of potential future payments under the guarantees is  no amounts have been accrued for any estimated losses with respect to the guarantees  since it is not probable that the residual value of the aircraft will be less than the amounts stipulated in the guarantee 
the assessment of whether it is probable that the company will be required to make payments under the terms of the guarantee is based on current market data and the company s actual and expected loss experience 
senior revolving credit facility in october  the company entered into a million senior revolving credit facility with certain lenders to finance a portion of the purchase price and related closing costs for the rmh acquisition and to provide working capital and letter of credit availability for future activities of the company 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of the company s non aircraft assets  including accounts receivable  inventory  equipment and general intangibles

to if the termination occurs prior to october  indebtedness under the credit facility will bear interest  at the company s option  at either i the higher of the federal funds rate plus or the prime rate as announced by pnc plus an applicable margin ranging from to or ii a rate equal to libor plus an applicable margin ranging from to 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding balance against the line was 
the amount of borrowings permitted under the credit facility is based on a borrowing base comprised of i of accounts receivable from medicare  medicaid  insurance companies and community based payers and of other accounts receivable  and ii the lesser of a of inventory valued at the lower of cost or market  b of inventory valued at liquidation value  or c million

outlook for the statements contained in this outlook are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially 
the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
community based model the company opened cbm operations at new locations in alabama and illinois during the first quarter of cbm flight volume during at all other locations is expected to be consistent with historical levels attained by the company and rmh  subject to seasonal  weather related fluctuations 
the company continues to evaluate opportunities to expand the cbm model in other communities 
hospital based model four hospital contracts are due for renewal in the company expects flight activity for current hospital contracts to remain consistent with historical levels attained by the company and rmh 
products division as of december   the company was completing the production of mev units for the us army  with delivery of the remaining units scheduled for the first and second quarters of  and had received contracts to begin production of two modular medical interiors for two commercial customers 
remaining revenue for all contracts in process as of december   is estimated at  in the first quarter of  the company was also awarded new contracts valued at approximately  to manufacture modular medical interiors for three additional aircraft 
work on these contracts is expected to continue throughout the company expects to be awarded a contract for hh l multi mission medevac systems during  with delivery to be completed in the current us army aviation modernization plan defines a requirement for units in total over years beginning in the company also expects to receive a contract for additional mev litter systems in  with delivery to be completed in the us army has defined a requirement for a total of units over years  beginning with the units produced in there is no assurance that the current contract option for either program will be exercised or orders for additional units will be received in or in future periods 
all segments there can be no assurance that the company will successfully integrate rmh operations into its three divisions or continue to renew operating agreements for its hbm operations  generate new profitable contracts for the products division  or maintain flight volume for cbm operations 
based on the anticipated level of hbm and cbm flight activity and the projects in process for the products division  the company expects to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its operational needs throughout the company also has approximately  in borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit facility as of december  risk factors actual results achieved by the company may differ materially from those described in forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including but not limited to  those discussed above in outlook for and those described below 
rmh integration on october   the company acquired rmh  one of its competitors  effectively doubling the size of its operations 
while rmh is engaged in the same lines of business as air methods  it has operated in different geographic areas and under different procedures and protocols 
although most of rmh s employees will continue as employees of the company  few of its management level employees have remained with the company 
as with any large acquisition  a significant effort is required to assimilate the operations  financial and accounting practices  and mis systems  and to integrate key personnel from the acquired business 
this acquisition may cause disruptions in company operations and divert management s attention from day to day operations 
the company may not realize the anticipated benefits of this acquisition  profitability may suffer due to acquisition related costs or unanticipated liabilities  and the company s stock price may decrease if the financial markets consider the acquisition to be inappropriately priced 
highly leveraged balance sheet the company is obligated under debt facilities providing for up to approximately million of indebtedness  of which approximately million was outstanding at december  if the company fails to meet its payment obligations or otherwise defaults under the agreements governing indebtedness  the lenders under those agreements will have the right to accelerate the indebtedness and exercise other rights and remedies against the company 
these rights and remedies include the rights to repossess and foreclose upon the assets that serve as collateral  initiate judicial foreclosure against the company  petition a court to appoint a receiver for the company  and initiate involuntary bankruptcy proceedings against the company 
if lenders exercise their rights and remedies  the company s assets may not be sufficient to repay outstanding indebtedness  and there may be no assets remaining after payment of indebtedness to provide a return on common stock 
restrictive debt covenants the subordinated notes and senior credit facility  into which the company entered to finance the acquisition of rmh  both contain restrictive financial and operating covenants  including restrictions on the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  to exceed certain annual capital expenditure limits  and to engage in various corporate transactions such as mergers  acquisitions  asset sales and the payment of cash dividends 
these restrictions will restrict future growth through the limitation on capital expenditures and acquisitions  and may adversely impact the company s ability to implement its business plan 
failure to comply with the covenants defined in the agreements or to maintain the required financial ratios could result in an event of default and accelerate payment of the principal balances due under the subordinated notes and the senior credit facility 
flight volume all cbm revenue and approximately of hbm revenue is dependent upon flight volume 
approximately of the company s operating expenses also vary with number of hours flown 
poor visibility  high winds  and heavy precipitation can affect the safe operation of aircraft and therefore result in a reduced number of flight hours due to the inability to fly during these conditions 
prolonged periods of adverse weather conditions could have an adverse impact on the company s operating results 
typically  the months from november through february tend to have lower flight volume due to weather conditions and other factors  resulting in lower cbm operating revenue during these months 
flight volume for cbm operations can also be affected by the distribution of calls among competitors by local government agencies and the entrance of new competitors into a market 
collection rates the company responds to calls for air medical transport without pre screening the creditworthiness of the patient 
the cbm division invoices patients and their insurers directly for services rendered and recognizes revenue net of estimated contractual allowances 
the level of bad debt expense is driven by collection rates on these accounts 
collectibility is affected by the number of uninsured or indigent patients transported and is  therefore  primarily dependent upon the health of the us economy 
changes in estimated contractual allowances and bad debts are recognized based on actual collections in subsequent periods 
a significant or sustained downturn in the us economy could have an adverse impact on the company s bad debt expense 
dependence on third party suppliers the company currently obtains a substantial portion of its helicopter spare parts and components from bell helicopter  inc bell and american eurocopter corporation aec  because its fleet is composed primarily of bell and eurocopter aircraft  and maintains supply arrangements with other parties for its engine and related dynamic components 
based upon the manufacturing capabilities and industry contacts of bell  aec  and other suppliers  the company believes it will not be subject to material interruptions or delays in obtaining aircraft parts and components but does not have an alternative source of supply for bell  aec  and certain other aircraft parts 
failure or significant delay by these vendors in providing necessary parts could  in the absence of alternative sources of supply  have a material adverse effect on the company 
because of its dependence upon bell and aec for helicopter parts  the company may also be subject to adverse impacts from unusually high price increases which are greater than overall inflationary trends 
increases in the company s flight fees billed to its customers are generally limited to changes in the consumer price index 
aviation industry hazards and insurance limitations hazards are inherent in the aviation industry and may result in loss of life and property  thereby exposing the company to potentially substantial liability claims arising out of the operation of aircraft 
the company may also be sued in connection with medical malpractice claims arising from events occurring during a medical flight 
under hbm operating agreements  hospitals customers have agreed to indemnify the company against liability arising out of medical malpractice claims and to maintain insurance covering such liability  but there can be no assurance that a hospital will not challenge the indemnification rights or will have sufficient assets or insurance coverage for full indemnity 
in cbm operations  company personnel perform medical procedures on transported patients  which may expose the company to significant direct legal exposure to medical malpractice claims 
the company maintains general liability aviation insurance  aviation product liability coverage  and medical malpractice insurance  and believes that the level of coverage is customary in the industry and adequate to protect against claims 
however  there can be no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover potential claims or that present levels of coverage will be available in the future at reasonable cost 
a limited number of hull and liability insurance underwriters provide coverage for air medical operators 
a significant downturn in insurance market conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company s cost of operations 
approximately of any increases in hull and liability insurance may be passed through to the company s customers according to contract terms 
in addition  the loss of any aircraft as a result of accidents could cause both significant adverse publicity and interruption of air medical services to client hospitals  which could adversely affect the company s relationship with such hospitals and operating results 
governmental regulation the air medical transportation services and products industry is subject to extensive regulation by governmental agencies  including the federal aviation administration  which impose significant compliance costs on the company 
in addition  reimbursement rates for air ambulance services established by governmental programs such as medicare directly affect cbm revenue and indirectly affect hbm revenue from hospital customers 
changes in laws or regulations or reimbursement rates could have a material adverse impact on the company s cost of operations or revenue from flight operations 
foreign ownership federal law requires that united states air carriers be citizens of the united states 
for a corporation to qualify as a united states citizen  the president and at least two thirds of the directors and other managing officers of the corporation must be united states citizens and at least of the voting interest of the corporation must be owned or controlled by united states citizens 
if the company is unable to satisfy these requirements  operating authority from the department of transportation may be revoked 
furthermore  under certain loan agreements  an event of default occurs if less than of the voting interest is owned or controlled by united states citizens 
as of december   the company was aware of one foreign person who holds approximately of outstanding common stock 
because the company is unable to control the transfer of its stock  it is unable to assure that it can remain in compliance with these requirements in the future 
competition hbm operations face significant competition from several national and regional air medical transportation providers for contracts with hospitals and other healthcare institutions 
cbm operations also face competition from smaller regional carriers and alternative air ambulance providers such as sheriff departments 
operators generally compete on the basis of price  safety record  accident prevention and training  and medical capability of the aircraft offered 
the company s competition in the aircraft interior design and manufacturing industry comes primarily from two companies based in the united states and one in europe 
competition is based mainly on product features  performance  price  and weight 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully for new or renewing contracts in the future 
department of defense funding several of the projects which have historically been significant sources of revenue for the products division  including hh l and mev systems  are dependent upon department of defense funding 
failure of the us congress to approve funding for the production of additional hh l or mev units could have a material adverse impact on products division revenue 
shareholder dilution as of december   there were outstanding stock options to purchase approximately  shares of common stock and outstanding warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
to the extent that the outstanding stock options or warrants are exercised  dilution to the interest of common stockholders will occur 
moreover  the terms upon which the company will be able to obtain additional equity capital may be adversely affected since the holders of the outstanding options can be expected to exercise them at a time when any needed capital may be able to be obtained on terms more favorable than those provided in the outstanding options 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  uncollectible receivables  deferred income taxes  and aircraft overhaul costs 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition fixed flight fee revenue under the company s operating agreements with hospitals is recognized monthly over the terms of the agreements 
flight revenue relating to patient transports is recognized upon completion of the services 
revenue and accounts receivable are recorded net of estimated contractual allowances under agreements with third party payers 
estimates of contractual allowances are initially determined based on historical discount percentages for medicare and medicaid patients and adjusted periodically based on actual discounts 
if actual discounts realized are more or less than those projected by management  adjustments to contractual allowances may be required 
revenue related to fixed fee medical interior and products contracts is recorded as costs are incurred using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the company estimates the percentage of completion based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of an estimate of the total costs to complete the project 
certain products contracts provide for reimbursement of all costs plus an incremental amount 
revenue on these contracts is also recorded as costs are incurred 
losses on contracts in process are recognized when determined 
if total costs to complete a project are greater or less than estimated  the gross margin on the project may be greater or less than originally recorded under the percentage of completion method 
uncollectible receivables the company responds to calls for air medical transports without pre screening the credit worthiness of the patient 
uncollectible trade receivables are charged to operations using the allowance method 
estimates of uncollectible receivables are determined monthly based on historical collection rates and adjusted monthly thereafter based on actual collections 
if actual future collections are more or less than those projected by management  adjustments to allowances for uncollectible accounts may be required 
while bad debt expenses have historically been within expectations and the allowances established  there can be no guarantee that the company will continue to experience the same collection rates that it has in the past 
deferred income taxes in preparation of the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciable assets and maintenance reserves  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recoverable from future taxable income and records a valuation allowance for those amounts it believes are not likely to be realized 
establishing or increasing a valuation allowance in a period results in income tax expense in the statement of operations 
the company considers estimated future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made
