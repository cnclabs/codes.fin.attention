in  we commenced our capacity optimization enhancement program 
the objectives of this program are to increase company wide capacity utilization and operating efficiencies through consolidations and realignments of operations 
we believe that this program will result in future cost savings from the elimination of redundant facilities  employee reductions  and associated costs 
we are currently in the transition period and other locations are preparing to receive certain products from santa ana  therefore  the savings from the consolidations have not been realized in fiscal year in march  we closed microsemi ppc inc ppc

santa ana represents approximately of our annual shipments  occupies  square feet and has approximately employees 
the consolidation of santa ana is expected to result in minimal impact on shipments 
costs associated with the consolidation of santa ana are expected to range from million to million over the next to months 
these actions are  however  expected to result in annual cost savings of million to million 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to allowances related to revenue recognition  sale returns  doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  long live assets  accounting for income taxes and accounting for stock based compensation 
estimates and assumptions are based upon historical experience as well as various other factors that our management considers to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent there are material differences between estimates and actual results  our future financial position  results of operations and cash flow will be affected 
revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances we recognize revenue to all customers  including distributors  when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for substantially all sales  revenue is recognized at the time the product is shipped 
we enter into contracts with certain distributors which permit very limited stock rotation returns 
we provide an estimated allowance for such returns  and corresponding reductions in revenue are concurrently recorded  based on several factors including past history and notification from customers of pending returns 
actual returns have been within management s expectations 
in accordance with eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  estimated reductions to revenue are also recorded for customer incentive programs consisting of price protection and volume purchase rebates 
such programs are limited and actual reductions to revenue have been within management s expectations 
we provide a one year product defect warranty from the date of sale 
historically  warranty costs have been nominal 
for a further discussion of our accounting policies regarding revenue recognition see the section entitled our operating results may be affected to the extent actual results differ from accounting estimates under important factors related to forward looking statements and associated risks 
allowance for doubtful accounts we analyze specific customer accounts receivable  customer credit worthiness  historical bad debt expenses  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms and patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
actual bad debt has been within our expectations and the provisions established and are consistent with experience of prior years  however  any unexpected significant adverse financial position of any of our major customers or any group of customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of accounts receivable and future operating results 
for a further discussion of our accounting policies regarding reserves for bad debts see the section entitled our operating results may be affected to the extent actual results differ from accounting estimates under important factors related to forward looking statements and associated risks 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  as determined using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
costs include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we evaluate the carrying value of our inventories taking into account such factors as historical and anticipated future sales compared with quantities on hand and the price we expect to obtain for our products in their respective markets 
we also evaluate the composition of our inventories to identify any slow moving or obsolete products 
the total evaluations require material management judgments  including estimates of future sales  continuing market acceptance of our products  and market and economic conditions 
additionally  inventory reserves are established based upon such judgments for any inventories that are identified as having a net realizable value less than their cost  which is further reduced by related selling expenses 
historically  the net realizable value of our inventories has generally been within management s estimates 
however  if we are unable to meet our sales expectations  or if market conditions deteriorate from management s estimates  reductions in the net realizable value of our inventories could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
for a further discussion of our accounting policies regarding inventory valuation see the section entitled our operating results may be affected to the extent actual results differ from accounting estimates under important factors related to forward looking statements and associated risks 
long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from their use 
our long lived assets subject to this evaluation include property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets 
at september   other intangible assets include million of non patented technology and million of acquired customer lists for integrated products and million of non patented technology  million of covenants not to compete and million of contract manufacturer relationships 
we are required to make judgments and assumptions in identifying those events or changes in circumstances that may trigger impairment 
some of the factors we consider include significant decrease in the market value of an asset 
significant changes in the extent or manner for which the asset is being used or in its physical condition 
a significant change  delay or departure in our business strategy related to the asset 
significant negative changes in the business climate  industry or economic conditions 
current period operating losses or negative cash flow combined with a history of similar losses or a forecast that indicates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset 
an evaluation under fas includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining estimated useful lives 
if the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over the remaining estimated useful lives  we will record an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value 
as a result of our analysis  we will record a charge when we determine that our amortizable intangible assets or other long lived assets have been impaired 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
major factors that influence our cash flow analysis are our estimates for future revenue and expenses associated with the use of the asset 
different estimates could have a significant impact on the results of our evaluation 
goodwill all public companies have been required to adopt statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  which changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
we adopted this standard at the beginning of fiscal year consequently  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized  while those intangible assets with known useful lives will continue to be amortized over their respective useful lives 
at least annually  we are required to reassess goodwill 
whenever we determine that there has been an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives  we will record an impairment charge against earnings  which equals the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its then fair value and a reduction in goodwill on our balance sheet 
the identification of intangible assets and determination of the fair value and useful lives of goodwill and other intangible assets are subjective in nature and often involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the judgments made in determining the estimated useful lives assigned to each class of assets can significantly affect net income 
at the beginning of fiscal year  we had approximately million of unamortized goodwill and assembled work force that resulted from our previous acquisitions 
in fiscal year  as a result of the adoption of fas  we tested our goodwill under the reporting unit concept as of september  and determined that million was impaired 
as required by sfas no 
 a million impairment charge was recorded  net of its associated million tax benefit  as a cumulative change in accounting principle  effective as of september  on a going forward basis and in accordance with sfas  we will not amortize the remaining million of goodwill  however  up to of the remaining goodwill could be determined to be impaired during the evaluations required by fas see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we are required by fas to reassess goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
we performed our annual review for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal and tested for goodwill impairment in each reporting unit that contains goodwill 
reporting units with goodwill include scottsdale million and santa ana million 
we have determined that no impairment existed because the assets and liabilities that make up the reporting units at september  have not changed significantly since the most recent fair value determination 
the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin 
based on an analysis of events that have occurred and circumstances that have changed since the most recent fair value determination  the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is remote 
for a discussion of our accounting policies regarding long lived assets see the section entitled there may be goodwill impairments that would adversely affect microsemi under important factors related to forward looking statements and associated risks 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we have a nexus 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
we have established a valuation allowance for a portion of our deferred tax assets 
if we increase any valuation allowance in a period  it will adversely affect the tax provision in the income statement 
stock based compensation we account for employee stock options in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under apb  no compensation expense is recognized for stock options or restricted stock issued to employees with exercise prices at or above quoted market value 
statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas provides an alternative to apb in accounting for stock based compensation issued to employees 
sfas provides for a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options and similar equity instruments 
however  companies that continue to account for stock based compensation arrangements under apb are required by sfas to disclose the pro forma effect on net loss income and net loss income per share as if the fair value based method prescribed by sfas had been applied 
we continue to account for stock based compensation using the provisions of apb and present the pro forma information required by sfas as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas

results of operations for fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales decreased million or from million for fiscal year to million for fiscal year the decrease included million lower sales of space and commercial aircraft products  million lower sales to telecom and other commercial customers  partially offset by a million increase of sales of medical products 
the above decrease included the elimination of sales of rf  which had revenues of million in fiscal year and was sold in the third quarter of last year 
the decease in revenues in fiscal year reflected the general decline of the space  commercial aircraft and telecommunications markets

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations for fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales decreased million  or  from million for the fiscal year to million for the fiscal year the decrease was primarily attributable to lower demand for products in the commercial aircraft  commercial space  computers and mobile handsets markets  and the reduction or elimination of revenues generated by subsidiaries that were closed or sold  partially offset by the additions of mnes and mcdi

selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year included million in severance costs associated with our capacity optimization enhancement programs that did not qualify as restructuring costs under gaap

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and stock market 
we are exposed to various market risks  related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
we conduct business in a number of foreign currencies  principally those of europe and asia  directly or in our foreign operations 
we may receive some revenues in foreign currencies and purchase some inventory and services in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we are exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
transactions in foreign currencies have represented a relatively small portion of our business 
also these currencies have been relatively stable against the us dollar for the past several years 
as a result  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material impact historically on our revenues or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that those currencies will remain stable relative to the us dollar or that future fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies will not have material adverse effects on our results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
the largest foreign currency exposure of ours results from activity in british pounds and the european union euro 
we have not conducted a foreign currency hedging program thus far 
we have and may continue to consider the adoption of a foreign currency hedging program 
we did not enter into derivative financial instruments and did not enter into any other financial instruments for trading  speculative purposes or to manage our interest rate risk 
our other financial instruments consist primarily of cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and long term obligations 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short term investments and short term obligations 
as a result  we do not expect fluctuations in interest rates to have a material impact on the fair value of these instruments 
we do not engage in transactions intended to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates 
we currently have a  revolving line of credit  which expires in march it bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus to per annum or  at our option  at the eurodollar rate plus to per annum 
the interest rate is determined by the ratio of total funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
for instance  if we were to borrow presently the entire  from this credit line  a one percent increase in the interest rate would result in an additional  of pre tax interest expense annually 
at september    was utilized for a letter of credit  consequently   was available under this line of credit
