certain of the more critical assumptions include asset impairment determinations the intended use of assets and the expected future cash flows resulting directly from such use 
comparable market valuations of businesses similar to aramark s business segments 
industry specific economic conditions 
competitor activities and regulatory initiatives 
client and customer preferences and behavior patterns

sales growth in the education sector was in the high single digits  and the other sector which includes correctional and healthcare clients  experienced sales growth in the low double digits due primarily to increased volume at existing accounts 
the business services sector continued to be negatively affected by the weak economy  particularly weak employment levels 
while the economy has shown recent signs of recovery  we have not yet seen a meaningful increase in employment in the categories most important to this sector 
fiscal sales in this sector  excluding acquisitions  declined about from the prior year  an improvement over the prior year decline of 
sales in the sports and entertainment sector increased in the high single digits compared to the prior year  with sales increases due to new locations  higher attendance at mlb games and an increased number of nhl and nba games  being partially offset by a decline in visitations at national parks 
the facilities services sector sales growth excluding acquisitions was in the low single digits for the year  but improved to the high single digits in the fourth quarter of fiscal segment operating income increased compared to the prior year  with the million fourth quarter insurance proceeds and acquisitions contributing approximately and  respectively 
we also estimate the fiscal rd week contributed to operating income growth based on the seasonality of certain of our businesses 
strong performance in the education and other sectors and continued realization of synergies from the servicemaster acquisition were partially offset by significantly reduced profitability in the sports and entertainment sector due to decreased visitations at national parks  and the fine host post acquisition operating loss

see risk factors our business is contract intensive and may lead to client disputes 
uniform and career apparel rental segment uniform and career apparel rental segment fiscal sales increased compared to the prior year due to the impact of acquisitions and the rd week in sales increases from net new business have been offset by reduced volume at existing accounts 
sales growth in this segment continues to be significantly constrained by depressed employment levels  particularly in the manufacturing  automotive and airline sectors 
fiscal segment operating income  including the rd week  decreased compared to the prior fiscal year 
net new sales growth and modest price increases were substantially offset by contraction in the base business  and while cost control and operational improvement initiatives mitigated to a large extent normal operating cost increases  increased medical and fuel costs and a very competitive business environment put continued downward pressure on margins compared to the prior year 
uniform and career apparel direct marketing segment uniform and career apparel direct marketing segment sales in increased compared to the prior year

corporate corporate expenses  those administrative expenses not allocated to the business segments  were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due principally to a gain of million from a residual payment related to a previously divested entity 
increases in insurance and other costs were largely offset by the absence in fiscal of certain ipo related costs incurred in the prior year 
results of discontinued operations as discussed above  on may   the company closed the sale of its educational resources business to knowledge universe corporation for million in cash  subject to certain post closing adjustments

this condition is expected to continue to constrain growth in fiscal  particularly in the uniform rental segment and the tourist and convention services part of the us food business 
we have experienced significant increases in the cost of medical insurance programs and general liability insurance premiums

these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include unfavorable economic conditions  including ramifications of any future terrorist attacks  increased operating costs  shortages of qualified personnel or increases in labor costs  currency risks and other risks associated with international markets  risks associated with acquisitions  including acquisition integration costs  our ability to integrate and derive the expected benefits from our recent acquisitions  competition  decline in attendance at client facilities  unpredictability of sales and expenses due to contract terms and terminations  our business is contract intensive and may lead to client disputes  high leverage  claims relating to the provision of food services  costs of compliance with governmental regulations  liability associated with noncompliance with governmental regulations  including regulations pertaining to food services and the environment  inability to retain current clients and renew existing client contracts  customers reducing their outsourcing and use of preferred vendors  seasonality  and other risks that are set forth in this report under the caption risk factors 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date made 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect the events or circumstances arising after the date as of which they are made 
as a result of these risks and uncertainties  readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements included in this report or that may be made in other filings with the securities and exchange commission or elsewhere from time to time by  or on behalf of  us 
risk factors general unfavorable economic conditions and increased operating costs adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
each of our business segments has been adversely affected by weaker economic conditions in the united states during the past three fiscal years  including with respect to manufacturing  technology and service industry clients 
layoffs and business downturns among our business clients have negatively affected our sales 
a national or international economic downturn reduces demand for our services in each of our operating segments  which has resulted  and may in the future result  in the loss of business or increased pressure to contract for business on less favorable terms than our generally preferred terms 
in addition  any future terrorist attacks  and the national and global military  diplomatic and financial response to such attacks or other threats may adversely affect our sales and operating results 
our profitability could be adversely affected if we were faced with cost increases for food  fuel  utilities  insurance  wages  piece goods  clothing and equipment  especially to the extent we were unable to recover such increased costs through increases in the prices for our services  due to general economic conditions  competitive conditions  or both 
for example  substantial increases in the cost of fuel and utilities have historically resulted in substantial cost increases in our uniform services business  and to a lesser extent in our food and support services segment 
our business may suffer if we are unable to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if labor costs increase 
in the past  the united states has periodically experienced reduced levels of unemployment  which has created a shortage of qualified workers at all levels 
given that our workforce requires large numbers of entry level and skilled workers and managers  low levels of unemployment can compromise our ability in certain of our businesses to continue to provide quality service or compete for new business 
from time to time  we have had difficulty in hiring and maintaining qualified management personnel  particularly at the entry management level 
we will continue to have significant requirements to hire such personnel 
our success depends to a substantial extent on the ability  experience and performance of our management  particularly our chairman and chief executive officer  joseph neubauer  and our president and chief operating officer  william leonard 
effective january   william leonard will become aramark s president and chief executive officer and joseph neubauer will become aramark s executive chairman of the board of directors 
we also regularly hire a large number of part time workers  particularly in our food and support services segments 
any difficulty we may encounter in hiring such workers could result in significant increases in labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition for labor has resulted in wage increases in the past and future competition could substantially increase our labor costs 
due to the labor intensive nature of our businesses  a shortage of labor or increases in wage levels in excess of normal levels could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our expansion strategy involves risks 
we may seek to acquire companies or enter into joint ventures that complement our business  and our inability to complete acquisitions  integrate acquired companies successfully or enter into joint ventures may render us less competitive 
we may be evaluating acquisitions or engage in acquisition negotiations at any given time 
for example  in  we bought the assets of fine host corporation 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to identify acquisition candidates or joint venture partners on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we make additional acquisitions  we also cannot be sure that any benefits anticipated from the acquisitions will actually be realized 
likewise  we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary financing for acquisitions 
such financing could be restricted by the terms of our debt agreements or it could be more expensive than our current debt 
the amount of such debt financing for acquisitions could be significant and the terms of such debt instruments could be more restrictive than our current covenants 
in addition  our ability to control the planning and operations of our joint ventures and other less than majority owned affiliates may be subject to numerous restrictions imposed by the joint venture agreements and majority shareholders 
our joint venture partners may also have interests which differ from ours 
the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties  such as the failure to retain clients or management personnel and problems coordinating technology 
in addition  labor laws in certain countries may require us to retain more employees than would otherwise be optimal from entities we acquire 
such difficulties may divert significant financial  operational and managerial resources from our existing operations  and make it more difficult to achieve our operating and strategic objectives 
the diversion of management attention  particularly in a difficult operating environment  may affect our sales 
possible future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense  contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets  which could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition  operating results and or cash flow  or in the issuance of additional shares of our common stock 
requirements imposed by governmental regulations or interpretation of governmental regulations may change and require us to incur substantial expenditures to comply 
we are subject to governmental regulation at the federal  state  provincial and local level in many areas of our business  such as food safety and sanitation  the sale of alcoholic beverages  environmental issues and the services we provide in connection with governmentally funded entitlement programs 
while we endeavor to attain and maintain compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  governmental units may make changes in the regulatory frameworks within which we operate that may require either the corporation as a whole or individual businesses to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations 
while we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations  we cannot assure you that we are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws  regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations 
from time to time both federal and state governmental agencies have conducted audits of our billing practices as part of investigations of providers of services under governmental contracts  or otherwise 
like others in our business  we receive requests for information from governmental agencies in connection with these audits 
if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  we may be subject to criminal sanctions or civil remedies  including fines or injunctions 
the cost of compliance or the consequences of non compliance could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
changes in or new interpretations of the governmental regulatory framework may affect our contract terms and may reduce our sales or profits 
a portion of our sales  estimated to be approximately in fiscal  is derived from contracts with us federal  state and local governments and agencies 
changes or new interpretations in  or changes in the enforcement of  the statutory or regulatory framework applicable to services provided under governmental contracts or bidding procedures  particularly by our food and support services businesses  could result in fewer new contracts or contract renewals  modifications to the methods we apply to price government contracts  or in contract terms of shorter duration than we have historically experienced  any of which could result in lower sales or profits than we have historically achieved  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
our failure to retain our current clients and renew our existing client contracts could adversely affect our business 
our success depends on our ability to retain our current clients and renew our existing client contracts 
our ability to do so generally depends on a variety of factors  including the quality  price and responsiveness of our services  as well as our ability to market these services effectively and differentiate ourselves from our competitors 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew existing client contracts at the same or higher rates or that our current clients will not turn to competitors  cease operations  elect to self operate or terminate contracts with us 
the failure to renew a significant number of our existing contracts would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we may be adversely affected if customers reduce their outsourcing or use of preferred vendors our business and growth strategies depend in large part on the continuation of a current trend toward outsourcing services 
customers will outsource if they perceive that outsourcing may provide higher quality services at a lower overall cost and permit them to focus on their core business activities 
we cannot be certain that this trend will continue or not be reversed or that customers that have outsourced functions will not decide to perform these functions themselves 
in addition  labor unions representing employees of some of our current and prospective customers have occasionally opposed the outsourcing trend and sought to direct to union employees the performance of the types of services we offer 
we have also identified a trend among some of our customers toward the retention of a limited number of preferred vendors to provide all or a large part of their required services 
we cannot be certain that this trend will continue or not be reversed or  if it does continue  that we will be selected and retained as a preferred vendor to provide these services 
adverse developments with respect to either of these trends could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our international business results are influenced by currency fluctuations and other factors that are different than in the us market 
a significant portion of our sales is derived from international markets 
during fiscal  approximately of our sales were generated outside the united states 
the operating results of our international subsidiaries are translated into us dollars and such results are affected by movements in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
our international operations are also subject to other risks  including national and local regulatory requirements  potential difficulties in staffing and labor disputes  managing and obtaining support and distribution for local operations  credit risk or financial condition of local customers  potential imposition of restrictions on investments  potentially adverse tax consequences  including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  foreign exchange restrictions  and local political and social conditions 
there can be no assurance that the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
we intend to continue to develop our business in emerging markets over the long term 
emerging market operations present several additional risks  including greater fluctuation in currencies relative to the us dollar  economic and governmental instability  civil disturbances  volatility in gross domestic production  and nationalization and expropriation of private assets 
our operations are seasonal and quarter to quarter comparisons may not be a good indicator of our performance 
in the first and second fiscal quarters  within the food and support services united states segment  there historically has been a lower level of sales at the historically higher margin sports  entertainment and recreational food service operations  which is partly offset by increased activity in the educational sector 
in the third and fourth fiscal quarters  there historically has been a significant increase in sales at sports  entertainment and recreational accounts  which is partially offset by the effect of summer recess in the educational sector 
the sales of wearguard  one of our direct marketing companies  generally increase during the first quarter of the fiscal year because of the onset of colder weather in the northern tier of the united states as well as the gift giving holidays 
for these reasons  a quarter to quarter comparison is not a good indication of our performance or how we will perform in the future 
our indebtedness may restrict certain growth opportunities 
as of october   we had approximately billion of outstanding indebtedness 
the size of our indebtedness may restrict the pursuit of certain new business opportunities 
we will also have to use a portion of our cash flow to service our debt  which may prevent us from pursuing certain new business opportunities and certain acquisitions 
if we were to incur significant amounts of additional indebtedness in the future  the agreements relating to such indebtedness may include covenants more restrictive than our current debt agreements 
failure to satisfy financial and other covenants or make required debt payments could cause us to violate the terms of our credit facility agreements and thereby result in the exercise of remedies by our lenders  including acceleration of our indebtedness  impair our liquidity and limit our ability to raise additional capital 
food and support services competition in our industry could adversely affect our results of operations 
there is significant competition in the food and support services business from local  regional  national and international companies  of varying sizes  many of which have substantial financial resources 
our ability to successfully compete depends on our ability to provide quality services at a reasonable price and to provide value to our customers 
certain of our competitors may be willing to underbid us or accept a lower profit margin or expend more capital in order to obtain or retain business 
in addition  existing or potential clients may elect to self operate their food service  eliminating the opportunity for us to serve them or compete for the account 
while we have a significant international presence  should business sector clients require multi national bidding  we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage because we may not be able to offer services in as many countries as some of our competitors 
sales of sports  entertainment and recreational services would be adversely affected by a decline in attendance at client facilities or by a reduction or cessation of events 
the portion of our food and support services business which provides services in public facilities such as stadiums  arenas  amphitheaters  convention centers and tourist and recreational attractions is sensitive to an economic downturn  as expenditures to attend sporting events or concerts  take vacations  or hold or attend conventions are funded to a partial or total extent by discretionary income 
a decrease in such discretionary income on the part of potential attendees at events in our clients facilities could result in a reduction in our sales 
further  because our exposure to the ultimate consumer of what we provide is limited by our dependence on our clients to attract customers to their facilities and events  our ability to respond to such a reduction in attendance  and therefore our sales  is limited 
there are many factors that could reduce the numbers of events in a facility or attendance at an event  including labor disruptions involving sports leagues  poor performance by the teams playing in a facility and inclement weather  which would adversely affect sales and profits 
during fiscal  reduced visitation at certain of our national park service venues adversely affected our sales and operating income 
we anticipate that reduced visitation from historical levels will continue in fiscal the pricing and cancellation terms of our food and support services contracts may constrain our ability to recover costs and to make a profit on our contracts 
the amount of risk that we bear and our profit potential vary depending on the type of contract under which we provide food and support services 
we may be unable to fully recover costs on contracts that limit our ability to increase prices 
in addition  we provide many of our services under contracts of indefinite term  which are subject to termination on short notice by either party without cause 
some of our profit and loss contracts contain minimum guaranteed remittances to our client regardless of our sales or profit at the facility involved 
if sales do not exceed costs under a contract which contains minimum guaranteed commissions  we will bear any losses which are incurred  as well as the guaranteed commission 
generally  our contracts limit our ability to raise prices on the food  beverages and merchandise we sell within a particular facility without the client s consent 
in addition  some of our contracts exclude certain events or products from the scope of the contract  or give the client the right to modify the terms under which we may operate at certain events 
the refusal by individual clients to permit the sale of some products at their venues  or the imposition by clients of limits on prices which are not economically feasible for us  could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 
our business is contract intensive and may lead to client disputes 
our business is contract intensive and we are parties to many contracts with clients all over the world 
our client interest contracts which are described in the business section of this annual report  provide that client billings  and for some contracts the sharing of profits and losses  are based on our determinations of costs of service 
contract terms under which we base these determinations may be subject to differing interpretations which could result in disputes with our clients from time to time 
clients generally have the right to audit our contracts  and we periodically review our compliance with contract terms and provisions 
if clients were to dispute our contract determinations  resolution of such disputes in a manner adverse to aramark s interests could negatively affect sales and operating results 
while we do not believe any reviews  audits or other such matters would result in material adjustments  if a large number of our client arrangements were modified in response to any such matter  the effect could be materially adverse to our business or results of operations 
based on a recent internal review of certain client interest contracts in our international segment  we are working to adjust or clarify certain contractual arrangements 
fourth quarter operating results have been adjusted to reflect the possible effect of this effort 
see management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition food and support services international segment 
claims of illness or injury associated with the service of food and beverage to the public could adversely affect us 
claims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry  and a number of these claims may exist at any given time 
as a result  we could be adversely affected by negative publicity resulting from food quality or handling claims at one or more of the facilities that we serve 
in addition to decreasing our sales and profitability at our facilities  adverse publicity could negatively impact our service reputation  hindering our ability to renew contracts on favorable terms or to obtain new business 
in addition  future food product recalls and health concerns may from time to time disrupt our business 
in fiscal  one distributor provided approximately of our consolidated food and non food products  and if our relationship or their business were to be disrupted  we could experience short term disruptions to our operations and cost structure 
if our relationship with  or the business of  our main us distributor of our food and non food products were to be disrupted  we would have to arrange alternative distributors and our operations and cost structure could be adversely affected in the short term 
governmental regulations may subject us to significant liability 
our operations are subject to various governmental regulations  including those governing the service of food and alcoholic beverages  minimum wage and employment  governmentally funded entitlement programs  environmental protection  and human health and safety 
the regulations relating to each of our food and support service sectors are many and complex 
a variety of regulations at various governmental levels relating to the handling  preparation and serving of food including in some cases requirements relating to the temperature of food  and the cleanliness of food production facilities and the hygiene of food handling personnel are enforced primarily at the local public health department level 
we cannot assure you that we are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations 
furthermore  additional or amended regulations in this area may significantly increase the cost of compliance 
we serve alcoholic beverages at many facilities  and must comply with applicable licensing laws  as well as state and local service laws  commonly called dram shop statutes 
dram shop statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor 
if we violate dram shop laws  we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the patron 
although we sponsor regular training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation  we cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor patrons will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us 
there can be no assurance that additional regulation in this area would not limit our activities in the future or significantly increase the cost of regulatory compliance 
we must also obtain and comply with the terms of licenses in order to sell alcoholic beverages in the states in which we serve alcoholic beverages 
some of our contracts require us to pay liquidated damages during any period in which our liquor license for the facility is suspended  and most contracts are subject to termination if we lose our liquor license for the facility 
uniform and career apparel competition in the uniform rental industry could adversely affect our results of operations 
we have a number of major national competitors in the uniform rental industry with significant financial resources 
in addition  there are regional and local uniform suppliers whom we believe may have strong customer loyalty 
while most customers focus primarily on quality of service  uniform rental also is a price sensitive service and if existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices  we may be required to lower prices  which would reduce our sales and profits 
the uniform rental business requires investment capital for growth 
failure to maintain capital investment in this segment would put us at a competitive disadvantage 
environmental regulations may subject us to significant liability and limit our ability to grow 
our uniform rental segment is subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations  including the federal clean water act  clean air act  resource conservation and recovery act  comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act and similar state statutes and regulations 
in particular  we use and must dispose of wastewater containing detergent and other residues from the laundering of garments and other merchandise through publicly operated treatment works or sewer systems and are subject to volume and chemical discharge limits and penalties and fines for non compliance 
in the course of our business  we settle  or contribute to the settlement of  actions or claims brought against us relating to the disposal of hazardous materials 
we may have to expend material amounts to rectify the consequences of any such disposal in the future 
under environmental laws  as an owner or operator of real estate we may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in or emanating from our owned  leased or operated property  as well as related costs of investigation and property damage 
liability may be imposed upon us without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances 
there can be no assurances that locations which we own  lease or otherwise operate have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations or that future uses or conditions will not result in the imposition of liability upon us under such laws or expose us to third party actions such as tort suits 
in addition  such regulations may limit our ability to identify suitable sites for new or expanded plants 
in connection with our operations and the operations of our predecessors  hazardous or toxic substances may migrate from properties on which we operate to other properties 
we may be subject to significant liabilities to the extent that human health is damaged or the value of such properties is diminished by such migration 
the nature of our customer base could negatively impact our sales and operating results 
we supply uniform services to the airline  hospitality  retail and manufacturing industries  among others  all of which have been subject to one or more of shifting employment levels  changes in worker productivity  uncertainty regarding the impacts of rehiring and a shift to offshore manufacturing 
economic hardship among our client base could cause some of our clients to restrict expenditures or even cease to conduct business  both of which could negatively affect our sales and operating results
