general we are one of the leading providers of flexible healthcare staffing services  including nursing and ancillary services  to the uk healthcare industry 
we operate a community based network of over branches  with the capacity to provide nurses  carers known as home health aides in the us and specialized medical personnel to locations covering approximately of the population of great britain 
we provide healthcare staffing services to hospitals  local governmental authorities  nursing homes and private patients in the uk we also supply medical grade oxygen for use in respiratory therapy to the uk pharmacy market and to private patients in northern ireland 
on april   we disposed of the last of our us operations when we sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the promptcare companies  inc and steri pharm  inc 
for approximately  in cash 
these two subsidiaries constituted our us home healthcare operations segment 
our home healthcare operations were concentrated in new york and new jersey and supplied infusion therapy  respiratory therapy and home medical equipment 
the sale of this non core segment allows us to focus our business on providing staffing services to the healthcare industry 
in accordance with the provisions of fas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we have accounted for our home healthcare operations as a discontinued operation 
our consolidated financial statements reflect the assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations as separate line items and the operations of our home healthcare operations for the current and prior periods are reported in discontinued operations on our income statement 
on july   we consummated the reorganization 
pursuant to the reorganization  equity investments in twuk and subordinated debt investments in allied healthcare uk were exchanged for shares of our common stock and shares of our new series a preferred stock 
the net effect of the reorganization was that twuk became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of our company and the principal amount of the senior subordinated notes the notes issued by allied healthcare uk were exchanged for shares of our series a preferred stock 
the primary purpose of the reorganization was our desire to increase shareholder value by having us and our subsidiaries be viewed as one company by the marketplace 
other objectives of the reorganization were to streamline our corporate structure  improve the potential for equity financings in order to take advantage of attractive opportunities in the us healthcare staffing services market and effectively convert the equity and subordinated debt investments in our uk subsidiaries into direct investments in us 
we believe that the reorganization resulted in our company having a more straight forward and integrated management and corporate structure 
in the reorganization  accrued and unpaid interest owed to the holders of the notes issued by allied healthcare uk was satisfied by the exchange for shares of our common stock at the rate of shares for every pound of accrued and unpaid interest on such notes 
we issued  shares of common stock in settlement of accrued and unpaid interest on the notes in fiscal and an additional  shares of common stock in settlement of accrued and unpaid interest on the notes were issued in the first quarter of fiscal in the reorganization  we issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and  shares of our series a preferred stock 
the series a preferred stock has an aggregate liquidation preference of  on our balance sheet  the shares of common stock have been valued at per share  the closing price on amex of our common stock at april   the date of the execution of the agreement relating to the reorganization  and the shares of series a preferred stock issued in connection with the reorganization have been valued at  excluding issuance costs 
at issuance  as the value of a share of common stock into which a share of series a preferred stock was convertible was less than the conversion price  there was no economic incentive for a holder of series a preferred stock to convert and  accordingly  there was no beneficial conversion feature in the series a preferred stock under accounting principles generally accepted in the us our revenue mix and payor mix is influenced to a significant degree by the relative contribution of acquired businesses and their respective payor profiles 
the following table shows the percentage of historical net revenues represented by each of our product lines year ended year ended year ended september  september  september  product line net patient services net respiratory  medical equipment and supplies total revenues the following table shows the historical payor mix for our total revenues for the periods presented year ended year ended year ended september  september  september  payor uk nhs and other uk governmental uk private payors total revenues the decrease in nhs and other uk governmental payors as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended september  as compared to was primarily due to a decrease in billable rates per hour achieved in the nhs due to the introduction of the framework agreements  together with a migration of nursing placements into private nursing homes where higher margins were achieved 
the increase in nhs and other uk governmental payors as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended september  as compared to was primarily due to our uk acquisitions  which derive the majority of their revenues from the nhs  and to organic growth in the core flexible staffing business 
we believe that our payor mix in the future will be determined primarily by the payor profile of completed acquisitions and to a lesser extent  from shifts in existing business among payors 
our gross margins will be influenced by the revenue mix of our product lines and by changes in reimbursement rates 
subsequent acquisitions  when completed  will continue to impact the relative mix of revenues and overall gross margin 
at september   we had  of intangible assets primarily goodwill on our balance sheet compared to  at september  this represented of total assets and of total stockholders equity at september  and of total assets and of total stockholders equity at september  in accordance with the provisions of fas no 
 which we adopted effective october   all existing and newly acquired goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not subject to amortization 
amortization of other intangibles still subject to amortization was  for the year ended september  subsequent acquisitions  when completed  will continue to increase the amount of intangible assets on the balance sheet 
critical accounting policies accounts receivable we are required to estimate the collectibility of our accounts receivables  which requires a considerable amount of judgment in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
significant changes in required reserves may occur in the future as we continue to expand our business and as conditions in the marketplace change 
intangible assets we have significant amounts of goodwill 
the determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant amount of judgment 
changes in strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and may require adjustments to recorded amounts of goodwill 
in addition  goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter 
however  a more frequent evaluation would be performed if indicators of impairment were present 
deferred income taxes we account for deferred income taxes based upon differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
the determination of whether or not valuation allowances are required to be recorded involves significant estimates regarding the future profitability of our company  as well as potential tax strategies for the utilization of net loss and operating loss carry forwards 
contingencies related to our acquisitions of certain flexible staffing agencies  we have entered into agreements to pay additional amounts  in cash  as contingent consideration dependent upon future earnings of such acquired entities 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended september  also  we are involved in various legal proceedings and claims incidental to our normal business activities 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
revenue recognition patient services and respiratory therapy revenues are recognized when services are performed and substantiated by proper documentation 
for patient services  which are billed at fixed rates and account for over of our company s business  revenue is recognized upon completion of timesheets that also require the signature of the recipient of services 
revenues from the rental of home medical equipment including respiratory equipment are recognized over the rental period typically on a month to month basis 
revenues from the sale of oxygen and supplies for use in respiratory therapy are recognized when products are shipped  a contractual arrangement exists  the sales price is either fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
we receive a majority of our revenue from the nhs and other uk governmental payors 
certain revenues are subject to review by third party payors and adjustments  if any  are recorded when determined

the decrease was also attributable to reduced bank debt as well as a reduction in interest rates 
the decrease was partially offset by the recording of a  charge related to a change in the fair value of our company s interest rate cap and floor collar agreement

excluding this benefit  the provision for income taxes would have been  or of income before income taxes and discontinued operations for the year ended september  the difference between the effective tax rate for the year ended september  and the statutory tax rate is primarily due to our recording of an additional valuation allowance for the tax benefit associated with the current year s us operating loss

year ended september  revenues total revenues for the year ended september  were  compared to  for the year ended september   an increase of  or excluding the favorable effects of changes in foreign exchange

as a percentage of total revenue  gross profit for the year ended september  decreased to from for the comparable prior period 
gross margins for patient services decreased for the year ended september  versus for the comparable prior period principally due to an increase in the percentage of revenues derived from the staffing of nurses and other more highly paid professionals  which have lower margins than the historical carer business 
in addition  uk regulatory changes  which extend the entitlement of holiday pay to temporary workers  served to reduce gross margins in the year ended september  gross margins in the respiratory  medical equipment and supplies sales increased for the year ended september  versus for the comparable prior period mainly due to the sales mix

provision for income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes amounting to  or of income before income taxes and minority interest for the year ended september  versus a provision of  for the year ended september  the difference between the effective tax rate for the year ended september  and the statutory tax rate is due to our recording of an additional valuation allowance for the tax benefit associated with the fiscal us operating loss 
we had been previously committed to implementing tax strategies that provided for the sale of appreciated assets  including a portion of our ownership interest in our uk subsidiary  to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the tax net operating losses prior to their expiration 
while we believe we will eventually realize the value of our tax losses  current developments  including the continued expansion of our uk operations has increased the uncertainty as to both the execution of the original strategy and the appropriateness of a tax strategy which may not align with our current business strategy 
these uncertainties have impaired our ability to determine whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  a full valuation allowance for all remaining deferred tax assets was provided

the increase in the accounts receivable from to is mainly due to the acquisition of medic one  a supplier of temporary staffing to nhs hospitals and private hospitals in the uk  which was slightly offset by the timing of cash collections 
our goal is to maintain accounts receivable levels equal to or less than industry average  which would tend to mitigate the risk of negative cash flows from operations by reducing the required investment in accounts receivable and thereby increasing cash flows from operations
