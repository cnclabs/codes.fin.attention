item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks described in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
you should read the following discussion with the selected financial data and our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we operate in three segments exploration and production  natural gas distribution and marketing  transportation and other 
our financial results depend on a number of factors  in particular natural gas and oil prices  the seasonality of our customers need for natural gas and our ability to market natural gas and oil on economically attractive terms to our customers 
there has been significant price volatility in the natural gas and crude oil market in recent years 
the volatility was attributable to a variety of factors impacting supply and demand  including weather conditions  political events and economic events we cannot control or predict 
our net income decreased from million in  or per share on a fully diluted basis  to million  or per share in this decrease in net income was primarily a result of the negative impact of lower realized natural gas and oil prices on the operating income of our e p segment 
a decrease in the operating income for our gas distribution segment also negatively impacted our net income in in  we reported a net loss of million  which included one time charges for a million judgment we paid in connection with the hales lawsuit and million related to other litigation  a loss on the early retirement of debt  and a million gain from the sale of our missouri utility properties 
exclusive of these one time charges and the gain on sale  net income for would have been million  or per share 
revenues were million in  a decrease of from million in  primarily reflecting lower realized natural gas and oil prices 
revenues in decreased to million from million in  reflecting lower volumes sold to unaffiliated parties by the marketing segment 
this decline in volumes reflects our increased focus on marketing our own production and limiting the marketing of third party volumes in an effort to reduce our credit risk

excluding these unusual items  operating income for the e p segment would have been million for 
table of contents revenues  operating income and production revenues 
our exploration and production revenues decreased in to million compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to lower prices received for natural gas 
revenues increased in to million from million in the increase was primarily due to increased natural gas and oil production and higher natural gas and oil prices 
operating income 
operating income from our exploration and production segment was million in compared to million in  and million in  excluding the impact of the hales judgment and other unusual items charged that year 
the decrease in was primarily due to the decrease in revenues caused by the lower realized natural gas and oil prices 
the increase in was due to an increase in natural gas and oil production and higher prices realized  partially offset by increased operating costs and expenditures 
production 
gas and oil production totaled bcfe in  bcfe in and bcfe in overall production in was up slightly over as increased production from our overton field properties in east texas and from our gulf coast properties more than offset production declines in our arkoma basin and permian basin properties  and the sale of our non strategic mid continent properties in the fourth quarter of the increase in production volumes resulted from successful exploration and development of our south louisiana properties  the development of our overton field and increased production in the arkoma basin 
gas sales to unaffiliated purchasers were bcf in  up from bcf in and bcf in sales to unaffiliated purchasers are primarily made under contracts that reflect current short term prices and are subject to seasonal price swings 
intersegment sales to arkansas western were bcf in  bcf in and bcf in the increase in intersegment sales resulted from increased deliveries to arkansas western under our baseload contracts 
the decrease in sales in was caused by arkansas western s reduced supply requirements due to warmer weather and the sale of the utility s missouri gas distribution properties in may weather in  as measured in degree days  was warmer than normal and colder than the prior year 
weather in was warmer than both normal and the prior year and was normal in our gas production provided approximately of the utility s requirements in  in and in future sales to arkansas western s gas distribution systems will be dependent upon our success in obtaining gas supply contracts with the utility systems 
in the future  we will continue to bid to obtain these gas supply contracts  although there is no assurance that we will be successful 
if successful  we cannot predict the amount of fixed demand charges  if any  that would be associated with the new contracts 
we expect future increases in our gas production to come primarily from sales to unaffiliated purchasers 
we are unable to predict changes in the market demand and price for natural gas  including changes that may be induced by the effects of weather on demand of both affiliated and unaffiliated customers for our production 
additionally  we hold a large amount of undeveloped leasehold acreage and producing acreage  and have an inventory of drilling leads  prospects and seismic data that will continue to be evaluated and developed in the future 
our exploration programs have been directed primarily toward natural gas in recent years 
commodity prices the average price realized for our gas production was per mcf in  per mcf in  and per mcf in the changes in the average price realized primarily reflect changes in average annual spot market prices and the effects of our price hedging activities 
our hedging activities lowered the average gas price per mcf in  per mcf in  and per mcf in in  the price was reduced per mcf due to million of basis differential ineffectiveness associated with our cash flow hedges 
there was no significant ineffectiveness recorded in additionally  we have historically received monthly demand charges related to sales made to our utility segment  which has increased the average gas price realized 
we periodically enter into hedging activities with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas and crude oil production through a variety of financial arrangements intended to support natural gas and oil prices at targeted levels and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations we refer you to item a of this form k and note to the financial statements for additional discussion 
our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings 
at december   we had hedges in place on bcf of gas production 
subsequent to december  and prior to february   we hedged an additional bcf of future gas production 
at december  we had hedges in place on  barrels of future oil production 
subsequent to 
table of contents december  and prior to february   we hedged an additional  barrels of future oil production 
as of february   we have hedged approximately of our anticipated gas production level and of our anticipated oil production level 
disregarding the impact of hedges  we would normally expect the average price received for our gas production to be approximately to per mcf lower than average spot market prices  as market differentials that reduce the average prices received are partially offset by demand charges received under the contracts covering our intersegment sales to our utility systems 
future changes in revenues from sales of our gas production will be dependent upon changes in the market price for gas  access to new markets  maintenance of existing markets  and additions of new gas reserves 
we realized an average price of per barrel for our oil production for the year ended december   down from per barrel for and per barrel for our hedging activities lowered the average oil price per barrel in  per barrel in and per barrel in disregarding the impact of hedges  we expect the average price received for our oil production to be approximately lower than posted spot market prices 
operating costs and expenses lease operating expenses per mcfe for this business segment were in and  compared to in taxes other than income taxes per mcfe were in  compared to in and in the increases in per unit lease operating expenses in and were due to increased workover expenses and changes in the geographic mix of production 
lease operating expense per unit should decrease in the future as a result of increased production from our overton field lower average cost as compared to other areas  decreased production in permian basin properties higher average cost as compared to other areas and the sale of our mid continent properties that had the highest average cost per unit of all operating areas 
the increases in and taxes other than income taxes per mcfe were due to increased severance and ad valorem taxes that resulted from generally higher commodity prices and from the changing mix of production among taxing jurisdictions 
general and administrative expenses per mcfe were in  compared to in and in the increase in general and administrative costs per mcfe in was due primarily to increased legal costs related to the resolution of litigation approximately per mcfe 
excluding the impact of these litigation costs in  general and administrative costs in were higher per unit due to increased pension  insurance and salary costs 
our full cost pool amortization rate averaged per mcfe for  compared to in and in the rate increased in and  due primarily to negative revisions of proved reserves that resulted from a decline in average gas prices and to a million decline in in the balance of unevaluated costs excluded from amortization in the full cost pool 
unevaluated costs excluded from amortization have declined from million at the beginning of to million at the end of we utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our natural gas and oil properties 
under this method  all such costs productive and nonproductive are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method 
these capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test  however  which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved gas and oil reserves discounted at percent standardized measure plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties 
any costs in excess of this ceiling are written off as a non cash expense 
the expense may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
full cost companies must use the prices in effect at the end of each accounting quarter to calculate the ceiling value of their reserves 
at december   and  our unamortized costs of natural gas and oil properties did not exceed this ceiling amount 
at december   our standardized measure was calculated based upon quoted market prices of per mcf for gas and per barrel for oil  adjusted for market differentials 
a decline in natural gas and oil prices from year end levels or other factors  without other mitigating circumstances  could cause a future write down of capitalized costs and a non cash charge against future earnings 
in november  we sold our remaining non strategic mid continent properties  including our properties in the sho vel tum area in southern oklahoma  the anadarko basin in western oklahoma and the sooner trend in northwestern oklahoma  for a total of million 
these properties represented approximately bcfe of reserves and produced approximately bcfe annually 
we expect this divestiture to result in a decrease in our future average production costs per unit of production 

table of contents in  our subsidiary  sepco  formed a limited partnership with an investor to drill and complete development wells in sepco s overton field located in smith county  texas 
the overton properties were acquired by sepco in april and have multiple development locations through the downspacing of the existing producing units 
because sepco is the sole general partner and owns a majority interest in the partnership  operating and financial results for the partnership are consolidated with our other operations and the investor s share of the partnership activity is reported as a minority interest item in the financial statements 
during and  the minority interest owner in the partnership contributed million and million  respectively  in capital to the limited partnership 
the investor s share of and revenues  less operating costs and expenses  was million and million  respectively 
inflation impacts us by generally increasing our operating costs and the costs of our capital additions 
the effects of inflation on our operations prior to have been minimal due to low inflation rates 
however  during both and  the impact of inflation intensified in certain areas of our exploration and production segment as shortages in drilling rigs  third party services and qualified labor developed due to an overall increase in the activity level of the domestic natural gas and oil industry 
we feel this impact has been decreasing in with the relative stabilization of commodity prices 
additionally  southwestern has mitigated rising costs in certain situations by obtaining vendor commitments to multiple projects and by offering incentives to vendors for cost reduction efforts that directly impact the amount we pay for their services 
natural gas distribution the operating results of our gas distribution segment are highly seasonal and the extent and duration of heating weather significantly impacts the profitability of this segment  although we have a weather normalization clause that lessens the impact of revenue increases and decreases which might result from weather variations during the winter heating season 
the gas distribution segment s profitability is also dependent upon the timing and amount of regulatory rate increases that are filed with and approved by the apsc 
for periods subsequent to allowed rate increases  our profitability is impacted by our ability to manage and control this segment s operating costs and expenses 
year ended december  in thousands except for per mcf amounts revenues gas purchases operating costs and expenses operating income deliveries bcf sales and end use transportation off system transportation average number of customers average sales rate per mcf heating weather degree days percent of normal data for includes the operations of the missouri properties through the sale date of may  excluding the missouri operations  operating income would have been million in revenues and operating income gas distribution revenues fluctuate due to the effects of warm weather on demand for natural gas and the pass through of gas supply cost changes 
because of the corresponding changes in purchased gas costs  the revenue effect of the pass through of gas cost changes has not materially affected net income 

table of contents gas distribution revenues decreased in and decreased in the decrease in was primarily due to a lower average sales rate caused by lower gas prices 
the decrease in was due to the loss of revenues resulting from the sale of the utility s missouri assets in may and the effects of warmer weather  partially offset by a higher average sales rate caused by higher gas prices 
weather during in the utility s service territory was warmer than normal and colder than the prior year  and was warmer than both normal and the prior year in weather was normal in operating income for our utility systems decreased in and in the decrease in resulted from increased operating costs and expenses and reduced usage per customer due to customer conservation brought about by high gas prices in the decrease in operating income for this segment resulted from the full year impact of the sale of the utility s missouri assets  the effects of warmer weather that were not fully offset by the weather normalization clause in its tariffs and increased bad debt expense caused by record high natural gas prices experienced in the first part of deliveries and rates in  arkansas western sold bcf to its customers at an average rate of per mcf  compared to bcf at per mcf in and bcf at per mcf in additionally  arkansas western transported bcf in  bcf in and bcf in for its end use customers 
the decrease in volumes sold in resulted from customer conservation brought about by high gas prices in and from several industrial customers moving from system supply to transportation  partially offset by customer growth 
the decrease in volumes sold and transported in resulted from the sale of the utility s missouri properties in and warmer weather 
arkansas western s tariffs contain a weather normalization clause to lessen the impact of revenue increases and decreases which might result from weather variations during the winter heating season 
the fluctuations in the average sales rates reflect changes in the average cost of gas purchased for delivery to our customers  which are passed through to customers under automatic adjustment clauses 
total deliveries to industrial customers of the utility segment  including transportation volumes  were bcf in  bcf in and bcf in the increase in deliveries in resulted from industrial growth in the region 
the decline in deliveries in resulted from warmer heating weather and the sale of the utility s missouri assets 
arkansas western also transported bcf of gas through its gathering system in compared to bcf in both and for off system deliveries  all to the ozark gas transmission system 
the level of off system deliveries each year generally reflects the changes of on system demands of our gas distribution systems for our gas production 
the average off system transportation rate was approximately per mcf  exclusive of fuel  in and  and per mcf in gas distribution revenues in future years will be impacted by the utility s gas purchase costs  customer growth and rate increases allowed by the apsc 
in recent years  arkansas western has experienced customer growth of approximately to annually in its northwest arkansas service territory  while it has experienced little or no customer growth in its service territory in northeast arkansas 
based on current economic conditions in our service territories  we expect this trend in customer growth to continue 
operating costs and expenses the changes in purchased gas costs for the gas distribution segment reflect volumes purchased  prices paid for supplies  the mix of purchases from various gas supply contracts base load  swing and no notice and the sale of missouri assets as discussed above 
operating costs and expenses increased in as compared to due to general inflationary effects and increased pension and insurance expenses 
other operating costs and expenses of the gas distribution segment decreased in as compared to due to the sale of the utility s missouri assets 
operating costs in also included increased bad debt expense caused by high natural gas prices in the winter heating season 
in october  arkansas western instituted a competitive bidding process for its gas supply 
additionally  arkansas western annually submits its gas supply plan to the general staff of the apsc 
as a result of the bidding process under the plan filed for the gas purchase year  seeco successfully bid on gas supply packages representing approximately two thirds of the requirements for arkansas western for the contracts awarded to seeco expire through arkansas western enters into hedging activities from time to time with respect to its gas purchases to 
table of contents protect against the inherent price risks of adverse price fluctuations 
we refer you to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks and note to the financial statements for additional information 
inflation impacts our gas distribution segment by generally increasing our operating costs and the costs of our capital additions 
the effects of inflation on the utility s operations in recent years have been minimal due to low inflation rates 
additionally  delays inherent in the rate making process prevent us from obtaining immediate recovery of increased operating costs of our gas distribution segment 
regulatory matters arkansas western s rates and operations are regulated by the apsc 
arkansas western operates through municipal franchises that are perpetual by virtue of state law  but are not exclusive within a geographic area 
although its rates for gas delivered to its retail customers are not regulated by the ferc  its transmission and gathering pipeline systems are subject to the ferc s regulations concerning open access transportation 
as the regulatory focus of the natural gas industry has shifted from the federal level to the state level  some utilities across the nation have unbundled residential sales services from transportation services in an effort to promote greater competition 
no such legislation or regulatory directives related to natural gas are presently pending in arkansas 
in arkansas  the state legislature enacted act for the deregulation of the retail sale of electricity by act was modified by act of delaying the implementation of electric deregulation to not earlier than october and no later than october in december  the apsc submitted its annual report to the arkansas legislature on the development of electric deregulation and recommended that the legislature consider suspending deregulation to the year or  or repeal act as modified by act 
furthermore  legislation has been recently introduced seeking to repeal the deregulation of the retail sale of electricity 
it is unknown what final legislation will be adopted or  if it is adopted  what its final form will be 
if electric deregulation occurs in arkansas  legislative or regulatory precedents may be set that would also affect natural gas utilities in the future 
these issues may include further unbundling of services and the regulatory treatment of stranded costs 
arkansas western has historically maintained a substantial price advantage over electricity for most applications 
this has enabled the utility to achieve excellent market penetration levels 
however  during the high gas prices experienced in the heating season temporarily eroded the price advantage 
arkansas western has made progress in regaining price advantage in its markets as gas prices have declined from the levels experienced in the winter of arkansas western filed an application with the apsc on november   for a rate increase of million annually 
the apsc has ten months to reach a decision on the amount of an allowed rate increase 
as a result  any increase granted will become effective no later than september arkansas western s last rate increase was approved in december for the utility s northwest region and in december for the northeast region 
the apsc approved increases of million and million  respectively 
during  the apsc initiated a proceeding in which it sought a million reduction in the rates for the northwest region 
in late  the apsc and arkansas western reached a settlement in which the northwest region s rates were reduced by million 
the reduction was primarily due to a downward adjustment to the return on equity that the apsc had established in the rate case 
rate increase requests  which may be filed in the future  will depend on customer growth  increases in operating expenses  and additional investment in property  plant and equipment 
while arkansas western continues to experience customer growth and has controlled its costs  its return on investment has declined in recent years 
in february  the apsc approved a day temporary tariff to collect additional gas costs not yet billed to customers through the utility s normal purchased gas adjustment clause in its approved tariffs 
we had significant under recovered purchased gas costs as a result of the high prices paid for gas supply in the heating season 
the temporary tariff allowed the utility accelerated recovery of these gas costs 
in april  arkansas western filed a revised purchased gas adjustment clause that provides better matching between the time the gas costs are incurred and the time the costs are recovered 
the apsc approved the new clause in may in april  the apsc adopted natural gas procurement plan rules for utilities 
these rules require utilities to take all reasonable and prudent steps necessary to develop a diversified gas supply portfolio 
the portfolio should consist of an appropriate combination of different types of gas purchase contracts and or financial hedging instruments that are designed to yield an optimum balance of reliability  reduced volatility and reasonable price 
utilities will be required to submit on an annual basis their gas supply plan  along with their contracting and or hedging objectives  to the staff of the 
table of contents apsc for review and determination as to whether it is consistent with these policy principles 
if the plan includes a hedging strategy and it is determined to be consistent with the objectives of the policy principles  utilities will be allowed to flow any hedging gain or loss to customers through the purchased gas adjustment clause 
during  arkansas western submitted its annual gas supply plan for the heating season and a revision to its purchased gas adjustment clause for the recovery of hedging gains and losses to the staff of the apsc 
in may  arkansas western submitted its annual gas supply plan for the heating season 
arkansas western also purchases gas from unaffiliated producers under take or pay contracts 
we believe that we do not have a significant exposure to liabilities resulting from these contracts and expect to be able to continue to satisfactorily manage our exposure to take or pay liabilities 
marketing  transportation and other operating income from the marketing  transportation and other segment  which includes income from real property held by our subsidiary  aw realty company  was million in  compared to million in and million in ebitda for these segments was million in  compared with million in and million in for a further discussion of our ebitda reconciliation  we refer you to business other items reconciliation of non gaap measures 
marketing year ended december  revenues in millions operating income in millions gas volumes marketed bcf our operating income from marketing was million on revenues of million in  compared to million on revenues of million in  and million on revenues of million in we marketed bcf in  compared to bcf in and bcf in the decline in total volumes marketed in and resulted primarily from the decline in volumes marketed to third parties 
this reduction reflects our increased focus on marketing our own production and limiting the marketing of third party volumes in an effort to reduce our credit risk 
of the total volumes marketed  purchases from our exploration and production subsidiaries accounted for in  in and in we enter into hedging activities from time to time with respect to our gas marketing activities to provide margin protection 
we refer you to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks and note to the financial statements for additional discussion 
transportation the marketing  transportation and other segment also manages our interest in noark 
at december   arkansas western had transportation contracts with ozark pipeline for mmcf per day of firm capacity 
these contracts expire in and are renewable annually thereafter until terminated with days notice 
noark and arkansas western are currently renegotiating these contracts 
our recorded pre tax loss from operations included in other income related to our noark investment was million in  million in  and million in the improvements in operating results since result primarily from noark s ability to collect higher transportation rates on interruptible volumes 
we believe that we will be able to continue to reduce the losses from noark and expect our investment in noark to be realized over the life of the system 
we refer you to note to the financial statements for additional discussion 
we have severally guaranteed the debt service on a portion of noark s outstanding debt 
noark s outstanding debt was million at december   and our share of the guarantee was million 
this debt financed a portion of the original cost to construct the noark pipeline 
we were not required to advance any funds to noark in  and advanced million in primarily for debt service 
we refer you to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources off balance sheet arrangements and note to the financial statements for further discussion of our guarantee of noark debt 

table of contents in january  ozark pipeline sold a mile portion of its pipeline system located in oklahoma that had limited strategic value to the overall system 
sales proceeds to noark were million 
we received million of cash proceeds from this sale and will record a gain of approximately million in other income  costs and expenses interest costs  net of capitalization  were down in and down in  both as compared to prior years 
interest costs for have been restated from prior years presentations to reflect costs incurred for the early extinguishment of debt 
these costs were previously presented as a net of tax extraordinary item but have been reclassed for presentation purposes as required by sfas no 
interest costs were down in due to lower average borrowings and a lower average interest rate 
a decrease in interest costs in that resulted from lower average borrowings  a lower average interest rate and the early extinguishment of debt costs discussed above  was partially offset by a lower level of capitalized interest related to our natural gas and oil properties 
interest capitalized decreased in and in the reductions in capitalized interest are primarily due to the level of costs excluded from amortization in our exploration and production segment 
other income expense in resulted from our share of noark s results of operations  as discussed above  and interest costs on customer deposits in the gas distribution segment 
other income expense in resulted from our share of noark s results of operations  offset by interest income in the gas distribution segment related to under recovered gas purchase costs 
other income in resulted from a million gain on the sale of our missouri gas distribution assets and gains from the sale of other miscellaneous assets  partially offset by our share of noark s results of operations 
the hales judgment was the primary cause for our deferred tax benefit of million in excluding this impact  the changes in the provision for deferred income taxes recorded each year result primarily from the level of taxable income  the collection of under recovered purchased gas costs  abandoned property costs  and the deduction of intangible drilling costs in the year incurred for tax purposes  netted against the turnaround of intangible drilling costs deducted for tax purposes in prior years 
intangible drilling costs are capitalized and amortized over future years for financial reporting purposes under the full cost method of accounting 
we recorded pension expense of million in and a credit to expense of million in the amount of pension expense recorded by us is determined by actuarial calculations and is also impacted by the funded status of our plans 
at december  our pension plans were underfunded and a liability of million was recorded on the balance sheet 
as a result of the underfunded status and actuarial data to be completed in early  we expect to record pension expense of million to million in for further discussion of our pension plans  we refer you to note to the financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we depend on internally generated funds and our revolving line of credit discussed below under financing requirements as our primary sources of liquidity 
we may borrow up to million under our revolving credit facility from time to time 
as of february   we had million of indebtedness outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
we expect our capital expenditures discussed below under capital expenditures for to exceed the funds generated by our operations and the funds that may be available under our credit facility 
in december  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec pursuant to which we may from time to time during  subject to market conditions  publicly offer equity  debt or other securities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million in in  net cash used in operating activities was million as a result of the hales judgment and the impact of high year end gas prices on working capital 
the primary components of cash generated from operations are net income  depreciation  depletion and amortization  the provision for deferred income taxes and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
net cash from operating activities provided of our capital requirements for routine capital expenditures in  and over in 
table of contents our cash flow from operating activities is highly dependent upon market prices that we receive for our gas and oil production 
the price received for our production is also influenced by our commodity hedging activities  as more fully discussed in quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks and note to the financial statements 
natural gas and oil prices are subject to wide fluctuations 
as a result  we are unable to forecast with certainty our future level of cash flow from operations 
we adjust our discretionary uses of cash dependent upon cash flow available 
if we are unable to raise funds in the capital markets in early as planned  we will be required to adjust our planned level of investment in capital projects in the e p segment 
this  in turn  could negatively impact growth in production volumes and cash flow from operations  which could ultimately affect our ability to meet the covenants contained in the indentures governing our public debt as well as our revolving credit facility agreement 
we do not anticipate being unable to meet our covenants and commitments 
see financing requirements for further discussion of our debt covenants 
capital expenditures capital expenditures totaled million in  million in  and million in our exploration and production segment expenditures included acquisitions of interests in natural gas and oil producing properties totaling million in  million in and million in our reported capital investments in and include the gross expenditures in the overton field partnership discussed previously 
the owner of the minority interest in the overton partnership funded million and million of our exploration and development expenditures during and  respectively 
in thousands exploration and production gas distribution other capital investments planned for total approximately million  consisting of million for exploration and production  million for gas distribution system improvements and million for general purposes 
we expect that this level of capital investments in will allow us to accelerate the development of our overton field properties in east texas  maintain our present markets  explore and develop other existing gas and oil properties  generate new drilling prospects  and finance improvements necessary due to normal customer growth in our gas distribution segment 
as discussed above  our capital investment program is expected to be funded through cash flow from operations  our revolving credit facility  and  subject to market conditions  one or more possible public offerings of equity  debt or other securities 
we may adjust our level of future capital investments dependent upon our ability to consummate such offerings and our level of cash flow generated from operations 
off balance sheet arrangements as discussed above in results of operations  we hold a general partnership interest in noark and account for our investment under the equity method of accounting 
we and the other general partner of noark have severally guaranteed the principal and interest payments on noark s notes due this debt financed a portion of the original cost to construct the noark pipeline 
our share of the guarantee is 
at december  and  the outstanding principal amount of these notes was million and million  respectively 
our share of the guarantee was million and million  respectively 
the notes were issued in june and require semi annual principal payments of million 
under the several guarantee  we are required to fund our share of noark s debt service which is not funded by operations of the pipeline 
we were not required to advance any funds to noark in  and advanced million in primarily for debt service 
our share of the results of operations included in other income related to our noark investment were losses of million in  million in  and million in the improvements in operating results since result primarily from the ability to collect higher transportation rates on interruptible volumes 
we believe that we will be able to continue to reduce the losses we have experienced on the noark project and expect our investment in noark to be realized over the life of the system see note of the financial statements for additional discussion 

table of contents noark s assets and liabilities as december  and are as follows in thousands current assets noncurrent assets current liabilities long term debt partners capital noark s results of operations for  and are summarized below in thousands operating revenues pre tax net income loss contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments we have assumed various contractual obligations and contingent commitments in the normal course of our operations and financing activities 
significant contractual obligations at december  are as follows contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than total year to years to years years in thousands long term debt operating leases unconditional purchase obligations demand charges other long term obligations we lease office space in houston  texas  office space in tulsa  oklahoma  and approximately twenty vehicles under operating leases expiring through our utility segment has volumetric commitments for the purchase of gas under competitive bid packages and wellhead contracts 
volumetric purchase commitments at december  totaled bcf  comprised of bcf in less than one year  bcf in one to three years  
bcf in three to five years and 
bcf in more than five years 
our volumetric purchase commitments are priced at regional gas indices set at the first of each future month 
these costs are recoverable from the utility s end use customers 
our utility segment has commitments for demand charges on firm gas purchase and firm transportation agreements 
these costs are recoverable from the utility s end use customers 
our significant other contractual obligations for include approximately million of land leases  approximately million for drilling rig commitments and approximately of various information technology support agreements 
we refer you to financing requirements below for a discussion of the terms of our long term debt 

table of contents contingent liabilities or commitments 
we have the following commitments and contingencies that could create  increase or accelerate our liabilities 
substantially all of our employees are covered by defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans 
our return on the assets of these plans in was negative which  combined with other factors  is expected to result in an increase in pension expense and our required funding of the plans for at december  we recorded an accrued pension benefit liability of million 
as a result of the underfunded status and actuarial data to be completed in early  we expect to record pension expense of million to million in see note to the financial statements for additional information 
as discussed above in off balance sheet arrangements  we have guaranteed of the principal and interest payments on noark s notes due at december  the principal outstanding for these notes was million 
the notes require semi annual principal payments of million 
see note to the financial statements for additional information 
financing requirements our total debt outstanding was million at december  and million at december  in july  we arranged an unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks to replace our previous short term credit facility that was put in place in july the revolving credit facility has a maximum capacity of million and expires in july at december   we had million of outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility  with million of borrowing availability 
the interest rate on the new facility is calculated based upon our debt rating 
we are currently paying basis points over libor 
we have also entered into interest rate swaps for calendar year that allow us to pay a fixed average interest rate of based upon current rates under the revolving credit facility on million of our outstanding revolving debt 
our revolving credit facility contains covenants  which impose certain restrictions on us 
under the credit agreement at december   we may not issue total debt in excess of of our total capital  must maintain a certain level of shareholders equity  and must maintain a ratio of ebitda to interest expense at or above 
effective march   the percentage of debt to total capital covenant decreases to and the minimum ratio of ebitda to interest expense covenant increases to these covenants continue to change over the term of the credit facility and generally become more restrictive 
we were in compliance with our debt agreements at december  although we do not anticipate debt covenant violations  our ability to comply with our debt agreements is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control  such as the market prices for natural gas and oil 
in  we publicly issued million of medium term notes due and million of medium term notes due in  we publicly issued million of notes due in our publicly traded notes are rated bbb by standard and poor s and ba by moody s 
during  moody s downgraded our public debt from our previous baa rating 
the interest rate under the revolving credit facility increased basis points in july as the result of the downgrade of our public debt by moody s 
further downgrades of our public debt could increase the costs of funds under our revolving credit facility 
in december  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec for the purpose of qualifying the potential sale from time to time of up to an aggregate million of equity  debt and other securities 
in june  the noark partnership issued million of notes due the notes require semi annual principal payments of million that began in december we account for our investment in noark under the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the results of noark 
we and enogex  the other general partner of noark  have severally guaranteed the principal and interest payments on the noark debt 
our share of the several guarantee is and amounted to million at december  we did not advance any funds to noark in in  we advanced million to noark to fund its share of debt service payments 
if noark is unable to generate sufficient cash in the future to service our debt and we are required to contribute cash to fund our share of the debt service guarantee  we could be required to record our share of the noark debt commitment under current accounting rules 
at the end of  our capital structure consisted of debt excluding our several guarantee of noark s obligations and equity  with a ratio of ebitda to interest expense of 
ebitda is a measure required by our debt covenants and is defined 
table of contents as net income plus interest expense  income tax expense  and depreciation  depletion and amortization 
shareholders equity in the december  balance sheet includes an accumulated other comprehensive loss of million related to our hedging activities that is required to be recorded under the provisions of sfas no 
this amount is based on current market values of our hedges at december  and does not necessarily reflect the value that we will receive when the hedges are ultimately settled  nor does it take into account revenues to be received associated with the physical delivery of sales volumes hedged 
our debt covenants as to capitalization percentages exclude the effects of non cash entries that result from sfas no 
as well as the non cash impact of any full cost ceiling write downs 
our capital structure  including our several guarantee of noark s obligations  would be debt and equity at december  without consideration of the accumulated other comprehensive loss related to sfas no 
as part of our strategy to insure cash flow to fund our operations and meet the restrictive covenant tests under our debt agreements  we have hedged approximately of our expected gas production and of our expected oil production 
the amount of long term debt we incur is dependent upon commodity prices and our capital expenditure plans 
if commodity prices remain at or near current levels throughout and our capital expenditure plans do not change from current expectations  we do not expect to materially reduce our long term debt in if commodity prices significantly decrease  we may incur additional long term debt to fund our capital expenditure plans or we may modify our capital expenditure plans 
we refer you to business other items reconciliation of non gaap measures in item of part i of this form k for a table that reconciles ebitda with our operating income as derived from our audited financial information 
working capital we maintain access to funds that may be needed to meet seasonal requirements through our credit facility described above 
we had positive working capital of million at the end of and million at the end of current assets decreased by in and current liabilities increased 
the decrease in current assets at december  was due primarily to decreases in amounts recorded in accordance with sfas no 
for derivative activities  and decreases in accounts receivable  inventories and cash 
decreases in accounts payable and over recovered purchased gas costs in current liabilities were more than offset by increases in amounts recorded as current liabilities for derivative activities 
at december   we had over recovered purchased gas costs of million 
critical accounting policies natural gas and oil properties we utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our natural gas and oil properties 
we review the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties under the full cost accounting rules of the sec on a quarterly basis 
under these rules  all such costs productive and nonproductive are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method 
these capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test  however  which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved gas and oil reserves discounted at percent plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties 
if the net capitalized costs of natural gas and oil properties exceed the ceiling  we will record a ceiling test write down to the extent of such excess 
a ceiling test write down is a non cash charge to earnings 
if required  it reduces earnings and impacts shareholders equity in the period of occurrence and results in lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in future periods 
the write down may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties increases when natural gas and oil prices are depressed or if there are substantial downward revisions in estimated proved reserves 
application of these rules during periods of relatively low oil or natural gas prices  even if temporary  increases the probability of a ceiling test write down 
based on natural gas and oil prices in effect on december   the unamortized cost of our natural gas and oil properties did not exceed the ceiling of proved natural gas and oil reserves 
natural gas pricing has historically been unpredictable and any significant declines could result in a ceiling test write down in subsequent quarterly or annual reporting periods 

table of contents natural gas and oil reserves used in the full cost method of accounting cannot be measured exactly 
our estimate of natural gas and oil reserves requires extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and is generally less precise than other estimates made in connection with financial disclosures 
assigning monetary values to such estimates does not reduce the subjectivity and changing nature of such reserve estimates 
the uncertainties inherent in the disclosure are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of production and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves 
we engage the services of an independent petroleum consulting firm to review reserves as prepared by our reservoir engineers 
hedging we use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates 
our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings 
the primary market risks related to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil 
however  the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the natural gas or sale of the oil that is hedged 
our derivative instruments are accounted for under sfas no 
and are recorded at fair value in our financial statements 
we utilize market based quotes from our hedge counterparties to value these open positions 
these valuations are recognized as assets or liabilities in our balance sheet and  to the extent an open position is an effective cash flow hedge on equity production or interest rates  the offset is recorded in other comprehensive income 
results of settled commodity hedging transactions are reflected in natural gas and oil sales or in gas purchases 
results of settled interest rate hedges are reflected in interest expense 
any ineffective hedge  derivative not qualifying for accounting treatment as a hedge  or ineffective portion of a hedge is recognized immediately in earnings 
future market price volatility could create significant changes to the hedge positions recorded in our financial statements 
we refer you to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this form k for additional information regarding our hedging activities 
regulated utility operations our utility operations are subject to the rate regulation and accounting requirements of the apsc 
allocations of costs and revenues to accounting periods for ratemaking and regulatory purposes may differ from those generally applied by non regulated operations 
such allocations to meet regulatory accounting requirements are considered generally accepted accounting principles for regulated utilities provided that there is a demonstrated ability to recover any deferred costs in future rates 
during the ratemaking process  the regulatory commission may require a utility to defer recognition of certain costs to be recovered through rates over time as opposed to expensing such costs as incurred 
this allows the utility to stabilize rates over time rather than passing such costs on to the customer for immediate recovery 
this causes certain expenses to be deferred as a regulatory asset and amortized to expense as they are recovered through rates 
the regulatory commission has not required any unbundling of services  although large industrials are free to contract for their own gas supply 
there are no regulations relating to unbundling of services currently anticipated  however  should such regulation be proposed and adopted  certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria for deferred recognition and  accordingly  a write off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required 
pension accounting we record our prepaid or accrued benefit cost  as well as our periodic benefit cost  for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans using measurement assumptions that we consider reasonable at the time of calculation see note to the financial statements for further discussion and disclosures regarding these benefit plans 
two of the assumptions that affect the amounts recorded are the discount rate  which estimates the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled  and the expected return on plan assets  which reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested 
for  the discount rate assumed is and the expected return assumed is 
this compares to a discount rate of and an expected return of used in using the assumed rates discussed above  we recorded pension expense of million in and a credit to expense of million in we reflected a pension liability of million at december  and a prepaid benefit cost of million at december  
table of contents assuming a change in the rates lower discount rate and lower rate of return  we would have recorded pension expense of million in  and recorded an accrued pension liability of million at december  gas in underground storage we record our gas stored in inventory that is owned by the exploration and production segment at the lower of weighted average cost or market 
gas expected to be cycled within the next months is recorded in current assets with the remaining stored gas reflected as a long term asset 
the quantity and average cost of gas in storage was bcf at at december  and bcf at at december  the gas in inventory for the exploration and production segment is used primarily to supplement production in meeting the segment s contractual commitments including delivery to customers of our gas distribution business  especially during periods of colder weather 
as a result  demand fees paid by the gas distribution segment to the exploration and production segment  which are passed through to the utility s customers  are a part of the realized price of the gas in storage 
in determining the lower of cost or market for storage gas  we utilize the gas futures market in assessing the price we expect to be able to realize for our gas in inventory 
declines in the future market price of natural gas could result in us writing down our carrying cost of gas in storage

forward looking statements include the items identified in the preceding paragraph  information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations and other statements in this prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus identified by words such as anticipate  project  intend  estimate  expect  believe  predict  budget  projection  goal  plan  forecast  target or similar expressions 
you should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
they are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may affect our operations  markets  products  services and prices and cause our actual results  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
in addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with forward looking statements  risks  uncertainties and factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward looking statement include  but are not limited to the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for natural gas and oil  the timing and extent of our success in discovering  developing  producing  and estimating reserves  our future property acquisition or divestiture activities  the effects of weather and regulation on our gas distribution segment  increased competition  the impact of federal  state and local government regulation

we caution you that these forward looking statements are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control  incident to the exploration for and development  production and sale of natural gas and oil 
these risks include  but are not limited to  commodity price volatility  third party interruption of sales to market  inflation  lack of availability of goods and services  environmental risks  drilling and other operating risks  regulatory changes  the uncertainty inherent in estimating proved natural gas and oil reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures and the other risks described in this form k 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact way 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data and the interpretation of that data by geological engineers 
in addition  the results of drilling  testing and production activities may justify revisions of estimates that were made previously 
if significant  these revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling 
accordingly  reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered 
should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described above or elsewhere in this form k occur  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements 
we specifically disclaim all responsibility to publicly update any information contained in a forward looking statement or any forward looking statement in its entirety and therefore disclaim any resulting liability for potentially related damages 
all forward looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s market risks relating to our operations result primarily from the volatility in commodity prices  basis differentials and interest rates  as well as credit risk concentrations 
we use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates 
the board of directors has approved risk management policies and procedures to utilize financial products for the reduction of defined commodity price and interest rate risks 
these policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings 
credit risks our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables and derivative contracts associated with commodities trading 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas 
no single customer accounts for greater than of accounts receivable 
see the discussion of credit risk associated with commodities trading below 
interest rate risk the following table provides information on our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents our debt obligations  principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
variable average interest rates reflect the rates in effect at december  for borrowings under our credit facility 
our policy is to manage interest rates through use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
interest 
table of contents rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate 
we have entered into interest rate swaps for the calendar year that allow us to pay a fixed average interest rate of based upon current rates under the revolving credit facility on million of our outstanding revolving debt 
expected maturity date fair value thereafter total in millions fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate commodities risk we use over the counter natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options to hedge sales of our production  to hedge activity in our marketing segment  and to hedge the purchase of gas in our utility segment against the inherent price risks of adverse price fluctuations or locational pricing differences between a published index and the nymex  futures market 
these swaps and options include transactions in which one party will pay a fixed price or variable price for a notional quantity in exchange for receiving a variable price or fixed price based on a published index referred to as price swaps  transactions in which parties agree to pay a price based on two different indices referred to as basis swaps  and the purchase and sale of index related puts and calls collars that provide a floor price below which the counterparty pays production hedge or receives gas purchase hedge funds equal to the amount by which the price of the commodity is below the contracted floor  and a ceiling price above which we pay to production hedge or receives from gas purchase hedge the counterparty the amount by which the price of the commodity is above the contracted ceiling 
the primary market risks related to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil 
however  the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the natural gas or sale of the oil that is hedged 
credit risk relates to the risk of loss as a result of non performance by our counterparties 
the counterparties are primarily major investment and commercial banks which management believes present minimal credit risks 
the credit quality of each counterparty and the level of financial exposure we have to each counterparty are periodically reviewed to ensure limited credit risk exposure 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in commodity prices 
the table presents the notional amount in bcf and mbbls  the weighted average contract prices  and the total dollar contract amount by expected maturity dates 
the carrying amount for the contract amounts is calculated as the contractual payments for the quantity of gas or oil to be exchanged under futures contracts and does not represent amounts recorded in our financial statements 
the fair value represents values for the same contracts using comparable market prices at december  at december   the carrying amount exceeded the fair value of these financial instruments by million
