item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from those described below  including those risks described in the section entitled  business risk factors  and elsewhere in this annual report 
our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of document sciences and its subsidiary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  computer software costs  allowance for doubtful accounts and valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from our estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
initial license fees are recognized when a contract exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  software delivery has occurred and collection of the receivable is deemed probable 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue for all of our license models 
our contracts specifically state the amount of initial and annual license fees due for each type of software licensed 
if an undelivered element of the arrangement exists under the license arrangement  revenue is deferred based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered element 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  all revenue is deferred until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
we recognize revenue on transactions with payment terms greater than days but less than twelve months from the contract date  if we have a history of successfully collecting from the specific customer without providing concessions 
amounts billed or payments received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
we work in conjunction with our established vars  with whom we have formal contracts defining the rights and obligations of the parties  to license software to end users 
we license software to our vars  less a discount  from a fixed price list 
we require a binding purchase order as evidence of an unconditional order by an end user from our vars  with no rights of return or acceptance 
license revenue from our vars is recognized when software is licensed to an end user 
annual renewal license and support fees alf are recognized ratably over the contract period 
included in our alf are unspecified maintenance releases 
our contracts do not provide for specific upgrades 
our standard contracts do not provide for rights of return or conditions of acceptance  however  in the rare case that acceptance criteria are provided  revenue is deferred and not recognized until all conditions are satisfied and written customer acceptance is obtained 
we believe this approach to revenue recognition  when acceptance criteria exist  would not result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
revenues generated from consulting services are recognized as the related services are performed and collectibility is deemed probable 
however  when such consulting services are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the delivered software product  revenue from the entire arrangement is recognized on a percentage of completion method or not until the contract is completed in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and accounting research bulletin arb no 
 long term construction type contracts 
we measure progress under the percentage of completion method  depending on how the contract language is written  either by using the percentage of total project hours completed or by the completion of phases in the consulting project 
because i the phases of our consulting projects are generally not of great duration weeks on average and ii we have a variety of projects progressing at the same time  we believe that there are very limited circumstances where materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 

table of contents we consider our anticipated revenue levels when making decisions about our operating expenses 
since a high percentage of those expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in the recognition of revenue from license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter  and we may sustain losses as a result 
since revenue may not be recognized in the same quarter as when shipment occurs and if such fixed expenses are incurred before we recognize revenues for these shipments  our operating results would be materially adversely affected 
software development costs 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and significant enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility of the product has been established 
after technological feasibility has been established  direct production costs  including programming and testing  are capitalized until general release of the product 
capitalized costs of software to be sold  licensed or otherwise marketed are amortized using the greater of the amount computed using the ratio of current period product revenues to estimated total product revenues or the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic lives of the products 
it is possible that estimated total product revenues  the estimated economic life of the product  or both  will be reduced in the future 
as a result  the carrying amount of capitalized software costs may be reduced in the future  which could cause our operating results in future periods to be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would result in an additional general and administrative expense in the period such determination was made 
at the end of each reporting period  we perform a rigorous review of outstanding balances by customer and invoice 
we utilize statistical and account specific analysis to determine the adequacy of our reserve  as well as comparing balances to historical losses 
if our assumptions or analysis are incorrect  our operating results for future periods may be adversely affected 
deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
due to the uncertainty of realizing a portion of these net deferred tax assets  we have maintained a valuation allowance of million for net deferred tax assets 
such uncertainty primarily relates to the potential for future taxable income as well as loss carryforwards and tax credits expiring in and  respectively 
in addition  pursuant to sections and of the internal revenue code  annual use of our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited in the event of a cumulative change in ownership of more than within a three year period 
no valuation allowance has been recorded to offset the remaining  of net deferred tax assets as we have determined that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized during the year ending december  we will continue to assess the likelihood of realization of such assets  however  if future events occur which do not make the realization of such assets more likely than not  we will record a valuation allowance against all or a portion of these net deferred tax assets 
an example of a future event that may occur which would make the realization of such assets not likely is a lack of taxable income resulting from poor operating results 

table of contents results of operations for the years ended december   and the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial data as a percentage of total revenues years ended december  revenues initial license fees annual renewal license and support fees services and other total revenues cost of revenues initial license fees annual renewal license and support fees services and other total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income  net income before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income revenues total revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and an increase of from to our revenues are divided into three categories based upon the sources from which they are derived initial license fees  annual renewal license and support fees  and services and other revenues 
initial license fees consist primarily of upfront license fees for the first year of use of our products 
annual renewal license and support fees consist of license fees for the initial and continued use and support of our licensed products 
services and other revenues consist of fees for consulting  application development and training services performed by us as well as miscellaneous other operational revenues 
we sell our products principally through our direct sales force domestically  and internationally through distributors and vars 
revenues from export sales and sales through our foreign subsidiary were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and an increase of from to revenue from export sales were  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase from to was the result of higher revenues in europe and canada  offset by lower revenues in brazil 
the decrease from to was the result of lower initial license fees in all regions 
we have entered into distributorship agreements with various xerox foreign affiliates to remarket our products internationally 
our revenues from these agreements were million  million and million 
table of contents in  and  respectively 
the decrease from to was the result of lower revenues in brazil 
the decrease from to was the result of lower initial license fees in all regions 
initial license fees 
initial license fees were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and an increase of from to the increase in was due to higher sales in the united states  canada and europe  as well as the release of our new product  xpression 
additionally  initial license fees have benefited from several contracts where customers extended their relationship with us following the expiration of their three year contracts 
such contract extensions totaled million 
because we have de emphasized three year term agreements  it is expected that the revenue from such extensions will decline significantly in the decrease in was largely the result of fewer sales and fewer new customers from our foreign resellers 
the components of initial license fees consist of the following years ended december  products compuset document library services document viewing services xpression total initial license fees annual renewal license and support fees 
annual renewal license fees were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to the increase in was due to increases in our base of licensed software and in our list prices 
the increase in was due to an increase in our installed base of users offset by the impact of discontinuing support for certain products and platforms 
services and other 
revenues from services and other were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing an increase of from to and a decrease of from to the decrease in was largely due to customer delays in initiating contracted projects  as well as the mix of software being licensed that requires fewer services 
the increase in was due to the delivery of consulting services needed to implement new product sales made during the fourth quarter of as well as significant follow on services to existing customers 
cost of revenues and operating expenses cost of initial license fees 
costs of initial license fees were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of initial license fees in  and  respectively 
cost of initial license fees includes amortization of previously capitalized software development costs  costs of third party software  employment costs for distribution personnel and product packaging 
the increase in compared to was primarily the result of higher sales and an increase in the amortization of software 
the decrease in compared to was due to lower sales and a decrease in the amortization of software 
cost of annual renewal license and support fees 
costs of annual license fees were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of annual license fees in  and  respectively 
costs of annual renewal license fees consist principally of the employment related costs for our technical support staff 
due to increased efficiencies  we were able to keep a steady headcount in compared to the increase in compared to was due to additional technical support personnel to support our increasing customer base 
cost of services and other 
costs of services and other were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of services and other revenue in 
table of contents and  respectively 
costs of services and other consist principally of the employment related costs of our consulting and training staff 
the decrease in compared to was primarily due to attrition and redeployment of personnel to other departments 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to additional personnel costs and the greater use of outside consultants to complete our increased consulting work in research and development 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to research and development expenses consist primarily of the employment related costs of personnel associated with developing new products  enhancing existing products  testing software products and developing product documentation 
we anticipate that we will continue to direct significant resources to the development and enhancement of our products 
in connection with a development services and referral agreement effective january   we have a two year  million agreement with objectiva to provide us development services in connection with our new product  xpression 
in  objectiva performed approximately of the services of this agreement and we paid them million 
we capitalized software development costs of million   and million in  and  respectively 
the increase between and was mainly due to development costs of our new product  xpression 
the decrease between and was due to timing of technological feasibility 
capitalized software development costs mainly include payroll related costs and consulting fees paid to objectiva in relation to the development of xpression 
the amount of software development costs to be capitalized in the future may change if the time between the establishment of technological feasibility of a product and its general release changes 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and an increase of from to selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  marketing programs and related costs for pre and post sales activity 
the increase in was primarily due to increased personnel costs  as well as higher trade show and travel costs 
the decrease in was primarily due to fewer personnel and decreased commissions due to decreased initial license fees 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing decreases of from to and from to general and administrative expenses consist of employment related costs for finance  administration and human resources  allowance for doubtful accounts and general corporate management expenses  including legal and audit fees 
these decreases were primarily due to decreased personnel and outside consultant costs 
other income expense 
other income expense is composed of interest income from cash and cash equivalents and short term investments offset by interest expense related to notes to xerox and losses on disposal of fixed assets 
other income was   and  in  and  respectively 
the decrease in was the result of less interest income due lower cash balances following the million debt payment in february and lower interest rates 
the decrease in was the result of less interest income following a large decrease in our cash balances as a result of our tender offer which was completed in april provision benefit for income taxes 
as a result of releasing a portion of our previously recorded valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets  we have recorded a  benefit for income taxes in the year ended december  we will continue to assess the likelihood of realization of our tax credits and other net deferred tax assets 
if future events occur that do not make the realization of such assets more likely than not  a valuation allowance will be established against all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets 
the provision for income taxes for and was for taxes under the alternative minimum tax 

table of contents factors that may affect future operating results our total revenues and operating results can vary  sometimes substantially  from quarter to quarter and are expected to vary significantly in the future 
our revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast 
future results will depend upon many factors  including the demand for our products  the level of product and price competition  the length of our sales cycle  the size and timing of individual license transactions  the delay or deferral of customer implementations  the budget cycles of our customers  our success in expanding our direct sales force and indirect distribution channels  the timing of new product introductions and product enhancements by us and our competitors  the mix of products and services sold  levels of international sales  activities of and acquisitions by competitors  the timing of new hires  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  our ability to develop and market new products  controlling costs and general domestic and international economic conditions 
in addition  our sales generally reflect a relatively high amount of revenue per order  and  therefore  the loss or delay of individual orders could have a significant impact on our revenues and quarterly operating results 
in addition  a significant amount of our revenues occur predominantly in the third month of each fiscal quarter and tend to be concentrated in the latter half of that third month 
our software products generally are shipped as orders are received 
as a result  initial license fees in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
the timing of receipt of initial license fees is difficult to predict because of the length of our sales cycle  typically three to twelve months from the initial contact 
because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue trends and because a high percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in the recognition of revenue from a limited number of initial license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in losses 
to the extent such expenses precede  or are not subsequently followed by  increased revenues  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
due to the foregoing factors  revenues and operating results for any quarter are subject to significant variation  and we believe that period to period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
this is a decrease of million from december  in february  we paid million to xerox to retire debt pursuant to our tender offer 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due largely to a favorable change in operating assets and liabilities 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  related primarily to the capitalization of computer software costs and net purchases of short term investments 
cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  related primarily to proceeds received from our sale of short term investments in preparation for payments made in april in connection with our tender offer in which we purchased  shares of our common stock for million 
net cash used in financing activities decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  related primarily to the payment of notes to xerox pursuant to our tender offer 
cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  reflected the cash portion of our tender offer 
we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures at least through the next twelve months 
however  if there were a decrease in customer demand for our products  our availability of funds would be reduced 
a portion of our remaining cash could be used to acquire or invest in complementary 
table of contents businesses or products or obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
we are currently evaluating  in our ordinary course of business  potential investments such as businesses  products or technologies 
we have no material current understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisition in whole of other businesses  products or technologies 
as of december  and  we did not have any other relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of voluntarily transitioning to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require disclosure of the method used to account for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method on reported results in both annual and interim financial statements 
the disclosure provisions will be effective for us beginning with our year ended december  we have not yet completed the final evaluation of the options presented by sfas no 
however  within this fiscal year  we expect to reach a determination of whether and  if so  when to change our existing accounting for stock based compensation to the fair value method in accordance with the transition alternatives of sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between sfas no 
and issue relates to sfas no 
s requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost as generally defined in issue was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
we will adopt sfas no 
effective january  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to a certain extent  foreign currency exchange rate movements also affect our competitive position  as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and or pricing strategies on non us based competitors 
the primary foreign currency risk exposure is related to us dollar to euro conversions 
considering the anticipated cash flows from firm sales commitments and anticipated sales for the next quarter  a hypothetical weakening of the us dollar relative to all other currencies would not materially adversely affect expected first quarter earnings or cash flows 
this analysis is dependent on actual export sales during the next quarter occurring within of budgeted forecasts 
the effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the affect this movement may have on other variables including competitive risk 
if it were possible to quantify this competitive impact  the results could well be different than the sensitivity effects described above 
in addition  it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar 
in reality  some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen 
each month  we review our position for expected currency exchange rate movements 

table of contents interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our short term available for sale investments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at december  declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income
