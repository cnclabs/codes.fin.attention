outside of our industrial developments  we also lease to various tenants land that is used for a full service truck stop facility  a truck wash  four auto service stations with convenience stores  four full service restaurants  five fast food operations  a motel  two antique shops  and a united states postal service facility 
we are also involved in a joint venture that owns and operates a acre travel and truck stop facility  named petro travel plaza  which is in tejon industrial complex west 
in addition  
table of contents several microwave repeater locations  radio and cellular transmitter sites  and fiber optic cable routes are also leased 
during july  a subsidiary of calpine corp 
executed an agreement with us for the development of a power plant on acres of land  construction of which is currently underway 
during the construction of the plant  we receive  per month for a month period that began in july commencing when the plant becomes operational  or earlier under certain circumstances  the annual amount increases to  per year  and is subject to escalation based upon changes in a designated consumer price index 
we are also entitled to receive additional payments after commercial operation of the plant begins  based upon production capacity at the plant and energy prices 
the term of the agreement is years from the date the plant becomes operational or earlier under certain circumstances  and calpine has three five year options to extend the term 
at this time  we do not expect the power plant to be operational until late or early we lease certain portions of our land to oil companies for the exploration and production of oil and gas  but do not ourselves engage in any such exploratory or extractive activities 
as of december   approximately  acres were committed to producing oil and gas leases from which the operators produced and sold approximately  barrels of oil and  mcf of dry gas during our share of production based upon prevailing average royalty rates during the last three years has been   and barrels of oil per day for   and  respectively 
approximately producing oil wells were located on the leased land as of december  estimates of oil and gas reserves on our properties are unknown to us 
we do not make such estimates  and our lessees do not make information concerning reserves available to us 
we have approximately  acres under lease to national cement company of california  inc  which we call national  for the purpose of manufacturing portland cement from limestone deposits found on the leased acreage 
national owns and operates on the property a cement manufacturing plant having capacity of approximately  tons of cement per year 
the amount of payment that we receive under the lease is based upon shipments from the cement plant 
the term of this lease expires in  but national has options to extend the term for successive periods of and years 
proceedings under environmental laws relating to the cement plant are in process  see item  legal proceedings 
our resort residential development activities include conceptual design planning and entitlement activities related to our lands 
during the third quarter of  we announced that our agreement with pardee homes  lewis investment company  and standard pacific corp 
was amended to reflect a larger master planned community development centennial 
the original agreement  previously announced in march  called for a  acre housing development 
the agreement has been amended to accommodate a master planned community that encompasses  acres 
the initial plans for this development were filed in los angeles county on august  we are estimating that it could take several years in order to receive approvals from los angeles county to begin development within this project 
upon completion of the development it is estimated that the community will include approximately  homes 
the community will also incorporate business districts  schools  retail and entertainment centers  medical facilities and other commercial office and light industrial businesses that  when completed  would create a substantial number of jobs 

table of contents in addition to the centennial community project  we are engaged in the constraints and feasibility analysis and phase i planning of a master planned mountain community 
we envision that the major components of any project would include mountain homes  a high quality golf and spa resort  a recreational emphasis  a small commercial component and substantial open space 
we call this concept tejon mountain village 
although the size of this development concept has not been finalized  it could involve several thousand acres 
while we have not defined the kind of real estate interests to be offered  they could include sites for homes in a rural  mountain environment 
the sale and leasing of commercial industrial and residential real estate is very competitive  with competition coming from numerous and varied sources around california 
the degree of competition is impacted by such factors as the supply of real estate available for sale or lease that is comparable to our property and the level of demand 
currently  our greatest competition for commercial industrial land comes from the inland empire region of southern california and areas north of us in the san joaquin valley of california 
the greatest competition for the centennial project will come from southern california 
farming operations in the san joaquin valley  we farm permanent crops including the following acreage wine grapes  almonds  pistachios and walnuts included in these acreage figures are acres of almonds to be developed during we also grow wheat on approximately acres and alfalfa on acres 
we sell our farm commodities to several commercial buyers 
as a producer of these commodities  we are in direct competition with other producers within the united states and throughout the world 
prices received by us for our commodities are determined by total industry production and demand levels 
we attempt to improve price margins by producing high quality crops through cultural practices and by obtaining better prices through marketing arrangements with handlers 
in  we purchased an almond processing plant for  in order to control the marketing of our almond production and lower hulling shelling and processing costs 
this facility was originally built in the s 
in  our almonds were primarily sold to various commercial buyers  with one of the buyers receiving approximately of the crop 
since we now process our own almonds  we have considerably more flexibility over the timing and nature of our sales 
we do not believe that we would be adversely affected by the loss of our largest buyers because of the size of the almond market  the large number of other buyers that would be available to us and the fact that the prices for these commodities do not vary based on the identity of the buyer 
in  the majority of our pistachios were sold to one customer  and our walnuts were sold to two customers  each purchasing approximately of the crop 
we believe that the loss of any of these customers would not adversely impact us because  like almonds  there are a number of potential purchasers of pistachios and walnuts  and prices do not change based on the identity of the buyer 
during  the majority of harvested wine grapes were sold to two wineries 
we continue to believe that there is an imbalance between the supply and demand of wine grapes as a result of so many new plantings coming into production within california 
during early march  we contracted all of our 
table of contents wine grape production 
at that time  we also contracted our french colombard grape production for and nut and grape crop markets are particularly sensitive to the size of each year s world crop and the demand for those crops 
large crops in california and abroad can rapidly depress prices 
our water entitlement for available from the state water project was adequate for our farming needs 
the state department of water resources has announced its water supply at of full entitlement 
other water supplies that the local water district will be able to make available to its farmers  combined with this level of state entitlement  are expected to provide a level of water supply that will cover all of our farming needs 
if in any year the local water district cannot meet all of our agricultural demands  we will rely on ground water sources  water transfers from the tejon castac water district and water banking arrangements that we have entered into 
water from these sources may be more expensive because of pumping costs and transfer costs  but can be expected to make up for shortfalls of the kind we have experienced in the past

item properties our  acres include portions of the san joaquin valley  portions of the tehachapi mountains and portions of the western end of the antelope valley 
a number of key transportation and utility facilities cross our land  including interstate  california highways  and  the california aqueduct which brings water from northern california  and various transmission lines for electricity  oil  natural gas and communication systems 
approximately  acres of our land are located in kern county  california 
the kern county general plan for this land contemplates continued commercial  resource utilization  farming  grazing and other agricultural uses  as well as certain new developments and uses  including residential and recreational facilities 
while the county general plan is intended to provide general guidelines for land use and development  it is subject to amendment to accommodate changing circumstances and needs 
in addition to conforming to the general plan  much of our land will require specific zoning and site plan approvals prior to actual development 
the remainder of our land  approximately  acres  is in los angeles county 
this area is accessible from interstate via highway los angeles county has adopted general plan policies which contemplate future residential development of portions of this land  subject to further assessments of environmental and infrastructure constraints 
we are currently pursuing entitlements for a master planned community on  acres of this land 
see item  business real estate operations 
portions of our land consist of mountainous terrain  and much of the land is not presently served by developed roads or by utility or water lines 
any significant development of the land would involve the construction of roads  utilities and other expensive infrastructure and would have to be done in a manner which accommodates a number of environmental concerns  including endangered species and wetlands issues  that may limit development of portions of the land or result in substantial delays in getting governmental approval 

table of contents water rights existing long term water contracts with the wheeler ridge maricopa water storage district  which we call the wheeler ridge water district  provide for water entitlements and deliveries from the california state water project to our agricultural operations in the san joaquin valley 
the term of these contracts extend to under the contracts we are entitled to annual water for  acres of land  which is adequate for our present farming operations 
in addition to our agricultural contract water entitlements  we have an additional entitlement to obtain from the california state water project sufficient water to service a substantial amount of future residential and or commercial development in kern county 
the tejon castac water district  a local water district serving only our land and land we have sold in the tejon industrial complex  has  acre feet of state water project entitlement  or enough to supply over  average families assuming delivery 
in addition  tejon castac has over  acre feet of water stored in kern county water banks 
both the entitlement and the banked water are the subject of a long term water supply contract extending to between tejon castac and our company 
tejon castac is the principal water supplier to the tejon industrial complex  and would be the principal water supplier for any significant residential and recreational development in tejon mountain village 
the years through were excellent water years with of our water entitlement being available from the state water project in each of  and in while in the years and project allocations were only and  respectively  the wheeler ridge water district was able to supply us with of our farming demands 
in some of these years  there was also sufficient runoff from local mountain streams to allow us to capture some of this water in reservoirs and utilize it to offset some of the higher priced state water project water 
both the wheeler ridge water district and tejon castac are able to bank percolate into underground aquifers some of their excess supplies for future use 
the wheeler ridge water district expects to be able to deliver our entire contract water entitlement in any year that the state water project deliveries exceed by drawing on its ground water wells and water banking assets 
based on historical records of water availability  we do not believe we have material problems with our water supply 
however  if state water project deliveries are less than of our entitlement in any year  or if less severe shortages continue for a sustained period of several years  then the wheeler ridge water district may not be able to deliver of our entitlement and we will have to rely on our own ground water sources  mountain stream runoff  water transfers from the tejon castac water district and water banking assets to supply the shortfalls to our farming operations 
water from these sources may be more expensive because of pumping costs and or transfer costs 
also  as we develop our real estate for residential  commercial and industrial uses  there will be less water available for agriculture from the tejon castac water district 
a allocation has been made by the state water project for with this allocation  along with the wheeler ridge water district s additional supplies  we believe that we will have adequate water supplies for farming in the water contracts with the wheeler ridge water district and with tejon castac require annual payments related to the fixed costs of the california state water project and each district  whether or not water is used or available 
the contracts also establish a lien on benefited land 

table of contents the water agency serving the los angeles county portion of our land  the antelope valley east kern water agency  has significant surplus entitlement and  although no assurance has been given  it has indicated that it would be able to provide a significant portion of the water needed for centennial 
portions of our property also have available groundwater 
that source would be sufficient to supply significant commercial development in the interstate corridor and provide a significant portion of the water needed for development at centennial and tejon mountain village 
historic state water project restrictions on the right to use agricultural water entitlement for municipal purposes were removed in  and the parties to a lawsuit challenging such removal have agreed to a settlement which would allow such removal to continue while the environmental impacts are studied 
for this purpose municipal use includes residential and industrial use 
therefore  although only  of tejon castac s  acre feet of entitlement are labeled for municipal use  there is no practical restriction on tejon castac s ability to deliver the remaining water to residential or industrial developments 
however  for political and regulatory reasons  it is unlikely that we would be able to direct any of our wheeler ridge water district agricultural entitlement to municipal or industrial uses 
item legal proceedings we lease land to national cement company of california  inc national for the purpose of manufacturing portland cement from limestone deposits found on the leased acreage 
see item  business real estate operations 
in february  national s former subtenant  systech environmental corporation systech  submitted to the california department of toxic substances control dtsc its final closure report for its former facility that burned hazardous waste as a supplemental fuel in the cement plant located on land leased from us 
systech s removal of certain contaminated soils is described in the final closure report 
we are advised that systech expects dtsc approval of its final closure report substantially in the form submitted 
in september  the california regional water quality control board rwqcb for the lahontan region issued a cleanup and abatement order with respect to an underground plume of chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds on certain property we lease to national for cement plant and related purposes 
this order  as amended on september   directs lafarge corporation lafarge  the successor to the previous tenant  national and us to  among other things  investigate the source and extent of the contamination and initiate cleanup 
we were ordered to complete the required investigation and cleanup only if lafarge and national fail to do so 
we are advised that lafarge and national have completed their investigation  and have installed a groundwater pump and treat system to clean up the groundwater 
in and  lafarge and national removed certain soils  which were the principal source of the contamination  from the property 
in may  the rwqcb issued waste discharge requirements requiring national  lafarge and us to consolidate  close and cap cement kiln dust piles located on land leased from us  and maintain and monitor the effectiveness of the cap 
we were ordered to undertake these activities only if national and lafarge fail to do so 
we are advised that national and lafarge have consolidated  closed and capped the cement kiln dust piles 
maintenance of the cap and groundwater monitoring remain as on going activities 

table of contents in october  the rwqcb issued a cleanup and abatement order with respect to an industrial waste landfill on the property 
this order  as amended on september   requires lafarge and us to complete the cleanup of groundwater associated with the landfill 
we were ordered to undertake these activities only if lafarge fails to do so 
we are advised that the rwqcb has approved lafarge s remedial plan recommending that the low level groundwater contamination at the landfill be addressed by natural attenuation 
groundwater monitoring remains as an ongoing activity 
lafarge previously removed waste historically disposed of in the landfill and transported that waste off site for disposal 
on september   the rwqcb ordered lafarge  national and us to investigate the extent of contamination resulting from a diesel fuel tank and pipeline and initiate cleanup activities 
we were ordered to undertake these activities only if lafarge and national fail to do so 
we are advised that lafarge and national have completed their investigation and installed an air sparging system to clean up the soil and ground water 
operation of the air sparging system remains as an on going activity 
to date  we are not aware of any failure by lafarge or national to comply with the orders of the rwqcb or to pursue the cleanup and investigation actions as informally instructed by rwqcb staff 
we have not been directed by the rwqcb to perform any of the investigative  characterization  remediation or removal activities 
under the lease between national and us  the tenant is obligated to indemnify us for costs and liabilities arising directly or indirectly out of the use of the leased premises by the tenant 
all obligations under this indemnity provision arising after the assignment of the lease to national which occurred in november were assumed by national  and lafarge has liability for all obligations under the indemnity provisions arising before the assignment 
national s obligation is guaranteed by its parent  national cement company  inc we believe that all of the matters described above in this item are included within the scope of the national or lafarge indemnity obligations 
the company believes that lafarge and national have sufficient resources to perform any reasonably possible or reasonably likely obligations relating to these matters 
therefore  we believe that it is unlikely that any cleanup orders issued by the rwqcb will have a material effect on us 
if  however  national and lafarge do not fulfill their cleanup responsibilities and we are required at our own cost to perform the remedial work likely to be mandated by the regulatory agencies on the sites described above  the amount of any such expenditure by us could be material 
on february   the center for biological diversity and other anti growth environmental groups filed a lawsuit in kern county superior court against kern county in which a subsidiary of the company is the real party in interest 
this suit challenges the county s certification of the environmental impact report for tejon industrial complex east tic east  the company s acre expansion of the industrial park at the south end of the san joaquin valley 
principal environmental issues raised in the suit involve the project s likely effects on air quality and endangered species  the impact of converting farmland to development and the related potential for growth inducement  and the cumulative impact of the project when combined with other development on the ranch and elsewhere 
the suit also challenges the land use entitlements granted by the county as being inconsistent with the county s general plan and zoning policies 

table of contents the company has an obligation to indemnify and defend the county and has undertaken defense of this suit in close coordination with county counsel 
the company believes that the lawsuit is without merit  and intends to defend it vigorously 
the suit does not ask for damages  but if plaintiffs prevail  the company would be called upon to pay their attorneys fees 
the biggest impact of the suit is to raise questions as to the practicality of developing tic east while the suit is pending 
while a delay in the company s ability to develop tic east could restrict its opportunities to serve industrial customers  the company has inventory of land remaining at the approved industrial development across the freeway 
this opportunity cost would be partially offset by postponing incurring capital expenditures for tic east infrastructure 
the suit is expected to be heard by the trial court judge this summer  with a decision rendered shortly thereafter 
appeals to california s intermediate appeals court and the california supreme court could extend the effects of the suit after a decision is rendered by the trial court 
if plaintiffs prevail  which the company considers unlikely  further delays would be incurred while the environmental impact report is revised to correct any deficiencies determined to exist  re approved by the county and possibly re litigated by the plaintiffs

part of this effort includes evaluating our land and water resources and planning our real estate development activities based upon the evaluation

critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  capitalization of costs  profit recognition related to land sales  and the operations of joint ventures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s revenue is primarily derived from rental revenue from our rental portfolio  royalty revenue from mineral leases  sales of farm crops  and land sales 
rental and royalty revenue is recognized when due from tenants 
revenue from leases with rent concessions or fixed escalations is recognized on a straight line basis over the initial term of the related lease 
the financial terms of leases are contractually defined 
rental revenue is not accrued when a tenant vacates the premises and ceases to make rent payments or files for bankruptcy 
revenues related to our agreements with calpine are recognized when earned due to the long time frame for construction and the uncertainty related to the timing of completion and beginning of plant operations 
at the time farm crops are harvested  contracted  and delivered to buyers and revenues can be estimated  revenues and any related inventory costs are recognized  which traditionally occurs during the third and fourth quarters of each year 
orchard almonds  pistachios  and walnuts revenues are based upon the contract settlement price or estimated selling price  whereas vineyard revenues are recognized at the contracted selling price 
estimated prices for orchard crops are based upon the quoted estimate of what the final market price will be by marketers and handlers of the orchard crops 
this method of recognizing revenues on the sale of orchard crops is a standard practice within the agribusiness community 

table of contents for the orchard crops we estimated almond revenues to be  or per pound on average  pistachio revenue to be  or per pound  and walnut revenue to be  or 
per pound 
these estimates not only impact the recorded revenues within our farming segment but also our recorded accounts receivable at december  over the last three years prices received on almonds have ranged from 
to per pound 
pistachio prices over the last three years have ranged from to per pound  and walnut prices have ranged from 
to 
per pound 
if we were to assume that our above estimates for orchard crop revenues were changed to the upper end or lower end of the range we developed in the course of formulating our estimate  orchard crop revenues would have been reduced or increased by approximately  or of the total revenue estimate 
our final estimates were based on the midpoint of a range in which the upper and lower ends of the range were 
from the midpoint 
actual final orchard crop selling prices are not determined for several months following the close of our fiscal year due to supply and demand fluctuations within the orchard crop markets 
adjustments for differences between original estimates and actual revenues received are recorded during the period in which such amounts become known 
the net effect of these adjustments increased farming revenue  in  and decreased farming revenue  in  and  in if we were to change our estimate of orchard crop revenues to the low end of the estimate range  there would be no material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
our estimate of orchard crop revenues is a critical accounting estimate for our farming segment 
management of the company has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
in recognizing revenue from land sales  the company follows the provisions in financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for sales of real estate sfas  to record these sales 
sfas provides specific sales recognition criteria to determine when land sales revenue can be recorded 
for example  sfas requires a land sale must be consummated with a sufficient down payment of at least to of the sales price depending upon the type and timeframe for development of the property sold  and that any receivable from the sale cannot be subject to future subordination 
in addition  the seller cannot retain any material continuing involvement in the property sold 
capitalization of cost the company capitalizes direct construction and development costs  including predevelopment costs  interest  property taxes  insurance  and indirect project costs that are associated with the acquisition  development  or construction of a project 
costs currently capitalized that in the future would be related to any abandoned development opportunities will be written off if we determine such costs do not provide any future benefits 
should development activity decrease  a portion of interest  property taxes  and insurance costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization  and would be expensed as incurred 
allocation of costs related to land salesand leases when we sell land within one of our real estate developments and we have not completed all infrastructure development related to the total project  we 
table of contents follow sfas and fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects  to determine the appropriate costs of sales for the sold land and the timing of recognition of the sale 
in the calculation of cost of sales or allocations to leased land we use estimates and forecasts to determine total costs at completion of the development project 
these estimates of final development costs can change as conditions in the market change and costs of construction change 
in preparing these estimates we use internal budgets  forecasts  and engineering reports to help us estimate future costs related to infrastructure that has not been completed 
these estimates become more accurate as the development proceeds forward due to historical cost numbers and to the continued refinement of the development plan 
these estimates are updated periodically throughout the year so that  at the ultimate completion of development  all costs have been allocated 
during  
per square foot of cost was allocated to sold and leased land as a cost of development 
any increases to this estimate in future years will negatively impact net profits and liquidity due to an increased need for funds to complete development 
if  however  this estimate decreases  net profits as well as liquidity will improve 
we believe that the estimates used related to cost of sales and allocations to leased land is a critical accounting estimate and will be more significant as we grow as a real estate development company because the estimates are very susceptible to change from period to period because they require management to make assumptions about costs of construction  absorption of product  and timing of completion of project  and changes to these estimates could have a material impact on the recognition of profits from the sale of land within our developments 
management has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to it in this md a 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our property and equipment and development projects for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
accounting standards require that if the sum of the future cash flow expected to result from a company s asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the reportedvalue of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized 
the amount of the impairment is determined by subtracting the fair value of the asset from the reported value of the asset 
we currently operate in two segments real estate and farming 
at this time there are no assets within our real estate or farming segments that we believe are in danger of being impaired due to market conditions 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because it is very susceptible to change from period to period  it requires management to make assumptions about future prices  production  and costs  and  the potential impact of a loss from impairment could be material to our earnings 
management s assumptions regarding future cash flows from real estate developments and farming operations have fluctuated in the past due to changes in prices  absorption  production and costs  and are expected to continue to do so in the future as market conditions change 
management has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to it in this md a

investment in joint ventures investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method 
under the equity method  the original investment is recorded at cost and is adjusted periodically to recognize our share of earnings or losses

table of contents fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  was issued in november the initial recognition and measurement requirements of the interpretation are effective on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of the required accounting treatment under the interpretation for guarantees issued or modified after december   which could require the recording of a guarantee liability equal to its estimated fair value based on the expected present value of the estimated probability weighted range of contingent payments under the guarantee arrangement 
we have not yet determined the anticipated impact of the application of the interpretation  however it could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position when it becomes effective for the financial year 
fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  was issued in january this interpretation addresses consolidation by business enterprises of joint ventures and special purpose entities described as variable interest entities in this interpretation that have certain characteristics 
the implementation of this interpretation could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements because we may have to begin to consolidate one or more of the joint ventures we have entered into 
we are currently reviewing all of our joint venture agreements to determine what the potential impact may be related to the implementation of this interpretation 
results of operations as reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  we had net income of  in  net income of  in  and a net loss of  in net income for declined when compared to due to lower real estate operating profits  reduced interest income  higher corporate expenses  and losses from discontinued operations 
these unfavorable variances were partially offset by improved profits from farming and equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures 
net income for improved when compared to due primarily to higher operating profits within the real estate division  increased interest income  and lower interest expenses 
these favorable variances were partially offset by losses from farming and higher corporate expenses 
net income for consists of income from continuing operations of  and a loss from discontinued operations of  net income for consisted of income from continuing operations of  and income from discontinued operations of  a significant portion of the income from discontinued operations resulted from the sale of assets of our cattle and feedlot operations 
real estate 
segment operating profits within real estate during were  a decrease of  when compared to segment profits 
the decline in segment profits during was due primarily to an increase in segment expenses and reduced revenues associated with the power plant lease 
revenues from the power plant agreement declined approximately  during due to the earning of milestone payments in related to easements and use of our land 
expenses increased due to the continued expansion of our real estate activities 
marketing and transaction costs related to our development projects increased  during property management costs  which included costs related to leased property and expenses associated with the management of the 
table of contents ranch  had a net increase of  during staff costs increased  during due to the timing of hiring staff during  and insurance costs allocated to real estate increased  due to a hardening of general liability and property insurance markets over the last two years 
these unfavorable variances were partially offset by increases in lease revenues  oil and mineral royalties  easement sales  and land sales 
lease revenues increased  due to three new leases coming on line during and to a full year of grazing lease revenue 
oil and mineral royalties grew  when compared to due to higher oil prices and increased production related to the cement plant lease 
during  we also received a  easement payment related to a natural gas pipeline that crosses our land and we sold approximately acres of land recognizing a gain of approximately  equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures increased  during due primarily to continued improvements in operations at petro travel plaza 
results of operations at the petro travel plaza joint venture increased  compared to the prior year due to an increase in volume of activity and improved margins on gasoline and diesel sales 
cash flows continued to improve during and expectations are for continued growth in the future as the tejon industrial complex continues to grow and as more travelers and trucking professionals place petro on their refueling schedules 
these joint venture profits were partially offset by a loss of  within the dermody tejon joint venture 
this loss was the result of depreciation and interest expense for the entire development  and costs early in associated with leasing one half of the building within the venture being greater than the revenue generated from leasing one half of the building 
near term activities within the real estate segment will be focused on the development of commercial industrial products  the receipt of entitlements for the centennial project in los angeles county  and completion of constraints and feasibility analysis and planning related to the tejon mountain village concept 
in the marketing of tejon industrial complex  we have seen signs that leasing activity has begun to slow down and that lease prices have been gradually declining within industrial developments in the los angeles area 
we have  however  seen a continuing interest in our industrial product due to the size of buildings that can be built within our development 
our development fits very well within the new logistics model that companies are beginning to use that favors larger single site buildings rather than a number of decentralized smaller distribution centers 
buildings of million square feet or larger are difficult to build in los angeles due to the number of acres necessary for a building of that size 
we feel that in the future our ability to provide land parcels to support buildings of that size will provide us with a potential marketing advantage 
the real estate segment will continue to see increases in costs  net of amounts capitalized  primarily related to professional service fees  marketing costs  commissions  planning costs  and staffing costs as we continue to increase real estate activities and pursue development opportunities 
during we are also anticipating a decline in revenues from the power plant agreement due to the timing of the plant becoming operational 
the power plant agreement allows for a twelve month grace period beginning july  per month in the event construction is not completed and the plant is not operational 
whether or not the plant is operational  contractual payments are scheduled to resume in july the actual timing and completion of entitlement and development related activities is difficult to predict due to the uncertainties of the approval process and market factors 
these types of real estate development activities and costs could continue over several years as we develop our land holdings 

table of contents we will also continue to evaluate land resources to determine the highest and best uses for our land holdings 
future sales of land are dependent on market circumstances and specific opportunities 
our goal in the future is to increase land value and create future revenue growth through planning and development of commercial  industrial  resort and residential programs 
real estate segment operating profits of  in were  or higher than segment profits 
the improvement in segment profits is due to a slight increase in revenues and to lower expenses 
the slight improvement in revenues was due to an increase in oil and mineral income of  increased lease income from our portfolio of properties of  and additional milestone payments for use of land  easements  and services provided related to the calpine power plant project of  these gains in real estate revenue were partially offset by the sale of land for  and the settlement of an easement payment for  during expenses declined  in due to no cost of sales and commissions associated with the sale of land when compared to the prior year and to lower indirect real estate project expenses 
these improvements were partially offset by higher staffing costs and marketing costs during the increased equity in earnings from our investment in petro travel plaza of  for was due to a continued increase in customers  improved margins on diesel and gasoline sales as our cost of sales declined throughout the year  and improved cost controls 
see part i  item business real estate operations for a further discussion of real estate development activities 
farming 
farming segment profits of  in increased  when compared to a loss of  in the improvement in segment profits is due to an increase in almond revenues of  higher pistachio revenues of  improved walnut revenues of  and an increase in revenues of  at our almond processing plant 
these increases in revenues were partially offset by increased cultural costs  and by higher operating costs at pacific almond  our almond processing plant 
cultural costs increased  due to higher harvesting costs and pest control costs 
net operating costs at pacific almond grew  due primarily to additional staffing and supplies cost related to an increase in the number of almonds processed at the plant 
partially offsetting these increases in cost was a reduction in fixed water costs of  almond revenues increased during due primarily to higher production when compared to the prior year 
the increase in production was due to excellent weather during the bloom period for almonds and to acres of almonds producing their first full crop 
almond prices for were also slightly higher than the prior year due to stronger demand for the product 
included within the increase in almond revenues is approximately  of earnings related to the receipt of crop insurance proceeds related to the crop 
pistachio revenues are higher in due to a continuing improvement in production and to improved prices when compared to production increased due to excellent weather during the growing season and to production being higher than expected from our young pistachio orchard 
pistachios are generally an alternate bearing crop  this means that a year of low production follows a year of high production 
since was a large pistachio crop  we expect to have lower production 
the improvement in walnut revenues is due to improved production  better pricing  and the receipt of  of crop insurance proceeds related to the crop 

table of contents industry expectations are that statewide almond and pistachio crop yields on average should continue to improve  which may negatively impact prices if demand for those products fails to keep pace with production 
we continue to expect pricing pressure on our almonds and pistachios over the next few years due to new statewide plantings beginning to produce higher volumes of these crops 
this increase in production may be somewhat negated by old almond orchards being removed as they become uneconomical to farm 
the potential increase in almond production will positively impact our almond processing operation because of more almonds being available to process 
all of our crops are particularly sensitive to the size of each year s world crop 
large crops in california and abroad can rapidly depress prices 
during  on a statewide basis  both almonds and pistachios experienced record production levels 
even at high production levels  prices remained stable due to increasing demand for these crops 
wine grape revenues during were flat when compared to grape prices however continued to be depressed during  and we expect that these depressed prices will continue throughout the growth in grape production within california is the primary reason for the decline in wine grape prices 
improved prices will be realized only if demand continues to improve for wine and grape products or there is a significant reduction in the number of acres used for grape production within california 
during early march  we contracted our grape production 
at that time  we also contracted our french colombard grape production for and during  the farming division sustained a loss of  a decrease of  when compared to segment profits 
the decline during was due to a decrease in grape revenues of  lower almond revenues of  reduced rental revenues of  and increased fixed water costs of  these unfavorable variances were partially offset by increased pistachio revenues of  and walnut revenues increasing  grape revenues continued to decline during due to lower prices and to reduced production 
grape prices declined approximately when compared to prices 
grape production declined due primarily to the removal of acres of unprofitable cabernet sauvignon grapes 
the overall decline in grape prices was directly related to the growth in production throughout california 
almond revenues during declined due to a large drop in production 
the decline in production was due to storms that impacted the pollination period and to storm damage to trees 
the damaged trees were ultimately removed due to the damage sustained in the storms and to the age of the damaged trees 
pistachio revenues increased in due to production doubling when compared to production 
a large part of the increase in production was due to acres of young pistachio trees producing their first full crop 
the improvement in walnut revenues is due primarily to increased production 
for a further discussion of the farming operations  refer to part i  item i  business farming operations 
interest 
interest and investment income during fell approximately  due to fewer funds being invested and to lower interest rates on funds invested 
the decline in funds invested was 
table of contents due to the liquidation of debt in and to expenditures on property and equipment that reduced cash available for investment in interest and investment income for increased  to  when compared to interest income 
the receipt of funds associated with the rights offering  which was completed during january  primarily drove the increase 
the increase in income from additional funds invested was partially offset by lower interest rates during the year 
interest expense for was  of which  is included in discontinued operations  compared to interest expense of  in  of which  is included in discontinued operations 
interest expense declined due to lower average outstanding amounts on credit lines and to the capitalization of interest expense due to the growth of our real estate development activities 
interest incurred and paid in was  compared to  in  of which  and  were capitalized  respectively 
interest expense during was  of which  is included in discontinued operations  compared to interest expense of  in  of which  is included in discontinued operations 
the decrease in interest expense was due to liquidation of debt throughout the year 
debt declined due to the disposal of our livestock operations throughout the year and to using cash from the rights offering to reduce debt 
interest incurred and paid in was  compared to  in  of which  and  were capitalized  respectively 
interest capitalized increased during due to the growth in our real estate development activities 
corporate expenses 
corporate expenses during were  an increase of  when compared to corporate expenses 
the increase is due to higher staffing and benefit costs  increased professional service fees  higher community and charitable donations  and an increase in insurance costs 
corporate expenses in were  an increase of  when compared to corporate expenses 
the increase during is due to higher professional service fees related to accounting and legal costs  higher staffing costs related to deferred stock compensation costs and employee benefits  and to higher depreciation expense discontinued operations 
during april  we finalized a plan for the sale of our cattle and feedlot division 
since then  we have disposed of our cattle and feedlot operations to provide capital for real estate development activities and to reduce outstanding debt 
while the sale of livestock assets has provided working capital  it has also resulted in the loss of significant revenues even after taking into account the revenue stream from the grazing leases we entered into in connection with the sale of the breeding herd 
while the operations of the livestock division created significant revenues they also used large amounts of debt and working capital 
we believed that our working capital and debt facilities would be better allocated to potentially higher returning and value enhancing real estate development activities  which led to our decision to dispose of the livestock division assets 
during april  we completed the process of liquidating the remaining stocker cattle herd and livestock assets that were still owned at december  discontinued operations during generated a loss of  or 
per share diluted  compared to income from discontinued operations of  or 
per share diluted  for the decrease 
table of contents from the prior year is due to a decline in revenues as a result of fewer cattle sales in and losses on many of the cattle sold because of lower prices in early in addition  during we recognized no revenues from the feedlot that was sold in july or gains from the sale of the breeding herd that occurred in income from discontinued operations  net of applicable taxes  of  during was  less than the  of income from discontinued operations  net of taxes  in the decline in income is largely due to revenues from discontinued operations of  decreasing  when compared to the  of revenues for this reduction in revenues is primarily due to fewer cattle being sold when compared to and to lower prices on cattle during the fourth quarter of during  approximately  fewer head of cattle were sold 
this reduction in cattle sold is due to replacement cattle not being purchased throughout the year that possibly could have been sold because of the decision to dispose of our livestock and feedlot assets 
partially offsetting this decline in revenues was a corresponding decline in expense due to fewer cattle being sold and to cattle inventory numbers declining throughout the year 
inflation  risks  and related factors affecting forward looking information 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations or future prospects could be materially adversely affected 
our strategy  focused on more aggressive development of our land  involves risk and could result in operating losses 
cyclical industry 
the real estate development industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions  including employment levels availability of financing interest rates consumer confidence demand for the developed product  whether residential or industrial the process of development of a project begins  and financial and other resources are committed  long before a real estate project comes to market  which could occur at a time when the real estate market is depressed 
it is also possible in a rural area like ours that no market for the project will develop as projected 
interest rates 
higher interest rates generally impact the real estate industry by making it harder for buyers to qualify for financing  and that can lead to a decrease in the demand for residential  commercial or industrial sites 
any decrease in demand will negatively impact our proposed developments 
any downturn in the economy or consumer confidence can also be expected to result in reduced housing demand and slower industrial development  which would negatively impact the demand for land we are developing 
government and environmental regulations 
in planning and developing our land  we are subject to various local  state  and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning zoning  infrastructure design  and construction guidelines 
these requirements can possibly include restrictive zoning and density provisions that limit the number of homes that can be 
table of contents built within the boundaries of a particular area  which may impact the financial returns from a given project 
in addition  we are subject to statutes and regulations concerning the protection of the environment 
environmental laws that apply to a given site can vary greatly according to the site s location  condition  present and former uses of the site  and the presence or absence of sensitive elements like wetlands and endangered species 
environmental laws and conditions may result in delays and or cause us to incur additional costs for compliance  mitigation and processing land use applications 
in addition  many states  cities and counties have in the past approved various slow growth measures 
if that were to occur in our region  our future real estate development activities could be significantly adversely affected 
litigation 
the land use approval processes we must follow to ultimately develop our projects have become increasingly complex 
moreover  the statutes  regulations and ordinances governing the approval processes provide third parties the opportunity to challenge the proposed plans and approvals 
as a result  the prospect of third party challenges to planned real estate developments provides additional uncertainties in real estate development planning and entitlements 
third party challenges in the form of litigation would  by their nature  adversely affect the length of time required to obtain the necessary approvals 
in addition  adverse decisions arising from any litigation would increase the costs and could adversely affect the design  scope  plans and profitability of a project 
real estate inventory risk 
our three principal real estate projects  the tejon industrial complex  centennial and the tejon mountain village concept  all involve obtaining governmental entitlements and improving lots for sale to developers or  in the case of tejon industrial complex  end users 
the value of these lots can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing economic and market conditions 
competition 
within our real estate activities  we are in direct competition for customers with other industrial sites in northern  central  and southern california 
we are also in competition with other highway interchange locations using interstate and state route for commercial leasing opportunities 
geographic concentration 
all of our developable land is in california 
any adverse change in the economic climate of california  or our region of that state  could adversely affect our real estate development activities 
ultimately our ability to sell or lease lots may decline as a result of weak economic conditions 
financing 
our proposed new real estate development will require additional financing 
it is uncertain whether the required financing will be available  and if so  whether it will be available on favorable terms 
key personnel 
we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect our prospects 
we currently depend heavily on the services of robert a 
stine  our president and chief executive officer  and a number of other key management personnel 
the loss of mr 
stine s services or that of other key personnel could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  or our ability to pursue land development 
our success will also 
table of contents depend in part on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel 
competition for such personnel is strong in the real estate and land development industry and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining the personnel we require 
only a limited market exists for tejon ranch common stock which could lead to price volatility 
our common stock was designated for quotation on the new york stock exchange in july and trading volumes since that time have been modest 
the limited trading market for our common stock may cause fluctuations in the market value of our common stock to be exaggerated  leading to price volatility in excess of that which would occur in a more active trading market of our common stock 
concentrated ownership of our common stock creates a risk of sudden change in our share price 
as of march   directors and members of our executive management team beneficially owned or controlled approximately of our common stock 
investors who purchase our common stock may be subject to certain risks due to the concentrated ownership of our common stock 
the sale by any of our large shareholders of a significant portion of that shareholder s holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the registration of any significant amount of additional shares of our common stock will have the immediate effect of increasing the public float of our common stock and any such increase may cause the market price of our common stock to decline or fluctuate significantly 
inflation 
inflation can have a major impact on our farming operations 
the farming operations are most affected by escalating costs and unpredictable revenues due to an oversupply of certain crops and very high irrigation water costs 
high fixed water costs related to our farm lands will continue to adversely affect earnings 
prices received for many of our products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and commodity prices 
therefore  it is difficult for us to accurately predict revenue  just as we cannot pass on cost increases caused by general inflation  except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices 
within our real estate operations  our lease portfolio is protected to some extent from inflation since percentage rent clauses and consumer price index increases in our leases tend to adjust rental receipts for inflation 

table of contents other risks 
we may also encounter other difficulties in developing our land  including natural risks  such as geological and soils problems  earthquakes  heavy rains and flooding and heavy winds  shortages of qualified tradespeople  reliance on local contractors  who may be inadequately capitalized  shortages of materials  and increases in the cost of certain materials 
financial condition 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities totaled approximately  at december   an increase of  from the corresponding amount at the end of working capital at the end of was  which is  less than working capital at the end of cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities increased during due to the liquidation of the remaining discontinued assets  the receipt of bond reimbursement proceeds  and funds from the exercise of stock options 
these increases were partially offset by property and equipment expenditures  land development project costs  and the financing of receivables and inventories 
working capital decreased due to a decline in current assets 
the decrease in current assets is primarily related to the liquidation of the remaining assets of discontinued operations 
the funds from these assets were used throughout the year to fund operations and property and equipment expenditures 
during the principal uses of cash and cash equivalents consisted of capital expenditures related to real estate development activities  financing of receivables and inventories  and the reduction in both short term and long term debt 
we have a secured revolving line of credit of  that  as of december   had no outstanding balance 
this line of credit bears interest at a rate which floats with changes in the lending bank s prime interest rate 
at our option the interest rate on this line of credit can be fixed for a period of time at over a selected libor rate or float at 
less than the bank s prime lending rate 
during short term debt declined significantly due to the disposition of livestock assets and to the use of proceeds from the rights offering that was completed earlier in our outstanding long term debt  less current portion of  declined  to  at the end of when compared to long term debt is being used to fund real estate development infrastructure and farming assets on our land  commercial buildings in phoenix  arizona that were purchased in  and the almond processing plant purchased in january long term debt currently consists of three separate debt obligations 
one long term note for real estate and farming purposes provides for loan amounts up to  has a current balance of  and is secured by farmland 
this note comes due in the second note obligation was used to purchase the buildings in phoenix  is secured by mortgages on the buildings  and has a balance of  the last note is for a loan used to purchase the almond processing plant in and has a balance of  
table of contents the following table shows our long term obligations and commitments over the next five years payments due by period total one year or less years years after years contractual obligations long term debt total contractual obligations amount of commitment expiration per period total one year or less years years after years other commercial commitments standby letter of credit guarantees total other commercial commitments the standby letter of credit is related to the issuance of community facility district bonds by the tejon ranch public facilities financing authority  a joint powers authority created by kern county and the tejon castac water district 
the standby letter of credit is in place to provide additional credit enhancement and covers approximately two years worth of interest on the outstanding bonds 
this letter of credit will not be drawn upon unless we  as the largest landowner in the district  fail to make our property tax payments 
this letter of credit will terminate in the future as land in the district becomes developed 
the guarantees consist of a  guarantee related to the debt of petro travel plaza llc  an unconsolidated limited liability company in which we are equity owners with petro stopping centers  lp total debt in the venture is approximately  and is related to the long term financing of the facility 
this guarantee will be reduced over the next two years as the principal balance on the loan is reduced through scheduled debt payments 
the remaining  of guarantees relate to debt within the tejon dermody industrial llc  an unconsolidated joint venture to construct and market a  square foot building at the tejon industrial complex 
total debt in the venture is approximately  and was used in the construction of the building 
in the joint venture agreement each partner agreed to guarantee one half of the outstanding construction loan debt through the two year term of the loan 
it is anticipated that this loan will be refinanced during july during march  a lease was signed for one half of the building and the cash payments from this lease will cover principal and interest debt service requirements under the current loan agreement 
at this time we believe that neither of the guarantees nor the standby letter of credit will ever be called upon 

table of contents it is difficult to accurately predict cash flows due to the nature of our businesses and to fluctuating economic conditions 
our earnings and cash flows will be affected from period to period by the commodity nature of our farming operations and to the timing of sales and leases of property within our development projects 
the timing of sales and leases within our development projects is difficult to predict due to the time necessary to complete the development process and negotiate sales or lease contracts 
often  this nuance of land development can lead to particular years or periods having more or less earnings than comparable periods 
based on our experience  we believe we will have adequate cash flows and cash balances over the next twelve months to fund internal operations 
during   has been budgeted for capital expenditures and development investment  which includes nearly  for infrastructure at the tejon industrial complex west and east  and  for planning and analysis work related to potential real estate projects in the mountain lake area of our lands and los angeles county 
other items included in the capital expenditure budget are a acre almond development for  equipment  and improvements to existing facilities 
our current and future capital resource requirements will be provided primarily from the following sources current cash and marketable securities  cash flow from ongoing operations  proceeds from the sale of developed parcels  additional use of debt  and proceeds from the reimbursement of public infrastructure costs through community facilities district bond debt 
as noted above  we have  in cash and securities and  available on credit lines to meet any short term liquidity needs 
we continue to expect that substantial investments will need to be made in future years in our land assets to secure entitlements and develop the land 
in order to meet these long term capital requirements  we will need to secure additional debt financing and continue to renew our existing credit facilities 
in addition to debt financing  we will use other capital alternatives such as joint ventures with financial partners  sales of assets  and the issuance of common stock 
there is no assurance that we can obtain financing from any of these sources or that we can obtain financing at favorable terms 

table of contents item a 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial or commodity market prices or rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of interest rates and commodity prices 
financial market risks our exposure to financial market risks includes changes to interest rates and credit risks related to marketable securities  interest rates related to our outstanding indebtedness and trade receivables 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields and prudently managing risk 
to achieve this objective and limit interest rate exposure  we limit our investments to securities with a maturity of less than five years and an investment grade of a or better from moody s or standard and poors 
see note  marketable securities  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its short term working capital line of credit and the long term debt currently outstanding 
the short term line of credit interest rate can be tied to the lending bank s prime rate and would change when that rate changes  or the debt can be tied to a libor rate on a fixed basis and change only at maturity of the fixed rate feature 
a portion of the long term debt  has a fixed interest rate  and the fair value of this long term debt will change based on interest rate movements in the market 
the remaining long term debt  can either be fixed for periods of time to a libor rate or float with the lending bank s prime rate 
the floating rate obligations expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates 
if interest rates increase  interest expense increases 
conversely  if interest rates decrease  interest expense also decreases 
we believe it is prudent to limit the variability of a portion of our interest payments 
to meet this objective we entered into an interest rate swap to manage the potential fluctuations in cash flows resulting from interest rate risk 
see note  interest rate risk management  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
credit and market risks related to our inventories ultimately depend on the value of the almonds  grapes  pistachios  and walnuts at the time of payment or sale 
credit risk related to our receivables depends upon the financial condition of our customers 
based on historical experience with current customers and periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions  we believe our credit risk is minimal 
market risk is discussed below in commodity price exposure 
the following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the tables present the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates of our marketable securities  debt obligations and interest rate swaps 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity financial market risks principal amount by expected maturity at december  dollars in thousands fair value thereafter total assets marketable securities weighted average interest rate liabilities short term debt weighted average interest rate long term debt weighted average interest rate variable to fixed swap notional amount weighted average fixed rate contract rate  swap arrangement

our risk in regards to fluctuations in interest rates has remained constant over the last two years due to the reduction in the use of both short term and long term lines of credit that fluctuate with the bank s prime lending rate 
commodity price exposure we have exposure to adverse price fluctuations associated with certain inventories and accounts receivable 
inventories consist of farming and processing costs related to crop production 
the farming costs inventoried that are related to the crop are recorded at actual costs incurred 
historically  these costs have been recovered each year when that year s crop harvest has been sold 
with respect to accounts receivable  the amount at risk relates primarily to farm crops 
these receivables are recorded as estimates of the prices that ultimately will be received for the crops 
the final price is generally not known for several months following the close of our fiscal year 
of the accounts receivable outstanding at december    is at risk to changing prices 
of the amount at risk to changing prices   is attributable to almonds   to pistachios   to walnuts 
the comparable amounts of accounts receivable at december  were 
table of contents  related to almonds   related to pistachios  and  to walnuts 
the price estimated for recording accounts receivable at december  was per pound for almonds 
for every 
change in the price of almonds our receivable for almonds increases or decreases by  although the final price of almonds and therefore the extent of the risk is not presently known  over the last three years the final prices have ranged from 
to 
with respect to pistachios  the price estimated for recording the receivable was per pound  each 
change in the price increases or decreases the receivable by  and the range of final prices over the last three years for pistachios has been to the price estimated for recording accounts receivable for walnuts was 
per pound 
for every 
change in the price of walnuts  our receivable increases or decreases by  the final price for walnuts has averaged from 
to 
over the last three years
