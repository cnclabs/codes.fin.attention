financial condition liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed operations through a combination of cash on hand  cash provided from operations and available borrowings under bank lines of credit 
as of january   the company had  in cash  and as of january   the company had  in cash and cash equivalents 
during fiscal  the company used approximately  to fund capital improvements to existing and acquired restaurants 
cash provided by operations was approximately million for fiscal and approximately million for fiscal the company intends to modestly expand operations through the acquisition of regional buffet chains or through the purchase of existing restaurants which would be converted to one of the company s existing restaurant concepts 
in many instances  management believes that existing restaurant locations can be acquired and converted to the company s prototype at a lower cost 
management estimates the cost of acquiring and converting one leased property to one of the existing concepts to be approximately  to  these costs consist primarily of exterior and interior appearance modifications  new tables  chairs and food bars and the addition of certain kitchen and food service equipment  of which the company has some available from closed stores 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to acquire additional restaurant chains or locations or  if acquired  that these restaurants will have a positive contribution to the company s results of operations 
on october   the company entered into a million syndicated bank financing agreement led by fleetboston financial corporation formerly known as bankboston  na the credit facility consists of a million  year term loan the term loan facility and a million  year revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility 
the term loan facility refinanced existing indebtedness and provided capital for the repurchase of star buffet common stock and acquisitions 
principal payments under the term loan facility were due in quarterly installments beginning november and were scheduled to continue until the final maturity in october however  the company paid the term loan facility in full on may  borrowings under the revolving credit facility have been used for the company s new unit development and working capital needs 
all outstanding amounts under the revolving credit facility will become due in october the revolving credit facility balance was  on april  and  at january  the company has  in letters of credit against the revolving credit facility leaving  available for borrowing on april  negotiations are in process to replace the existing revolving credit facility 
alternatively  the company is also active in securing long term financing of real estate properties and or the disposition of excess properties to the extent the need for refinancing the revolving credit facilities would be mitigated if not entirely eliminated 
one property has already been sold in april for  the company believes that available cash  cash flow from operations and amounts available under the revolving credit facility or the replacement of the revolving credit facility  securing long term financing of real estate properties and or the disposition of excess properties will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital  and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
if the company requires additional funds to support its working capital requirements or for other purposes  it may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity and or debt financing or from other sources 
there can be no assurance  however  that changes in the company s operating plans  the unavailability of a credit facility  the acceleration of the company s expansion plans  lower than anticipated revenues  increased expenses or potential acquisitions of other events will not cause the company to seek additional financing sooner than anticipated 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
impact of inflation management recognizes that inflation has an impact on food  construction  labor and benefit costs  all of which can significantly affect the company s operations 
historically  the company has been able to pass any associated higher costs due to these inflationary factors along to its customers because those factors have impacted nearly all restaurant companies 
however  management has emphasized cost controls rather than price increases given the competitive pressure within the quick service restaurant industry 
critical accounting policies and judgments the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the application of certain accounting policies  the most significant of which are described in note summary of significant accounting policies 
certain of these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variations and may significantly affect the company s reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods 
changes in underlying factors  assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on the company s future financial condition and results of operations 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
property  buildings and equipment property and equipment and real property under capitalized leases are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight line method over the following useful lives years buildings building improvements furniture  fixtures and equipment leasehold improvements are amortized over the lessor of the life of the lease or estimated economic life of the assets 
the life of the lease includes renewal options determined by management at lease inception for which failure to renew options would result in a substantial economic penalty 
repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred 
remodeling costs are generally capitalized 
the company s accounting policies regarding buildings and equipment include certain management judgments regarding the estimated useful lives of such assets  the residual values to which the assets are depreciated and the determination as to what constitutes increasing the life of existing assets 
these judgments and estimates may produce materially different amounts of depreciation and amortization expense that would be reported if different assumptions were used 
as discussed further below  these judgments may also impact the company s need to recognize an impairment charge on the carrying amount of these assets as the cash flows associated with the assets are realized 
impairment of goodwill goodwill and other intangible assets primarily represent the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in connection with business acquisitions 
as of january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
in accordance with sfas  the company has ceased amortizing goodwill recorded in past business combinations effective as of january  as a result  there is no charge for goodwill amortization expense contained in the company s statements of operations for the year ended january   whereas the company s statements of operations for the years ended january  and january  do contain charges for goodwill amortization expense 
sfas required that goodwill initially be tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of goodwill on a reporting unit basis to the carrying amount of the goodwill as of january  the company performed the transitional impairment test and determined that the carrying amount of goodwill was in excess of the fair value of the company s net assets 
this has resulted in a transitional impairment loss of  which has been reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle net of a tax benefit of  reported in the first quarter of impairment of long lived assets the company determines that an impairment write down is necessary for locations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets 
judgments made by the company related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the ability of the company to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in economic conditions  and changes in operating performance 
as the company assesses the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of its long lived assets  these factors could cause the company to realize a material impairment charge

 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation addresses the consolidation of business enterprises variable interest entities to which the usual condition of consolidation does not apply 
this interpretation focuses on financial interests that indicate control 
it concludes that in the absence of clear control through voting interests  a company s exposure variable interest to the economic risks and potential rewards from the variable interest entity s assets and activities are the best evidence of control 
variable interests are rights and obligations that convey economic gains or losses from changes in the values of the variable interest entity s assets and liabilities 
variable interests may arise from financial instruments  service contracts  nonvoting ownership interests and other arrangements 
if an enterprise holds a majority of the variable interests of an entity  it would be considered the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary would be required to include assets  liabilities and the results of operations of the variable interest entity in its consolidated financial statements 
this interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities which are created after or for which control is obtained after january  for variable interest entities created prior to february   the provisions would be applied effective july  the company does not have any variable interest entities as of january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s principal exposure to financial market risks is the impact that interest rate changes could have on its million credit facility  of which  remained outstanding as of april  borrowings under the company s credit facility bear interest at the prime rate or at libor plus an applicable margin based on certain financial ratios averaging approximately in fiscal 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in short term interest rates would result in a reduction of approximately  in annual pre tax earnings 
the estimated reduction is based upon the outstanding balance of the company s credit facility and assumes no change in the volume  index or composition of debt at april  all of our business is transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  foreign exchange rate fluctuations have never had a significant impact on the company and are not expected to in the foreseeable future 
commodity price risk the company purchases certain products which are affected by commodity prices and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  market conditions and other factors which are not considered predictable or within our control 
although many of the products purchased are subject to changes in commodity prices  certain purchasing contracts or pricing arrangements contain risk management techniques designed to minimize price volatility 
typically the company uses these types of purchasing techniques to control costs as an alternative to directly managing financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
in many cases  the company believes it will be able to address commodity cost increases which are significant and appear to be long term in nature by adjusting its menu pricing  menu mix or changing our product delivery strategy 
however  increases in commodity prices could result in lower operating margins for our restaurant concepts
