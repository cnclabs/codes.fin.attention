the discussion in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form k should be read as applying to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in business risks below as well as those discussed elsewhere 
overview vitria was incorporated in california october and reincorporated in delaware in july we initially generated revenues exclusively through consulting contracts with third parties and government grants 
in june  we commercially released our first product and in september  we had an initial public offering of common stock 
we have incurred significant losses since inception  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we derive revenues primarily from two sources licenses  and services and other 
our products are typically licensed directly to customers for a perpetual term  with pricing based on the number of copies licensed  or systems or applications managed 
we record license revenues when a license agreement has been signed by both parties  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the fee is probable  and delivery of our product has occurred 
for electronic transmissions  we consider our product to have been delivered when the access code to download the software from the internet has been provided to the customer 
service and other revenues include product maintenance  consulting  training and government grants 
customers who license businessware normally purchase maintenance contracts 
these contracts provide unspecified software upgrades and technical support over a specified term  which is typically twelve months 
maintenance contracts are usually paid in advance  and revenues from these contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
a majority of our customers use third party system integrators to implement our products 
customers typically purchase additional consulting services from us to support their implementation activities 
these consulting services are generally sold on a time and materials basis and recognized as the services are performed 
we also offer training services which are sold on a per student or per class basis and recognized as the classes are attended 

table of contents we market our products through our direct sales force and augment our marketing efforts through relationships with system integrators and technology vendors 
our revenues to date have been derived primarily from accounts in the united states 
we have international sales offices in australia  brazil  canada  france  germany  italy  japan  korea  mexico  singapore  spain  taiwan and the united kingdom 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
we evaluate our estimates  on an on going basis  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  goodwill and purchased intangibles impairment assessments and restructuring charges 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from software licenses to end users for businessware and other products and related services  which include maintenance and support  consulting and training services 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended  we record revenue from software licenses when a license agreement is signed by both parties  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the fee is probable and delivery of the product has occurred 
for electronic delivery  the product is considered to have been delivered when the access code to download the software from the internet has been provided to the customer 
if an element of the agreement has not been delivered  revenue for the element is deferred based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for the undelivered element  all revenue is deferred until sufficient objective evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
we treat all arrangements with payment terms longer than normal not to be fixed or determinable 
our normal payment terms currently range from net days to net days for domestic and international customers  respectively 
revenue is deferred for those agreements which exceed our normal payment terms and are therefore assessed as not being fixed or determinable 
revenue under these agreements is recognized as payments become due unless collectibility concerns exist  in which case revenue is deferred until payments are received 
our assessment of collectibility is particularly critical in determining whether revenue should be recognized in the current market environment 
if collectibility is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
revenue on arrangements with customers who are not the ultimate users  primarily third party systems integrators  is not recognized until evidence of sell through arrangement to an end user has been received 
service and other revenues include product maintenance  consulting  and training 
customers who license businessware normally purchase maintenance contracts 
these contracts provide unspecified software upgrades and technical support over a specified term  which is typically twelve months 
maintenance contracts are usually paid in advance  and revenues from these contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
a majority of our customers use third party system integrators to implement our products 
customers typically purchase additional consulting services from us to support their implementation activities 
these consulting services are generally sold on a time and materials basis and recognized as the services are performed 
we also offer training services which are sold on a per student or per class basis and recognized as the classes are attended 

table of contents payments received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
when the software license arrangement requires us to provide consulting services for significant production  customization or modification of the software  or when the customer considers these services essential to the functionality of the software product  both the product license revenue and consulting services revenue are recognized in accordance with the provision of statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we recognize revenue from these arrangements using the percentage of completion method based on cost inputs and  therefore  both product license and consulting services revenue are recognized as work progresses 
these arrangements have not been common and  therefore  the significant majority of the company s license revenue in the past three years has been recognized under sop allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to deliver required payments to us 
these allowances are established through analysis of the credit worthiness of each customer  which is based on credit reports from third parties  analysis of published or publicly available financial information and customer specific experience including payment practices and history 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
when we believe a collectibility issue exists with respect to a specific receivable  we record an allowance to reduce that receivable to the amount that we believe is collectible 
goodwill and purchased intangibles impairment assessments in  we recorded impairment charges of million related to goodwill and million related to acquired intangible assets 
under current accounting standards  which changed significantly at the start of  we make judgments about the recoverability of goodwill and purchased intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
in order to estimate the fair value of these assets  we make various assumptions about the future prospects for the assets and typically estimate future cash flows to be generated 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
see note goodwill  note intangible assets and note recent accounting pronouncements  of the financial statements for more information about how we make these judgments 
restructuring charges during  we recorded million of restructuring charges related to the realignment of our business operations 
these charges represent expenses incurred in connection with certain cost reduction programs that we have undertaken  and consist primarily of the cost of involuntary termination benefits and remaining contractual lease payments and other costs associated with closed facilities  net of anticipated sublease income 
only costs resulting from a restructuring plan that are not associated with  or that do not benefit activities that will be continued  are eligible for recognition as liabilities at the commitment date 
the charges for facility closure costs require the extensive use of estimates  including estimates and assumptions related to future maintenance costs  our ability to secure sub tenants and anticipated sublease income to be received in the future 
if we fail to make accurate estimates or to complete planned activities in a timely manner  we might record additional charges or reverse previous charges in the future 
such additional charges or reversals will be recorded to the restructuring charges line in our statement of operations in the period in which additional information becomes available to indicate our estimates should be adjusted 

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following tables set forth statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters ended december   as well as the percentage of our total revenues represented by each item 
this information has been derived from our unaudited financial statements 
the unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements contained in this annual report and include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of this information 
you should read this information in conjunction with our annual audited financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
our quarterly operating results are expected to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and you should not draw any conclusions about our future results from the results of operations for any quarter

adjustments to prior period financial statements have not been made because the amounts have not been material 
revenues during  our revenues from customers outside the united states increased to from in in  revenues from customers outside the united states increased to from in in  we believe international revenues will decrease as a percentage of total revenues 
to date  we have not experienced significant seasonality of revenue 
we expect that future results may be affected by the fiscal or quarterly budget cycles of our customers 
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for of total revenues in  of total revenues in and of total revenues in in all three years  no single customer accounted for more than of total revenues 
as of december   bp oil international accounted for of our accounts receivable balance 
as of december   at t corporation and bell canada accounted for and  respectively  of our accounts receivable balance 
we expect that revenues from a limited number of customers will continue to account for a large percentage of total revenues in future quarters 
therefore  the loss or delay of individual orders could have a significant impact on revenues 
our ability to attract new customers will depend on a variety of factors  including the reliability  security  scalability and the overall cost effectiveness of our products 
license 
license revenues decreased from million in to million in license revenues decreased from million in to million in both of these decreases were due to fewer total orders and a decrease in our average deal size caused by the ongoing slowdown in information technology spending in our vertical markets 
during fiscal year  we expect license revenues to increase slightly from those in 
table of contents service and other 
service and other revenues increased from million in to million in service and other revenues increased from million in to million in these increases in service revenues were due to the growth of consulting revenues associated with license agreements signed in earlier periods 
although we have been adding new customers over the past two years  some customers have not renewed their maintenance agreements and thus support revenues have remained flat during both and during  we expect service and other revenues to decrease slightly from we expect consulting revenue to decline slightly and support revenue to remain flat in due the decrease in license revenue in  the relatively low new customer installations in and our expectation of only a slight increase in license revenue in included in deferred revenue as of december  is approximately million of unrecognized revenues from government grants which are subject to the resolution of outstanding audits with the government 
we expect some of these audits will be resolved in which may result in repaying some amount to the government and or recognition of certain deferred government grant revenues 
cost of revenues license 
cost of license revenues consists of royalty payments to third parties for technology incorporated into our product 
cost of license revenues increased from million in to million in this increase was due primarily to the write off during of a non cancelable royalty agreement that we determined will have no future utility to us 
cost of license revenues increased from  in to million in this increase was due to an increase in sales of those particular license products which incorporate third party technology 
we expect cost of license revenues to continue to fluctuate in the future as it is dependent upon the third party technology incorporated into our products and the buying patterns of our customers 
service and other 
cost of service and other revenues consists of salaries  facility costs  travel expenses and payments to third party consultants incurred in providing customer support  training and implementation services 
cost of service and other revenues increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to increased travel expenses of million incurred by our professional services group related to increased consulting revenues in the current year 
cost of service and other revenues increased from million in to million in this increase resulted from million in additional salary costs from hiring additional service personnel  including the addition of employees that resulted from the acquisition of xmlsolutions in  as well as increased facility costs of million associated with additional personnel 
we expect that the cost of service and other expenses will decrease slightly in due to the restructuring and cost savings efforts we undertook in operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  commissions  field office expenses  travel  entertainment and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to decreased salary expenses of million due to our workforce reductions in the current fiscal year  decreased commissions of million due to lower license revenue  decreased facilities costs of million and decreased travel expense of million 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily the result of increases in salary costs of million from hiring additional sales and marketing personnel  increased facilities costs of million as we expanded our domestic and international field offices  and increased travel expenses of million associated with our larger sales force as we expanded our operations  which was offset by a decrease in advertising expenses of million  a decrease in commission expense of million and a decrease in external recruiting expenditures of million 
in  we expect that sales and marketing expenses will be lower as compared to due to cost saving efforts initiated in 
table of contents research and development 
research and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new products  enhancements to existing products  and quality assurance activities 
these costs consist primarily of employee salaries  benefits  and the cost of consulting resources that supplement the internal development team 
research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to decreased salary expenses of million arising from our workforce reductions in  as well as related decreases in most other expense areas 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily the result of increased salary expenses of million related to additional personnel  including the addition of xmlsolutions employees  and increased facilities costs of million associated with the increase in personnel as we expanded our operations 
in  we anticipate that research and development expenses will decrease due to reduced headcount and other cost saving efforts initiated in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries for administrative  executive and finance personnel  information systems costs  outside professional service fees and our provision for doubtful accounts 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in this slight increase is primarily attributable to an increase in outside consulting expenses of million associated with the implementation of our internal computer systems 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily attributable to increases in personnel expenses of million to support our expanding operations and a million loss on disposal of a software asset in offset by decrease in bad debt expense of million 
in  we expect that general and administrative expenses will decrease slightly as compared to due to reduced headcount and other cost saving efforts initiated in stock based compensation 
total stock based compensation expenses were million in  million in and million in stock based compensation includes the amortization of unearned employee stock based compensation on options issued to employees prior to vitria completing its initial public offering in september and is being amortized over a five year vesting period 
during  we modified the stock option vesting terms of option grants made to two former executives 
in accordance with apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  we recorded  additional non cash stock based compensation expense in as a result of these grant modifications 
we expect to record employee stock based compensation expenses of approximately  and  for the years ending december  and  respectively 
unearned compensation expense will be reduced in future periods to the extent that options are terminated prior to vesting 
for the year ended december   we did not incur any stock based compensation expense in connection with stock issued to non employees for services 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded  and  respectively  of stock based compensation expense in connection with stock issued for services 
amortization and impairment of intangible assets 
amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets associated with the acquisition of xml solutions in april resulted in charges to earnings of million for the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  the million amortized in also includes million of amortized goodwill 
during the year ended december   we performed an assessment of the carrying value of our intangible assets under the provision of sfas see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in light of sustained negative economic conditions which impacted our operations and expected future revenues 
as a result of this assessment  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of  effectively reducing the carrying value of all intangible assets to zero 
this charge was based on a comparison of the fair value of the underlying intangible assets  which was calculated based on the discounted cash flows expected during their remaining useful lives  to their carrying value 
while our cash flow assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our underlying businesses  there is significant judgment in attributing cash flows to our intangible assets over their respective estimated useful lives 

table of contents impairment of goodwill 
we accounted for the acquisition of xmlsolutions in april under the purchase method of accounting which resulted in million of goodwill being recorded at the time of purchase 
goodwill associated with this purchase was amortized over its estimated life of three years in however  in accordance with safs  as referenced in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  beginning january   we discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
during the year ended december   we performed an assessment of the carrying value of our goodwill 
the assessment was performed because our market capitalization had declined significantly  on what was considered to be an other than temporary basis  and because sustained negative economic conditions have impacted our operations and expected future revenues 
we evaluated goodwill under the provisions of sfas see note of notes to consolidated financial statements during the second quarter of goodwill was tested for impairment by calculating the fair value of vitria as a whole  based on our market capitalization at june   and comparing the fair value to the book value of vitria  and then comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill with its carrying value 
as a result of this assessment  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to goodwill in the quarter ended june   effectively reducing the carrying value of goodwill to zero 
restructuring charges 
in the year ended december  we initiated actions to reduce our cost structure due to sustained negative economic conditions that have impacted our operations and resulted in lower than anticipated revenues 
in april and august  we reduced our workforce and consolidated our facilities 
the restructuring actions in resulted in a reduction in workforce of approximately employees or of our workforce measured as of the beginning of the workforce reductions affected all functional areas 
we also consolidated facilities in the united states and the united kingdom and wrote off related leasehold improvement and equipment 
we closed two buildings at our sunnyvale headquarters location and significantly reduced occupied space in our sales offices in dallas and herndon in the united states and in bracknell in the united kingdom 
as a result of the restructuring actions  we incurred a charge of million in the year ended december  the restructuring charge included approximately million of severance related charges and million of committed excess facilities payments which included  of written off leasehold improvements and equipment 
we expect to achieve annualized cost savings of approximately million from the restructuring actions initiated in the year ended december  the facilities consolidation charge of million was calculated using our best estimates and was based upon the remaining future lease commitments for vacated facilities from the date of facility consolidation  net of estimated future sublease income 
the estimated costs of vacating these leased facilities were based on market information and trend analyses  including information obtained from third party real estate sources 
we have engaged brokers to locate tenants to sublease these facilities  however  none of these facilities have been sublet to date 
as of december   million of committed facilities payments  net of anticipated sublease income  remains accrued and is expected to be fully utilized by in calculating the charge for facilities consolidation  certain assumptions were made with respect to the estimated time periods of vacancy and sublease rates and opportunities 
actual future circumstances could be materially different from our estimates and accordingly  the actual total charges associated with the vacated facilities could be materially higher or lower than estimated 
adjustments to the facilities consolidation charges will be made in future periods  if necessary  based upon then current actual events and circumstances 

table of contents the following is an estimated lease payout schedule  net of estimated sublease income in thousands year ending december  total estimated net payments future lease payments for restructured facilities estimated future sublease income net future lease payments on restructured facilities we expect to undertake additional restructuring actions in to further reduce expenses and better align our cost structure with anticipated revenue levels 
in january  we further reduced our workforce by approximately employees or of our workforce measured as of the beginning of the workforce reduction affected all functional areas 
we also plan to close additional facilities and write off related leasehold improvements in the quarter ending march  due to this restructuring action  we expect to take an additional charge of to million in the first quarter of acquired in process technology 
in process technology represents that portion of the purchase price of an acquisition related to the research and development activities which have not demonstrated their technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses 
accordingly  we recognized an expense of million in in conjunction with the completion of the acquisition of xmlsolutions for in process technology relating to xmlsolutions collaborative enablement program 
other income  net 
interest and other income decreased million  or  from million in to million in interest and other income decreased million  or  from million in to million in these decreases were mainly due to lower interest rates on our short term investments and lower interest generating cash and investment balances 
also in  we incurred a charge of  associated with an other than temporary decline in value of our equity in a private company 
in  we wrote off million from the value of our equity investments in two private companies  which was offset by a gain of million realized from the sale of another equity investment in a private company 
provision for income taxes we recorded income tax provisions of million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the provisions relate to income taxes currently payable on income generated in non us tax jurisdictions  state income taxes  and foreign withholding taxes incurred on software license revenues 
we have not recognized the benefits of deferred tax assets for any period  since inception  because the realization of such benefits cannot be reasonably assured 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources year ended december  percent change vs 
percent change vs 
in thousands working capital cash  cash equivalents and short term investments net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities as of december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents  million of short term investments  million of working capital  and million of long term liabilities 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  million of short term investments  million of working capital and  of long term liabilities 
we used million less in operating activities in than we did in this was due to a larger net loss in than  offset by a decrease in our accounts receivable balances due to higher cash collections as well as lowered revenues  and an increase in our accrued restructuring balance due to the restructuring actions we undertook in 
in  we used million more cash in our operating activities than we did in this was primarily due to an increase in our net loss over the prior year and a decrease in our deferred revenue balance 
during the year ended december   our net accounts receivable decreased million from million at december  to million at december  the reason for the decline was due to strong collections in and to lower revenues in the twelve months ended december  the lower revenue trend is likely to have a negative impact our future cash flows through at least the next quarter 
at december   our gross accounts receivable balance is million with an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
during the year ended december   our deferred revenue balance decreased million from million at december  to million at december  the primary reason for the significant decline is a decrease in our deferred revenue relating to support due to lower than anticipated license revenues in and declining maintenance renewal rates 
in addition  our deferred revenue relating to consulting has decreased due to the completion of projects that were initiated in net cash provided by investing activities increased million or in compared to in  net cash used in investing activities decreased million  or  compared to these changes in investing activities reflect the fact that in both and we used more cash from the maturities of our investments to fund our operations than we had in each preceding year  rather than re investing the funds when the investments matured 
net cash generated from financing activities consists primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock offset in by the purchase of treasury stock 
net cash generated from financing activities decreased million  or  from to this decrease was due to a lower number of stock option exercises during net cash generated from financing activities decreased million  or  from to the large decrease from to was due to our follow on offering of common stock in  which raised approximately million 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments at december   we had contractual obligations and commercial commitments of approximately million as shown in the table below 
the table below excludes obligations related to accounts payable and accrued liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business 
year ending december  and thereafter total minimum lease payment operating leases capital leases total operating lease commitments shown above include million of operating lease commitments under leases for abandoned facilities which were recorded as accrued restructuring expenses in the accompanying balance sheet as of december  we do not have any material commercial commitments under lines of credit  standby lines of credit  guarantees  standby repurchase obligations or other such arrangements 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  vitria did not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often refereed to as structured finance or special purposes entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
credit facilities with silicon valley bank in june  we entered into a million revolving line of credit agreement with silicon valley bank 
we amended this agreement in november interest on outstanding borrowings accrues at the bank s prime rate of interest 
the facility is secured by all of vitria s assets 
the agreement includes restrictive covenants which require us to maintain  among other things  a minimum cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments balance of million 
the line of credit serves as collateral for letters of credit and other commitments  even though these items do not constitute draws on the line of credit 
available advances under the line of credit are reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit and other commitments 
as of december   we had not borrowed against this line of credit 
in connection with the line of credit agreement  we have outstanding letters of credit of approximately million related to certain office leases at december  stock repurchase program in july  our board of directors announced a stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to an aggregate of five million shares of our common stock beginning on july  under the program the repurchases will be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market 
the repurchases will be funded from available working capital 
as of december    shares had been repurchased in the open market at a total cost of approximately  operating capital and capital expenditure requirements estimated future uses of cash over the next twelve months are primarily to fund operations and to a lesser extent to fund capital expenditures 
for the next twelve months  we expect to fund these uses from available cash 
table of contents balances  cash generated from operations  if any  and interest on available cash and investment balances 
our ability to generate cash from operations is dependent upon our ability to sell our products and services and generate revenue  as well as our ability to manage our operating costs 
in turn  our ability to sell our products is dependent upon both the economic climate and the competitive factors of the marketplace in which we operate 
in the past  we have invested significantly in our operations 
for the next year  we expect that operating expenses will decrease in absolute dollars due to restructuring actions and other cost reduction efforts 
however  we anticipate that operating expenses and planned capital expenditures will continue to constitute a material use of our cash resources 
we expect our capital expenditures in the next year to be at approximately the same level of spending as in fiscal year the lease for our headquarters building in sunnyvale expires in august  if we were to move to a different location  we believe we will incur up to million in leasehold improvements and moving expense in our actual expenses could be higher 
in addition  we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in other businesses  technologies or products lines 
we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating expense requirements for at least the next twelve months 
at some point in the future we may require additional funds to support our working capital and operating expense requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise these additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings 
if we need to seek additional financing  there is no assurance that this additional financing will be available  or if available  will be on reasonable terms and not dilutive to our stockholders 
we believe our success requires expanding our customer base and continuing to enhance our businessware products 
we intend to continue to invest selectively in sales  marketing and research and development and expect to incur operating losses for at least the first half of our revenues  operating results and cash flows depend upon the volume and timing of customer orders and payments and the date of product delivery 
historically  a substantial portion of revenues in a given quarter have been recorded in the third month of that quarter  with a concentration of these revenues in the last two weeks of the third month 
we expect this trend to continue and  therefore  any failure or delay in the closing of orders would have a material adverse effect on our quarterly operating results and cash flows 
since our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenues and because a high percentage of these expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in the recognition of revenue from one or more license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and cause unexpected results 
revenues from contracts that do not meet our revenue recognition policy requirements for which we have been paid or have a valid receivable are recorded as deferred revenues 
while a portion of our revenues each quarter is recognized from deferred revenue  our quarterly performance will depend primarily upon entering into new contracts to generate revenues for that quarter 
new contracts may not result in revenue during the quarter in which the contract was signed  and we may not be able to predict accurately when revenues from these contracts will be recognized 
our future operating results and cash flows will depend on many factors  including the following size and timing of customer orders and product and service delivery  level of demand for our professional services  changes in the mix of our products and services  ability to protect our intellectual property  actions taken by our competitors  including new product introductions and pricing changes  costs of maintaining and expanding our operations  introduction of new products  timing of our development and release of new and enhanced products  costs and timing of hiring qualified personnel  success in maintaining and enhancing existing relationships and developing new relationships with system integrators  
table of contents technological changes in our markets  including changes in standards for computer and networking software and hardware  deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of product enhancements or new products  delays in our ability to recognize revenue as a result of the decision by our customers to postpone software delivery  or because of changes in the timing of when delivery of products or services is completed  customer budget cycles and changes in these budget cycles  external economic conditions  availability of customer funds for software purchases given external economic factors  costs related to acquisition of technologies or businesses  ability to successfully integrate acquisitions  changes in strategy and capability of our competitors  and liquidity and timeliness of payments from international customers 
as a result of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
recently issued accounting pronouncements we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combination  on january  sfas requires that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method only and that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets apart from goodwill

fin  guarantor s disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of others 
fin clarifies the guarantor s requirements relating to the guarantor s accounting for  and disclosure of  the issuance of certain types of guarantees and requires the guarantor to recognize at the inception of a guarantee a liability for the fair value of the guarantee obligation 
fin also requires additional disclosures by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about the obligation associated with guarantees issued 
the provisions for the initial recognition and measurement of guarantees are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we have adopted the disclosure requirements for our financial statements included in this form k 
the accounting profession continues to discuss various provisions of this pronouncement with the objective of providing additional guidance on its application 
these discussions and the issuance of any new interpretations  once finalized  could lead to an unanticipated impact on our future financial results 
therefore  although we currently do not believe these provisions will have a material effect on our operating results or financial position  we will continue to evaluate the impact of fin in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas amends statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  and to require expanded and more prominent disclosure of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation 
while sfas does not amend sfas to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method  the disclosure provisions of sfas are applicable to all companies with stock based employee compensation  regardless of whether they account for that compensation using the fair value method of sfas or the intrinsic value method of apb since we account for our stock based compensation under apb  and have no current plans on switching to sfas  the impact of sfas will be limited to the interim reporting of the effects on net loss and loss per share if we accounted for stock based compensation under sfas sfas is effective for fiscal years ending after december  in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provision of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we do not expect that the adoption of fin will have a material effect on our operations results or financial condition 
beginning on january  we adopted fasb emerging issues task force no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements for the reasons described under the caption risks associated with vitria s business and future operating results 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio  which consists of short term money market instruments and debt securities with maturities between days and one year 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale  and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported  as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of tax 
unrealized gains and losses at december  were not material 
we have no cash flow exposure due to rate changes for cash equivalents and short term investments as all of these investments are at fixed interest rates 
the table below presents the principal amount of related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio 
short term investments are all in fixed rate instruments and have maturities of one year or less 
table of investment securities in thousands as of december fair value weighted average interest rate fair value weighted average interest rate cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash and investment securities foreign exchange risk as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
historically  our primary exposures have related to non us dollar denominated currencies  receivables  and inter company receivables or payables with our foreign subsidiaries 
additionally  we provide funding to our foreign subsidiaries in europe  asia pacific and latin america 
in order to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations  from time to time  we utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency transaction exposures outstanding during the period 
the gains and losses on the forward contracts help to mitigate the gains and losses on our outstanding foreign currency transactions 
we do not enter into forward contracts for trading purposes 
all foreign currency transactions and all outstanding forward contracts are marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in other income  net 
our outstanding forward contracts as of december  are presented in the table below 
this table presents the net notional amount in us dollars using the spot exchange rate in december and the weighted 
table of contents average contractual foreign currency exchange rates 
notional weighted average exchange rates are quoted using market conventions where the currency is expressed in units per us dollar 
all of these forward contracts mature within days or less as of december  currency sold forward net notional amount notional weighted average exchange rate in thousands euros british pounds total risks associated with vitria s business and future operating results our operating results fluctuate significantly and an unanticipated decline in revenue may disappoint securities analysts or investors and result in a decline in our stock price 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future 
if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price is likely to decline 
period to period comparisons of our historical results of operations are not necessarily a good predictor of our future performance 
our revenues and operating results depend upon the volume and timing of customer orders and payments and the date of product delivery 
historically  a substantial portion of revenues in a given quarter have been recorded in the third month of that quarter  with a concentration of these revenues in the last two weeks of the third month 
we expect this trend to continue and  therefore  any failure or delay in the closing of orders would have a material adverse effect on our quarterly operating results 
since our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenues and because a high percentage of these expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in the recognition of revenue from one or more license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and cause unexpected results 
our quarterly results depend primarily upon entering into new or follow on contracts to generate revenues for that quarter 
new contracts may not result in revenue in the quarter in which the contract was signed  and we may not be able to predict accurately when revenues from these contracts will be recognized 
our operating results are also dependent upon our ability to manage our cost structure 
we have incurred substantial operating losses since inception and we cannot guarantee that we will become profitable in the future 
we have incurred substantial losses since inception as we funded the development of our products and the growth of our organization 
we have an accumulated deficit of million as of december  during  we reduced our workforce by employees and consolidated certain facilities as part of our restructuring plan 
as a result of these actions  we incurred a charge of million  of which approximately million is comprised of severance related charges and million of committed excess facilities payments 
in addition  in january  we further reduced our workforce by employees and in march we took additional measures to consolidate our facilities 
despite these recent measures in order to remain competitive we intend to continue investing heavily in sales  marketing and research and development 
as a result  we are likely to continue report future operating losses and cannot guarantee whether we will report net income in the future 

table of contents our operating results are substantially dependent on license revenues from essentially one product  businessware and our business could be materially harmed by factors that adversely affect the pricing and demand for businessware 
since  a majority of our total revenues has been  and is expected to be  derived from the license of our businessware product and for applications built using that product 
accordingly  our future operating results will depend on the demand for businessware by existing and future customers  including new and enhanced releases that are subsequently introduced 
if our competitors release new products that are superior to businessware in performance or price  or we fail to enhance businessware and introduce new products in a timely manner  demand for our product may decline 
a decline in demand for businessware as a result of competition  technological change or other factors would significantly reduce our revenues 
failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products could reduce our ability to compete and result in lower revenues 
during  we had a net loss of million and our operating activities used million of cash 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  million in working capital  and million in long term liabilities 
we may need to raise additional funds  and we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
if we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms  we may not be able to  among other things develop or enhance our products and services  acquire technologies  products or businesses  expand operations  in the united states or internationally  hire  train and retain employees  or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements 
our failure to do any of these things could result in lower revenues and could seriously harm our business 
the challenging economic environment in the united states and abroad  and especially the continued reluctance of companies to make significant expenditures on information technology  could reduce demand for our products and cause our revenues to continue to decline 
the downturn in the us and the world economy may cause a further decline in capital allocations for software purchases 
the delay in capital expenditures may cause a decrease in sales  may cause an increase in our accounts receivable and may make collection of license and support payments from our customers more difficult 
over approximately the past two years  we have experienced a general slow down in the level of capital spending by some of our customers due to the general economic downturn  which has resulted in lower revenues 
this slow down in capital spending  if sustained in future periods  could result in reduced sales or the postponement of sales to our customers 
there can be no assurance that the level of spending on information technology in general  or on business integration software by our customers and potential customers  will increase or remain at current levels in future periods 
lower spending on information technology could result in reduced license sales to our customers  reduced overall revenues  diminished margin levels  and could impair our operating results in future periods 
in addition  international events threaten to deepen and prolong the challenging economic environment 
terrorism and the threat thereof  as well as actual or threatened war or hostilities in various regions  could cause companies further to delay or moderate their capital expenditures  thereby harming our financial performance 
we experience long and variable sales cycles  which could have a negative impact on our results of operations for any given quarter 
our product is often used by our customers to deploy mission critical solutions used throughout their organization 
customers generally consider a wide range of issues before committing to purchase our products  
table of contents including product benefits  ability to operate with existing and future computer systems  ability to accommodate increased transaction volume and product reliability 
many customers will be addressing these issues for the first time 
as a result  we or other parties  including system integrators  must educate potential customers on the use and benefits of our product and services 
in addition  the purchase of our products generally involves a significant commitment of capital and other resources by a customer 
this commitment often requires significant technical review  assessment of competitive products  and approval at a number of management levels within the customer s organization 
because of these issues  our sales cycle has ranged from six to nine months  and in some cases even longer  and it is very difficult to predict whether and when any particular license transaction might be completed 
in addition  the downturn in the us economy has caused some customers to increase budgetary controls or require additional management approvals within the customers organization prior to committing to significant capital purchases  either of which could result in an increased sales cycle 
because a small number of customers have in the past accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues  our revenues could decline due to the loss or delay of a single customer order 
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for of total revenues in the fiscal year ended december  our license agreements do not generally provide for ongoing license payments 
therefore  we expect that revenues from a limited number of customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of total revenues in future quarters 
our ability to attract new customers will depend on a variety of factors  including the reliability  security  scalability  breadth and depth of our products  and cost effectiveness of our products 
the loss or delay of individual orders could have a significant impact on revenues and operating results 
our failure to add new customers that make significant purchases of our product and services would reduce our future revenues 
if we are not successful in developing industry specific solutions based on businessware  our ability to increase future revenues could be harmed 
we have developed and intend to continue to develop solutions based on businessware which incorporate business processes  connectivity and document transformations specific to the needs of particular industries  including telecommunications  manufacturing  financial services  energy  insurance and healthcare industries 
this presents technical and sales challenges and requires collaboration with third parties  including system integrators and standard organizations  and the commitment of significant resources 
specific industries may experience economic downturns or regulatory changes that may result in delayed spending decisions by customers or require changes to our products 
if we are not successful in developing these targeted solutions or these solutions do not achieve market acceptance  our ability to increase future revenues could be harmed 
to date we have concentrated our sales and marketing efforts toward companies in the telecommunications  manufacturing  financial services  energy  insurance and healthcare industries 
customers in these new vertical markets are likely to have different requirements and may require us to change our product design or features  sales methods  support capabilities or pricing policies 
if we fail to successfully address these new vertical markets we may experience decreased sales in future periods 
our products may not achieve market acceptance  which could cause our revenues to decline 
deployment of our products requires interoperability with a variety of software applications and systems and  in some cases  the ability to process a high number of transactions per second 
if our products fail to satisfy these demanding technological objectives  our customers will be dissatisfied and we may be unable to generate future sales 
failure to establish a significant base of customer references will significantly reduce our ability to license our product to additional customers 

table of contents we are currently not in compliance with the nasdaq national market s listing criterion requiring us to maintain a minimum bid price of  and our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
on october   we received a letter from nasdaq advising us that our common stock had not met nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement of for consecutive trading days and that  if we were unable to demonstrate compliance with this requirement for at least consecutive trading days during the calendar days ending january   our common stock may be subject to delisting from the nasdaq national market 
on february   we received another letter from nasdaq  notifying us that we had failed to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
on march   we received a letter from nasdaq extending the compliance period to april if we are unable to regain compliance with the nasdaq national market requirements before april   we have several alternatives that may be available to us in order to avoid being delisted 
for example  in january  we filed with the sec a preliminary proxy relating to a special stockholders meeting we intended to convene to seek authorization from our stockholders to allow the board of directors to implement a reverse stock split with a ratio in the range of to to to that proxy was never finalized or mailed to stockholders and the board does not today have authority to implement a reverse stock split 
we could again seek such authorization from our stockholders  and if such authorization were to be granted  the board could choose to implement a reverse stock split 
while there is no guarantee that our stock price would continue to trade above for any period of time  a reverse stock split could allow us to forestall  at least temporarily  a delisting action by nasdaq 
in addition  upon our request and at the discretion of nasdaq  we could seek to have our common stock transferred to the nasdaq smallcap market 
transferring to the nasdaq smallcap market would provide us with an additional grace period to satisfy the minimum bid price requirement  however  we would nevertheless be subject to certain adverse consequences described below 
in addition  in such event we would still be required to satisfy various listing maintenance standards for our common stock to be quoted on the nasdaq smallcap market  including the minimum bid price requirement after expiration of any grace periods 
if we fail to meet such standards  our common stock would likely be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market and trade on the over the counter bulletin board  commonly referred to as the pink sheets 
such alternatives are generally considered as less efficient markets and would seriously impair the liquidity of our common stock and limit our potential to raise future capital through the sale of our common stock  which could materially harm our business 
if we are delisted from the nasdaq national market  we will face a variety of legal and other consequences that will likely negatively affect us including  without limitation  the following we may lose our exemption from the provisions of section of the california corporations code which imposes aspects of california corporate law on certain non california corporations operating within california 
as a result  i our board of directors would no longer be classified and our stockholders would elect all of our directors at each annual meeting  ii our stockholders would be entitled to cumulative voting  and iii we would be subject to more stringent stockholder approval requirements and more stockholder favorable dissenters rights in connection with certain strategic transactions  the state securities law exemptions available to us would be more limited and  as a result  future issuances of our securities may require time consuming and costly registration statements  due to the application of different securities law exemptions and provisions  we may be required to amend our stock option and stock purchase plans and comply with time consuming and costly administrative procedures  the coverage of vitria by securities analysts may decrease or cease entirely  and we may lose current or potential investors and customers 

table of contents our markets are highly competitive and  if we do not compete effectively  we may suffer price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
the market for our products is intensely competitive  evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
the intensity of competition is expected to increase in the future 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could significantly reduce our future revenues 
our current competitors include bea  ibm corporation  iona  microsoft corporation  mercator software  sybase  seebeyond technology  tibco software  and webmethods 
in the future  some of these companies may expand their products to provide or enhance existing business process management  business analysis and monitoring  and business vocabulary management functionality 
these or other competitors may merge to attempt the creation of a more competitive entity  or one that offers a broader solution than we provide 
in addition  in house information technology departments of potential customers have developed or may develop systems that provide for some or all of the functionality of our products 
we expect that internally developed application integration and process automation efforts will continue to be a principal source of competition for the foreseeable future 
in particular  it can be difficult to sell our product to a potential customer whose internal development group has already made large investments in and progress towards completion of systems that our product is intended to replace 
finally  we also face or may soon face direct and indirect competition from major enterprise software developers that offer integration products as a complement to their other enterprise software products 
these companies may also modify their applications to be more easily integrated with other applications through web services or other means 
some of these vendors include jd edwards  oracle  peoplesoft  siebel systems and sap ag 
many of our competitors have more resources and broader customer and partner relationships than we do 
in addition  many of these competitors have extensive knowledge of our industry 
current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to offer a single solution and increase the ability of their products to address customer needs 
although we believe that our solutions generally compete favorably with respect to these factors  our market is relatively new and is evolving rapidly 
we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors  especially those with significantly greater resources 
our revenues will likely decline if we do not develop and maintain successful relationships with system integrators 
system integrators install and deploy our products and those of our competitors  and perform custom integration of systems and applications 
some system integrators engage in joint marketing and sales efforts with us 
if these relationships fail  we will have to devote substantially more resources to the sales and marketing  and implementation and support of our product than we would otherwise have to  and our efforts may not be as effective as those of the system integrators 
in many cases  these parties have extensive relationships with our existing and potential customers and influence the decisions of these customers 
we rely upon these firms for recommendations of our product during the evaluation stage of the purchasing process  as well as for implementation and customer support services 
a number of our competitors have strong relationships with these system integrators and  as a result  these system integrators may recommend competitors products and services 
in addition  a number of our competitors have relationships with a greater number of these system integrators and  therefore  have access to a broader base of enterprise customers 
our failure to establish or maintain these relationships would significantly harm our ability to license and successfully implement our software product 
in addition  we rely on the industry expertise and reach of these firms 
therefore  this failure would also harm our ability to develop industry specific products 
we are currently investing  and plan to continue to invest  significant resources to develop and maintain these relationships 
our operating results could be harmed if these efforts do not generate license and service revenues necessary to offset this investment 
the cost and difficulty in implementing our product could significantly harm our reputation with customers  diminishing our ability to license additional products to our customers 
our products are often purchased as part of large projects undertaken by our customers 
these projects are complex  time consuming and expensive 
failure by customers to successfully deploy our products  or the failure 
table of contents by us or third party consultants to ensure customer satisfaction  could damage our reputation with existing and future customers and reduce future revenues 
in many cases  our customers must interact with  modify  or replace significant elements of their existing computer systems 
the costs of our products and services represent only a portion of the related hardware  software  development  training and consulting costs 
the significant involvement of third parties  including system integrators  reduces the control we have over the implementation of our products and the quality of customer service provided to organizations which license our software 
if our products do not operate with the many hardware and software platforms used by our customers  our business may fail 
we currently serve a customer base with a wide variety of constantly changing hardware  packaged software applications and networking platforms 
if our products fail to gain broad market acceptance  due to their inability to support a variety of these platforms  our operating results may suffer 
our business depends  among others  on the following factors our ability to integrate our product with multiple platforms and existing  or legacy  systems and to modify our products as new versions of packaged applications are introduced  the portability of our products  particularly the number of operating systems and databases that our products can source or target  our ability to anticipate and support new standards  especially internet standards  the integration of additional software modules under development with our existing products  and our management of software being developed by third parties for our customers or use with our products 
if we fail to introduce new versions and releases of our products in a timely manner  our revenues may decline 
we may fail to introduce or deliver new products on a timely basis  if at all 
in the past  we have experienced delays in the commencement of commercial shipments of our businessware products 
to date  these delays have not had a material impact on our revenues 
if new releases or products are delayed or do not achieve market acceptance  we could experience a delay or loss of revenues and cause customer dissatisfaction 
in addition  customers may delay purchases of our products in anticipation of future releases 
if customers defer material orders in anticipation of new releases or new product introductions  our revenues may decline 
our products rely on third party programming tools and applications 
if we lose access to these tools and applications  or are unable to modify our products in response to changes in these tools and applications  our revenues could decline 
our programs utilize java programming technology provided by sun microsystems 
we also depend upon access to the interfaces  known as apis  used for communication between external software products and packaged application software 
our access to apis of third party applications are controlled by the providers of these applications 
if the application provider denies or delays our access to apis  our business may be harmed 
some application providers may become competitors or establish alliances with our competitors  increasing the likelihood that we would not be granted access to their apis 
we also license technology related to the connectivity of our product to third party database and other applications and we incorporate some third party technology into our product offerings 
loss of the ability to use this technology  delays in upgrades  failure of these third parties to support these technologies  or other difficulties with our third party technology partners could lead to delays in product shipment and could cause our revenues to decline 

table of contents we could suffer losses and negative publicity if new versions and releases of our products contain errors or defects 
our products and their interactions with customers software applications and it systems are complex and  accordingly  there may be undetected errors or failures when products are introduced or as new versions are released 
we have in the past discovered software errors in our new releases and new products after their introduction which has resulted in additional research and development expenses 
to date  these additional expenses have not been material 
we may in the future discover errors in new releases or new products after the commencement of commercial shipments 
since many customers are using our products for mission critical business operations  any of these occurrences could seriously harm our business and generate negative publicity 
if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel  our ability to compete will be harmed 
we depend on the continued service of our key technical  sales and senior management personnel 
none of these persons are bound by an employment agreement 
the loss of senior management or other key research  development  sales and marketing personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results 
in addition  we must attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
we face significant competition for individuals with the skills required to develop  market and support our products and services 
we cannot assure that we will be able to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of these highly skilled employees 
if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights  we may lose these rights and our business may be seriously harmed 
we depend upon our ability to develop and protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights to distinguish our products from our competitor s products 
the use by others of our proprietary rights could materially harm our business 
we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements  to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  existing laws afford only limited protection 
attempts may be made to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our proprietary rights against unauthorized third party copying or use 
furthermore  policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and expensive litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights 
our products could infringe the intellectual property rights of others causing costly litigation and the loss of significant rights 
software developers in our market will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products in different software industry segments overlap 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  prevent product shipment or cause delays  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could harm our business 
patent litigation in particular has complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties 
in the event an infringement claim against us is successful and we cannot obtain a license on acceptable terms or license a substitute technology or redesign our product to avoid infringement  our business would be harmed 
furthermore  former employers of our current and future employees may assert that our employees have improperly disclosed to us or are using confidential or proprietary information 
our significant international operations may fail to generate significant product revenues or contribute to our drive toward profitability  which could result in slower revenue growth and harm our business 
we have opened international offices in countries including the united kingdom  japan  germany  france  italy  brazil  taiwan  korea  mexico  singapore  canada  australia and spain and intend to establish additional international offices 
during  of our revenue was derived from international markets 
we anticipate devoting significant resources and management attention to expanding international opportunities 
there are a number of challenges to establishing operations outside of the united states and we may be unable to successfully generate significant international revenues 
if we fail to successfully establish our products in 
table of contents international markets  we could experience slower revenue growth and our business could be harmed 
it may be difficult to protect our intellectual property in certain international jurisdictions 
we are at risk of securities class action litigation due to our expected stock price volatility 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities 
this risk is especially acute for us because technology companies have experienced greater than average stock price volatility in recent years and  as a result  have been subject to  on average  a greater number of securities class action claims than companies in other industries 
in november and in february  vitria and certain of our officers and directors were named as defendants in class action shareholder complaints 
this litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  and could seriously harm our business 
see item legal proceedings for more information regarding this litigation 
we have implemented anti takeover provisions which could discourage or prevent a takeover  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of delaware law  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these provisions include establishment of a classified board of directors requiring that not all members of the board of directors may be elected at one time  authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates  limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
section of the delaware general corporations law and the terms of our stock option plans may also discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of vitria 
in addition  as of december   our executive officers  directors and their affiliates beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
this could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of vitria and may make some transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders
