item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we derived approximately of our revenue in from three recurring sources royalties from franchisees  restaurant sales at company operated restaurants and brand contribution license fees from the sales of schlotzsky s deli brand products to the restaurant system and in the retail sector 
royalties are generally reported and collected weekly 
net restaurant sales are generally for cash or credit card at the time of the sales transaction 
we are in the process of enhancing and expanding the menu of the schlotzsky s deli system to increase the culinary sophistication of menu offerings and to improve nutritional value through increased offerings of lower calorie and reduced fat menu items 
at the same time  restaurant designs are being updated to complement the new menu and to improve restaurant efficiency and the quality of the customers dining experience 
these changes are intended to increase restaurant sales volumes and improve gross margins and restaurant profitability 
we expect to test the menu and format enhancements beginning with company operated restaurants in austin  texas  starting in the second quarter of and to introduce several of the successful enhancements throughout most of the schlotzsky s deli system in through we are also pursuing long term financing to fund an expansion of company operated leadership restaurants in key markets in texas and other states  to refinance certain shorter term or higher rate debt and to support operations 
potential financing alternatives include asset backed financing  secured by intellectual property and related royalty rights and agreements  and conventional real estate mortgages 
failure to obtain such financing would require us to significantly modify our growth strategies for company operated restaurants and reduce operating costs and capital expenditures 
during  we repaid the remaining outstanding balances under our bank group credit agreement with the proceeds of real estate mortgages  and completed the acquisition of the territorial rights of our largest area developer  primarily through a seller financed promissory note 
this acquisition improves our ability to grow the schlotzsky s deli system  particularly company operated restaurants  in this territory  which includes the dallas  houston  and san antonio markets  as well as all or parts of ten other states 
our revenues declined in due to factors such as economic difficulties in local economies and trade areas and increased competition 
these economic difficulties continued to depress sales levels across the system to below levels  and also had a tempering effect on franchisee development and new restaurant openings 
the termination of our former turnkey program in see below has also impacted new restaurant development 
we no longer build and develop restaurants for franchisees as we did from to through our turnkey program 
franchisees must now do so themselves 
while the turnkey program was successful in increasing systemwide sales  restaurant count and average weekly unit sales  the program involved our undertaking significant real estate development and credit risks 
as a result of the termination of the turnkey program  a non cash  pre tax charge of approximately  was recorded in the second quarter of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically 
actual results may vary from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and require subjective judgments 
changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly impact our results of operations and financial conditions in future periods 
determination of the appropriate valuation allowances for accounts and notes receivable 
our accounts and notes receivable are primarily from franchisees of the schlotzsky s deli system 
we require personal guarantees for all franchise accounts and  for notes receivable  generally obtain a secondary secured interest in the related property and equipment or rights 
many of the notes receivable are fully subordinated to the franchisee s senior mortgage debt 
in reviewing the adequacy of the valuation allowances for accounts and notes receivable  we consider factors such as historical collection experience  the value of personal guarantees and real property collateral  the franchisee s sales and operating trends  including potential for improvement in operations  and general economic conditions that may affect the franchisee s ability to pay 
actual realization of amounts receivable could differ materially from our estimates 
determination of appropriate valuation allowances for real estate held for sale 
our real estate held for sale consists primarily of pad sites 
as these sites are being actively marketed  they are periodically assessed for estimated net realizable value 
factors considered in this assessment are offers and letters of intent received on properties  discussions with local real estate brokers  property tax and bank appraisals  sale prices of similar properties and level of activity and interest exhibited by potential buyers 
actual realizeability could differ materially from our estimates 
determination of appropriate valuation allowance for intangible assets 
amortizing intangible assets consist primarily of amounts paid to reacquire various developer and franchise rights 
annually  and whenever an event or circumstances indicate impairment may be present  we compare projected undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the related assets to determine if impairment has occurred 
in estimating future cash flows  we consider such factors as current results  trends  future prospects  and other economic factors 
actual future cash flows could differ materially from our estimates

all cost components were adversely impacted by training and pre opening costs for company operated restaurants that will open in the future 
the use of some company operated restaurants in the long term portfolio for product  process and equipment testing and for systemwide training also adversely impacts their operating performance

off balance sheet arrangements we have outstanding guarantees of indebtedness of others  including related parties  of approximately million as of december  these guarantees include approximately million of lease guarantees for the benefit of franchisees  approximately million of mortgage loan guarantees for the benefit of franchisees and approximately million of loan guarantees for the benefit of related parties 
the lease guarantees for the benefit of franchisees arose primarily through our former turnkey program  in which we developed the restaurants  leased the restaurants to franchisees  and then sold them to a leasing company 
the guarantees range from limited guarantees  either in dollar amount or term  to full guarantees for the life of the lease 
the maximum guarantee for a single lease is approximately million 
certain guarantees extend through we may be required by the lessor to make monthly rental payments or property tax and common area maintenance payments if the franchisee does not make the required payments in a timely manner 
we have indemnification agreements with the franchisee under which the franchisee would be obligated to reimburse us for any amounts paid under such guarantees 
as of december   we had accrued a liability of approximately  related to these guarantees 
we also have net deferred gain related to the sale of these leases in the amount of approximately  as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the mortgage loan guarantees for the benefit of franchisees also arose primarily through our former turnkey program  in which we developed the related restaurants  sold the restaurant to a franchisee  and guaranteed all or a portion of the franchisee s mortgage loan 
the guarantees range from limited guarantees  either in dollar amount or term  to full guarantees of the mortgage 
the maximum amount of a single guarantee is approximately million 
certain guarantees extend through we may be required by the lender to make monthly mortgage payments if the franchisee does not make the required payments in a timely manner  or we may be required to make up any deficiency  up to the amount of the guarantee  if the related restaurant is sold for net proceeds less than the amount of the outstanding mortgage 
we have indemnification agreements with the franchisees under which the franchisee would be obligated to reimburse us for any amount paid under such guarantees 
in the event that we purchase the loan from the lender in the event of a default  we would succeed to the lender s security interest in the related property 
the loan guarantees in favor of related parties primarily arose when we guaranteed certain debt of related parties for which the proceeds of the loans were used to repay outstanding debt to us 
two of the guarantees  for the benefit of our restaurant venture and our real estate venture  are of mortgage debt  totaling approximately million 
these guarantees extend through on one note and through on the other note 
a third guarantee  in the amount of approximately million  is for the benefit of the advertising entity of the schlotzsky s deli restaurant system  for which we received the net proceeds of the loan in repayment of outstanding debt to us 
this guarantee expires in we have been called upon  from time to time  to make payments on obligations we have guaranteed 
during  we paid approximately  in various lease guarantees and approximately  under various loan guarantees  both for the benefit of franchisees 
in addition  pursuant to a guarantee of a franchisee s debt obligation  we expect to purchase that obligation from a bank  in the amount of approximately  in august liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased  in  increased  in  and decreased  in cash flows are impacted by operating  investing and financing activities 
operating activities provided   and  of cash in   and respectively 
the decrease in cash provided in as compared to was the net result of lower net income  lower provision for deferred taxes and uncollectible accounts and impairment of assets and a reduced use of cash for certain working capital accounts  partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization and lower amortization of deferred revenue 
the increase in cash provided in as compared to was the net result of a return to profitability after a net loss in  an increase in depreciation and amortization  and a reduced use of cash for certain working capital accounts  partially offset by decreased provisions for uncollectible accounts and impairment of assets 
investing activities used  of cash in   of cash in  and provided  of cash in the increase in cash used in as compared to was the net result of a reduction in net repayments on notes receivable  partially offset by a reduction in expenditures for property and equipment and proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 
the decrease in cash provided in compared to was the net result of an increase in expenditures for intangible assets  reduced net repayments of notes receivable  and a decrease in the amount of net proceeds received from the sale of property  equipment and real estate 
financing activities used  in   in  and  of cash in  respectively 
the use of cash in  and is due to the net repayment of debt 
additionally  we implemented a stock repurchase program in at december   we had approximately  of total debt outstanding 
during  we completely repaid all outstanding balances under our bank group credit agreement with the proceeds of mortgages on company operated restaurants and real estate 
during  we also exercised an option to acquire our largest area developer territory 
this acquisition was primarily financed through a promissory note to the seller 
the amount outstanding under this note was approximately  at december  certain of our mortgage debt requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios  including debt to equity and working capital 
while we are currently in compliance with these covenants  or have obtained waivers  any failure to comply in the future could have material adverse consequences to us 
the following tables present certain of our obligations and commitments to make future payments  excluding interest payments  under contracts and contingent commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt     operating leases     amount of commitment expiration per period other commercial commitments total amounts committed less than year years years over years guarantees     we plan to develop additional company operated restaurants 
two restaurants are under construction in the austin area  and are expected to open in the company has received a lending commitment for one of the restaurants 
the company has also acquired the building sites for two additional restaurants in the austin area 
sites for additional restaurants in texas and in other markets are under consideration 
we will require additional financing to execute our growth strategy for company operated restaurants and for other purposes 
we are pursuing financing alternatives  including asset backed financing secured by its intellectual property and related royalty rights and agreements  as well as real estate mortgages 
there can be no assurance that such financing can be arranged in acceptable amounts and on acceptable terms 
failure to obtain such financing would require us to significantly modify our growth strategies for company operated restaurants and reduce our operating costs and capital expenditures 
our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s outstanding common stock 
in   shares were repurchased for  in and  we repurchased an additional  shares at a total cost of approximately  quarterly comparisons we utilize a week quarterly reporting schedule for royalties  restaurant operations and royalty service costs 
fiscal years and included weeks 
for all other areas of the financial statements  we report all fiscal quarters as ending on march  june  september and december we believe that we experience only moderate seasonality  although first and fourth quarter systemwide contractual sales  which impact several revenue categories  are generally lower than the second and third quarter levels 
we attempt to make restaurant sales less seasonal by offering a variety of products that tend to sell better during various seasons

contractual sales are used in this chart  and throughout this report  because these sales are the basis of our royalty income and contractual sales are the only sales amounts reported to us by franchisees 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation did not have a material impact on our operations for the periods reported 
significant increases in labor  employee benefits  food costs and other operating expenses could have a material adverse effect on franchisees and company operated restaurant operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in short term interest rates on loans from financial institutions could materially affect our earnings because the interest rates charged on certain underlying obligations are variable 
at december   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately  in annual pre tax earnings 
the estimated decrease is based upon the increased interest expense of our variable rate debt and assumes no change in the volume or composition of debt at december
