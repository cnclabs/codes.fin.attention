item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in the understanding of cbiz s financial position and results of operations for each of the years ended december   and this discussion should be read in conjunction with cbiz s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
recent developments during  cbiz rationalized and sharpened the focus of its operations by selling  closing or committing to sale  the divestiture of sixteen businesses 
five of these operations have been classified as discontinued operations  in connection with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
eleven of these operations did not meet the criteria for treatment as discontinued operations and have been accounted for as gain loss on divested operations from continuing operations in the accompanying statements of operations 
cbiz will continue to divest those non strategic businesses that are either under performing  are located in secondary markets  or that do not provide the level of synergistic cross serving opportunities with other cbiz businesses that is desired 
although we cannot predict the proceeds for certain units or the resulting gain or loss  additional gains losses may be incurred as future transactions are completed 
in conjunction with the focus to rationalize the business  cbiz is also focused on acquiring businesses that will complement its service offerings in those primary markets where cbiz already has a significant presence 
during the fourth quarter of  cbiz acquired a benefits and insurance company to strengthen our presence in the maryland area 
operating practice groups cbiz currently delivers products and services through three practice groups 
below is a brief description of these groups operating results and factors affecting their businesses 
the services offered under each of these groups are described in part i of this report 
accounting  tax and advisory services 
the ata group contributed approximately million and million of revenue  or approximately and of cbiz s annual revenue in and  respectively 
the decrease in revenue attributable to divestitures completed during the year ended december  was million 
for ata businesses with a full period of operations for the year ended december   revenue decreased million  or 
this decrease in same unit revenue was primarily driven by the decrease for the demand in discretionary work  such as consulting projects and special work related to business transactions related to mergers and acquisitions  and a weak economy 
these decreases in revenue caused a decrease in gross margin from in to in cbiz expects its ata services group to achieve modest revenue growth  as well as improvement in gross margin in improvements in staff utilization  both internally and through the arrangement with harborview  are expected to contribute to margin improvement 
under the terms of the agreement between the two companies  cbiz is the exclusive provider of professional staff to harborview partners to conduct internal audits for engagements that harborview partners secures within the united states 
benefits and insurance services 
the benefits and insurance group contributed approximately million and million of revenue  or approximately and of cbiz s annual revenue in and  respectively 
the increase in revenue is attributable to organic growth  offset by the decrease in revenue related to divestitures completed during the year ended december  of million 
for benefits and insurance businesses with a full period of operations for the year ended december   same unit revenue increased million  or 
the gross margin decreased slightly from in to in cbiz s benefits and insurance group had benefited in the last year from a firming of premium prices  particularly for the group health and property and casualty products 
in addition  the worksite marketing division increased revenue and improved their profitability significantly  due to several large cases closed in however  reductions in equity values have caused revenue to decline on asset based fees  particularly in the pension and retirement areas 
due to a number of factors  including the increasing costs of health care and an aging population  cbiz expects premium pricing to remain stable 
national practices services 
the national practices group contributed approximately million and million of revenue  or approximately of cbiz s annual revenue in and  respectively 
included in the results of the national practices group are those of cbiz mmp  which contributed approximately million and million  or and  of cbiz s annual revenue in and  respectively 
cbiz mmp s revenue growth of is attributable to the addition of new clients  growth of existing clients and expansion into new markets  such as entrance into the western region of the united states during revenue for cbiz mmp is based on a percentage of patient accounts collected on behalf of their clients 
the gross margin decreased slightly from in to in due in part to medicare reimbursement costs and investment costs related to the expansion into new regions 
cbiz expects growth in revenue of cbiz mmp to continue  although we cannot assure that the growth will continue at the levels we have seen in the past year 
the other units within national practices  excluding cbiz mmp  contributed approximately million and million of revenue in and  respectively 
the decrease in revenue attributable to divestitures completed during the year ended december  was million 
for other national practices businesses with a full period of operations for the year ended december   revenue decreased million  or 
the decrease in same unit revenue was related to several areas  including the information technology it area  valuation and property tax services  and government relations 
this was offset by improvement in health care consulting and improvement in cbiz s mergers acquisition group 
the increase in capital management revenues was primarily affected by one significant transaction in the fourth quarter  the sale of its clients floors  inc  arvada hardwood floor co 
and floorworks inc to the home depot 
gross margins for other national practices decreased from in to in  primarily driven by valuation adjustments to inventory in the it group 
while cbiz targets large transactions of this nature in our mergers and acquisition business  we are not able to predict the timing or amount of these types of transactions  nor are we able to determine if they will continue in the future 
cbiz does expect modest growth in revenue for the other national practices  as well as margin improvement 
results of operations continuing operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues total revenue for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of million  or

a more comprehensive analysis of revenue is discussed above by operating practice groups 
expenses operating expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in  representing a decrease of million 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the divestiture of low margin businesses  as well as expense reductions initiated in the second quarter of to help bring compensation expenses back in line with revenue levels 
compensation expense excluding severance  which represents approximately of operating expenses  decreased by million  or 
these cost reductions were offset by charges for severance  restructuring and inventory adjustments 
as a result of expense reductions and continuing consolidation activities  cbiz incurred severance and restructuring costs of million for the year ended december   an increase of million

corporate general and administrative expenses represented of total revenues for the year ended december   compared to for the comparable period in depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in  representing a decrease of million  or 
the decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in goodwill amortization of million resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
which no longer allows for the amortization of goodwill

the results of these operations are disclosed separately on the consolidated financial statements and discussed separately under results of operations discontinued operations below 
other income expense  net was million of expense for the year ended december   as compared to million of income for the comparable period in  representing a change of approximately million 
other income expense  net is comprised primarily of interest income earned in cbiz s payroll business  gains and losses on the sale of assets  charges for legal reserves and settlements  and miscellaneous income  such as contingent royalties from previous divestitures 
the decrease in other income expense  net is primarily attributable to a million charge related to the write down of cbiz s investment in two high tech start up ventures  and a note taken in connection with the divestiture of the hazardous waste operation in  that were deemed impaired in in addition  interest income decreased million related to lower interest rates in cbiz recorded income tax expense from continuing operations of million for the year ended december   compared with million in the effective tax rate was for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for the year ended december   is higher than the statutory federal and state tax rates of approximately due to permanent differences such as non deductible goodwill related to the disposition of businesses

results of operations cumulative effect of change in accounting principle effective january   cbiz adopted statement of financial accounting standard no  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
cbiz finalized the required transitional tests of goodwill during  and recorded an impairment charge of million on a pre tax basis 
this non cash charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle net of tax benefit of million 
during the fourth quarter of  cbiz adopted securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in the financial statements 
sab summarizes certain of the commission s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
in light of the guidance to conform to sab and the sec s frequently asked questions and answers bulletin released on october   cbiz changed certain revenue recognition policies effective january  prior to this change cbiz s revenue recognition had been in accordance with gaap and industry standards 
due to this change  cbiz recorded a cumulative adjustment in the first quarter of million net of tax benefit of million 
the impact in of adopting sab resulted in a reduction in revenue of approximately million  a reduction in operating expense of approximately million  and a reduction in income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change of approximately million pretax 
financial condition total assets were million and total liabilities were million as of december  and shareholders equity was million 
current assets of million exceeded current liabilities of million by million at december  cash and cash equivalents increased million to million for the year ended december  restricted cash was million at december   an increase of million from a year ago 
restricted cash represents those funds held in connection with cbiz s nasd regulated operations and funds held in connection with the pass through of insurance premiums to the carrier 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements contained herein  funds held for clients were million  which is directly offset by client fund obligations 
cash  restricted cash and funds held for clients fluctuate during the year based on the timing of cash receipts and related payments 
accounts receivable were million at december   and declined by million from a year ago 
the decline in receivables was due to the improvement in collection of amounts due  divestitures  and the write off of certain accounts that were deemed uncollectible 
other assets  including notes receivable and property and equipment  are carried at amounts that cbiz reasonably estimates reflect the value of these assets  considering current circumstances and future expectations 
goodwill and other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  decreased million  primarily due to impairment for goodwill of million recorded in as a result of the adoption of sfas the accounts payable balance of million at december  reflects amounts due to suppliers and vendors 
other current liabilities increased million to million at december  the change primarily reflects the recording of anticipated costs related to restructuring and accrued compensation expense 
client fund obligations of million were directly related to funds held for clients in the same amount as reflected in current assets 
cbiz s credit facility was million at december   a reduction of million from december  the reduction in debt was a result of cbiz s positive cash flow generated during liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities in was million versus million in  a decrease of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was the principal source of funds used to reduce cbiz s bank debt by million 
net cash used in investing activities during of million consisted of million in proceeds from the disposition of non core and underperforming business units and million collected on notes receivable offset by million used for capital expenditures  and million used toward the acquisition of a benefits and insurance firm  and funding provided under the harborview agreement 
capital expenditures consisted of leasehold improvements and equipment in connection with the consolidation of certain offices  it capital to support the growth of the medical management practice  and equipment purchases in relation to normal replacement 
the majority of capital expenditures represent investment in technology related items including hardware and software  both to improve back office functions and to provide better solutions for our clients 
cash used in investing activities during of million consisted of million in proceeds from the disposition of non core and underperforming business units and million of collections on notes receivables 
these proceeds were offset by million used for capital expenditures  million used toward the acquisition of a technology services business and contingent consideration for previous acquisitions earn outs  and million funding provided under the harborview agreement 
capital expenditures consisted of leasehold improvements and equipment in connection with the consolidation of certain offices and equipment purchases in relation to normal replacement 
during the year ended december   cash used in financing activities of million consisted of a net reduction in the bank credit facility of million 
on september  cbiz entered into a new senior secured credit agreement with a group of four banks  as described below under sources of cash 
cbiz expects to use the facility for working capital  internal growth initiatives  and its acquisition program 
cash used in financing activities in of million consisted primarily of net reduction of million in the revolving credit facility and net payments of million toward notes payable and capitalized leases 
in addition  approximately million in cash was used toward the purchase of  shares of cbiz s common stock  in accordance with cbiz s share repurchase program approved by the board of directors on august  sources of cash cbiz s principal source of net operating cash is derived from the collection of fees from professional services rendered to its clients and commissions earned in the areas of accounting  tax  valuation and advisory services  benefits consulting and administration services  insurance  human resources and payroll solutions  capital advisory  retirement and wealth management services and technology solutions 
on september  cbiz entered into a new senior secured credit agreement with a group of four banks 
the new million facility carries an option to increase the facility to million and allows for the allocation of funds for strategic initiatives  including acquisitions and the repurchase of cbiz stock 
cbiz expects to use the facility for working capital  internal growth initiatives  and its acquisition program 
the facility has a three year term with an expiration date of september the new credit agreement is secured by all assets and capital stock of cbiz and its subsidiaries and allows for greater operating flexibility as it pertains to acquisitions and the use of funds for the repurchase of cbiz stock 
under the new credit agreement  cbiz is subject to a monthly borrowing base related to accounts receivable and unbilled revenues  and is required to meet certain financial covenants 
these covenants require cbiz to meet certain requirements with respect to i minimum tangible net worth  ii maximum leverage ratio  and iii a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
cbiz is in compliance with its covenants as of december  and projects that it will remain in compliance in at december   cbiz had million outstanding under its credit facility 
management believes that the available funds from the credit facility  along with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs in the foreseeable future 
see note to cbiz s consolidated financial statements included herewith 
uses of cash and liquidity outlook cbiz s capital expenditures from continuing operations totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  which included expenditures for fixed assets for normal replacement  implementation of the enterprise wide solution to integrate back office operations and other initiatives  office consolidations  compliance with regulations and market development 
during the year ended december   cbiz principally funded capital expenditures from operating cash flow and financing activities 
in  capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million  and cbiz anticipates that during  it will continue to fund these expenditures from operating cash flow supplemented by borrowings under its revolving credit agreement  as necessary 
at december   based on the borrowing base calculation  cbiz had approximately million of available funds under its credit facility 
management believes that those available funds  along with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs in the foreseeable future 
to fund operations  capital expenditures and potential acquisitions  cbiz may also obtain funding by offering securities or debt  through the public markets or the private markets 
cbiz currently has a number of shelf registrations active  under which we can offer such securities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements contained herein for a description of the aforementioned registration filings 
cbiz s aggregate amount of obligations for the next five years and thereafter is set forth below in thousands thereafter principal payments of bank debt  letters of credit principal payments of notes payable and capitalized leases  obligations under non cancelable operating leases       total       interest rate risk management cbiz entered into an interest rate swap agreement in the third quarter of to reduce the impact of potential rate increases on variable rate debt through its credit facility 
the interest rate swap was entered into with a notional amount of million  a fixed libor rate of  and a maturity date of august during  primarily as a result of continued strong cash flow from operations  cbiz continued to reduce its outstanding debt  therefore  to maintain an effective hedge cbiz reduced the notional amount of the swap to million 
cbiz accounts for the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge  whereby the fair value of the interest rate swap is reflected as an asset or liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the interest rate swap hedging instrument matches the notional amount  interest rate index and re pricing dates as those that exist under the variable rate debt through its credit facility hedged item 
when the interest rate index is below the fixed rate libor  the change in fair value of the instrument represents a change in intrinsic value  which is an effective hedge 
this portion of change in value will be recorded as other comprehensive income loss 
for the year ended december   the change in fair value resulted in a loss of approximately million  which is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
critical accounting policies the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to the understanding of cbiz s consolidated financial statements because their application places significant demand on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that estimates may require adjustment if future events develop differently than forecasted 
revenue recognition and valuation of unbilled revenues revenue is recognized only when all of the following are present persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our fee to the client is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured  which is in accordance with gaap and sab cbiz offers a vast array of products and outsourced business services to its clients 
those services are delivered through three practice groups 
a description of revenue recognition  as it relates to those groups  is provided below accounting  tax and advisory services revenue consists primarily of fees for accounting services  preparation of tax returns and consulting services 
revenues are recorded in the period in which they are earned 
cbiz bills clients based upon a predetermined agreed upon fixed fee or actual hours incurred on client projects at expected net realizable rates per hour  plus any out of pocket expenses 
the cumulative impact on any subsequent revision in the estimated realizable value of unbilled fees for a particular client project is reflected in the period in which the change becomes known 
benefits insurance revenue consists primarily of brokerage and agency commissions  and fee income for administering health and retirement plans 
a description of the revenue recognition  based on insurance product and billing arrangement  is described below commissions relating to brokerage and agency activities whereby cbiz has primary responsibility for the collection of premiums from insured s agency or indirect billing are generally recognized as of the earlier of the effective date of the insurance policy or the date billed to the customer 
commissions to be received directly from insurance companies direct billing are generally recognized when the amounts are determined 
life insurance commissions are generally recognized when the amounts are determined 
commission revenue is reported net of sub broker commissions 
contingent commissions are recognized at the earlier of notification or cash collection 
fee income is recognized as in the period earned  and may be based on actual hours incurred on an hourly fee basis  fixed fee arrangements  or asset based fees 
national practices the business units that comprise this practice group offer a variety of services 
a description of revenue recognition associated with the primary services is provided below mergers acquisitions and capital advisory revenue associated with non refundable retainers are recognized on a pro rata basis over the life of the engagement 
revenue associated with success fee transactions are recognized when the transaction is completed 
technology consulting revenue associated with hardware and software sales are recognized upon delivery and acceptance of the product 
revenue associated with installation and service agreements are recognized as services are performed 
consulting revenue is recognized on an hourly or per diem fee basis 
valuation and property tax revenue associated with retainer contracts are recognized on a pro rata basis over the life of the contract  which is generally twelve months 
revenue associated with contingency arrangements is recognized once written notification is received from an outside third party eg  assessor in the case of a property tax engagement acknowledging that the contingency has been resolved 
medical practice management revenue is recognized when payments are received on our clients patient accounts 
valuation of accounts receivable and notes receivable the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
specifically  management must make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable  including unbilled accounts receivable  related to current period service revenue 
management analyzes historical bad debts  client credit worthiness  and current economic trends and conditions when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts and the collectibility of notes receivable 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
material differences may result if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
valuation of goodwill effective january   cbiz adopted the non amortization provisions of sfas  and accordingly ceased amortization of our remaining goodwill balance 
cbiz evaluated the goodwill for impairment using the new fair value impairment guidelines of sfas during  cbiz completed the process of evaluating our goodwill for impairment using the new fair market impairment guidelines of sfas this change to a new method of accounting for goodwill resulted in a non cash impairment charge of million on a pretax basis million net of tax  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
valuation of investments cbiz has certain investments in privately held companies that are currently in their start up or development stages and are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages 
the value of these investments is influenced by many factors  including the operating effectiveness of these companies  the overall health of the companies industries  the strength of the private equity markets and general market conditions 
during  cbiz recorded charges of approximately million related to the impairment of certain investments held 
although the market value of these investments is not readily determinable  management believes their current fair values approximate their carrying values as of december  in light of the circumstances noted above  particularly with respect to the current economic environment  it is possible that the fair value of these investments could decline in future periods  and further impairment could occur 
loss contingencies loss contingencies  including litigation claims  are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires analysis that often depends on judgment about potential actions by third parties 
estimates of incentive compensation costs and effective income tax rates incentive compensation costs and income tax expense are two significant expense categories that are highly dependent upon management estimates and judgments  particularly at each interim reporting date 
in arriving at the amount of expense to recognize  management believes it makes reasonable estimates and judgments using all significant information available 
incentive compensation costs are accrued on a monthly basis  and the ultimate determination is made after our year end results are finalized  thus  estimates are subject to change 
circumstances that could cause our estimates of effective income tax rates to change include the impact of information that subsequently became available as we prepared our corporate income tax returns  the level of actual pre tax income  revisions to tax positions taken as a result of further analysis and consultation  and changes mandated as a result of audits by taxing authorities other significant policies other significant accounting policies not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above are nevertheless important to understanding the consolidated financial statements 
those policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the statement is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  and it is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosures  an amendment to sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions are effective for the year ended december   and the interim disclosure requirements are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which addresses the disclosure to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees 
fin requires the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of certain guarantees  specifically recognition of a liability for the non contingent component of the guarantee  which is the obligation to stand ready to perform in the event that specified triggering events or conditions occur  even if it is not probable that the payments will be required under the guarantee or if the guarantee was issued with a premium payment or as part of a transaction with multiple elements 
cbiz has adopted the disclosure requirements effective for the year ended december  cbiz will apply the initial recognition and measurement provisions effective for all guarantees issued or modified after december  other than letters of credit that are issued in the normal course of business  cbiz does not enter into guarantees and therefore does not expect the adoption of fin to have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vies which have the characteristics of equity investments at risk not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support from other parties  or vies in which the equity investor lacks essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
fin applies to vies created after january  and to vies in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
cbiz will adopt the provisions of fin in item a

cbiz s floating rate debt under its credit facility exposes the company to interest rate risk 
a change in the federal funds rate  or the reference rate set by the bank of america san francisco  would affect the rate at which cbiz could borrow funds under its credit facility 
if market interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately and uniformly by basis points from the levels at december   interest expense would increase or decrease by million annually 
cbiz has entered into an interest rate swap to minimize the potential impact of future increases in interest rates
