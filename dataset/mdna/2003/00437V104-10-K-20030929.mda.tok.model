overview we provide specialty retail pharmacy services for the treatment of patients with costly  chronic diseases 
we derive revenues primarily from the sale of drugs to patients 
we focus almost exclusively on a limited number of complex and expensive drugs that serve small patient populations 
the following table presents the percentage of our total revenues generated from sales with respect to the diseases that we primarily served in the years ended june hemophilia  autoimmune disorders and pid multiple sclerosis pulmonary arterial hypertension gaucher disease growth hormone related disorders respiratory syncytial virus the increases in revenues from the diseases hemophilia  autoimmune disorders  pid and pah and the related decreases in revenues from the diseases multiple sclerosis  gaucher  growth hormone related disorders and rsv are primarily due to the acquisition of the sps division 
the majority of the revenues of the sps division related to hemophilia  autoimmune disorders  pid and pah 
sales and services with respect to multiple sclerosis  gaucher disease  rsv  pah and growth hormone related disorders are dependent upon our relationships with biogen  genzyme  medimmune  glaxosmithkline  actelion pharmaceuticals us  united therapeutics and genentech 
our agreements with these 
table of contents manufacturers describe the services to be provided by us  including contract pharmacy  information  clinical  reimbursement and customized delivery services 
these agreements generally allow the manufacturer to distribute directly or through other parties  and are short term and may be cancelled by either party  without cause  upon between and days prior notice 
these agreements vary in level of exclusivity and scope of services provided 
we typically purchase products at prices at or below the manufacturers average wholesale sales prices  and our resulting contribution margins vary for each product line 
pricing is customized to reflect specific services to be provided by us and in some cases is subject to periodic adjustments to reflect changing market conditions 
a few of these agreements limit our ability to supply competing drugs during and in some cases up to five years after the term of the agreement 
we purchase drugs for hemophilia and autoimmune disorders from all available sources on a volume discount basis 
we are one of the national assignment of benefits providers selected by medimmune  inc to distribute drugs for rsv 
during  we began providing specialty retail pharmacy services for the treatment of patients with pah 
we distribute all three of the drug therapies for this disease 
we recognize revenue in the period the drugs are delivered or when we have performed the contractual service 
while we may experience revenue changes from price fluctuations on our existing product lines  our revenue growth will depend principally on the introduction of new drugs and on volume growth in existing drug lines 
reimbursement for the products we sell comes from governmental payors  medicare and medicaid  and non governmental payors 
the following table presents the percentage of our total revenues reimbursed by these payors year ended year ended year ended june  june  june  non governmental governmental medicaid medicare the increase in medicare reimbursement and the related decrease in non governmental reimbursement from fiscal year to fiscal year is due to the revenues from hemophilia factor and the pah products  flolan and remodulin  as a result of the acquisition of the sps division 
these are the only products we distribute for which we are reimbursed directly by medicare 
we anticipate that our payor mix for fiscal year will be similar to the payor mix achieved in fiscal year we have five joint venture agreements with various medical centers or their affiliates in which we own of each venture and one joint venture agreement with a medical center affiliate in which we own of the joint venture 
many of our patient populations have diseases that are discovered before or during adolescence and require ongoing care from physician specialists  many of whom are based at pediatric  academic and other acute care medical centers 
to date  these ventures have primarily derived revenues from the treatment of patients with hemophilia  growth hormone related disorders and rsv 
we share profits and losses with our joint venture partners in equal proportion to our respective equity ownership 
we account for our interests in the net income or loss in our owned joint ventures under the equity method of accounting and in our owned joint venture under the consolidated method of accounting 
our equity interest in the net income of the owned joint ventures represented approximately of our income before income taxes in each of the years ended june   and cost of sales include drug acquisition costs  pharmacy and warehouse personnel costs  freight and other direct costs associated with the delivery of our products and costs of clinical services provided 
general and administrative expenses include the personnel costs of the reimbursement  sales  marketing  administrative 
table of contents and support staffs as well as corporate overhead and other general expenses 
bad debts include our provision for patient accounts receivable which we estimate will prove to be uncollectible after routine collection efforts have been exhausted 
we typically hire personnel and incur legal  recruiting  marketing and other expenses in anticipation of the commercial launch of a new biopharmaceutical drug 
in some instances  a portion of these expenses are reimbursed to us by the biopharmaceutical manufacturer 
we have not historically capitalized any of these start up expenses 
due to the increasing sensitivity to drug cost within governmental and non governmental payors  we are continuously susceptible to reimbursement and operating margin pressures 
in recent years  pharmacy benefit managers and other non governmental payors have aggressively attempted to discount their reimbursement rates for our products 
this aggressive discounting has resulted in some reduced margins for some of our products and services 
many government payors  including medicare and medicaid  pay us directly or indirectly for some of the drugs that we sell at the drugs awp or a percentage discount off awp 
recent government investigations into the reporting of awp by drug manufacturers have led first databank  inc to publish a market price survey of drugs that significantly reduces reimbursement for a number of the clotting factor and the ivig products we sell 
a number of state medicaid agencies now pay us for clotting factor at the prices shown on the market price survey or at a percentage discount off those prices 
other states have not changed their pricing structure or have changed back to their pre market price survey reimbursement rates 
recent medicare prescription drug benefit bills in both houses of congress  as well as a proposed rule issued by cms offer changes to the way the federal government pays for certain part b drugs 
with respect to medicare  the senate is proposing to reduce clotting factor reimbursement from awp minus to awp minus while the house is proposing a new rate of average selling price plus 
on august   cms proposed a new rule that would revise the methodology for determining payment for part b covered drugs and biologicals 
in the proposed rule  cms offered four alternative approaches 
according to cms  depending upon which program is adopted  the new payment methodology could be in place as early as january  similarly  california s medicaid program  medi cal  recently adopted a plan that will shift away from use of the discounted awp  instead using average selling price plus for hemophilia factors 
california has not yet determined exactly how it will calculate average selling price 
other states have proposed or are considering similar changes to their pharmacy payment plans 
we expect that these developments will reduce prices and margins on some of the drugs that we distribute 
both federal and state legislators are continuing to scrutinize the healthcare industry for the purpose of reducing healthcare costs 
while we are unable to predict what  if any  future healthcare reform legislation may be enacted at the federal or state level  we expect continuing pressure to limit expenditures by governmental healthcare programs  which could impact the amount of revenue we receive 
approximately  and of gross patient revenues excluding the acute business acquired from gentiva for the years ended june   and  respectively  was from medicare and state sponsored medicaid programs 
with the purchase of the sps division the percentage of our revenue reimbursed by medicare and medicaid was higher in when compared to the percentages experienced by us prior to the acquisition 
acquisition on june   we acquired the sps division of gentiva 
we acquired substantially all of the assets used in the sps division including of the outstanding stock in three of gentiva s subsidiaries that were exclusively in the business conducted by the sps division 
the sps business provides specialty retail pharmacy and related services relating to the treatment of patients with certain costly chronic diseases 
in addition to the diseases previously served by us  the sps business is also a leading provider of specialty pharmacy and related services to patients with pah 
as a result of the acquisition  we have become a leading provider of specialty retail pharmacy and related services  as measured by revenue 
the aggregate purchase price was million including million of acquisition related costs and consisted of million 
table of contents of cash and  shares of common stock valued at million 
the results of the sps business have been included in the consolidated financial statements since june  results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated  the percentages of total revenues represented by the respective financial items years ended june  revenues net patient revenue other revenue equity in net income of joint ventures total revenues operating expenses cost of sales general and administrative bad debts restructuring charge depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income interest income expense  net income before minority interest and income taxes minority interest income before income taxes income tax expense net income critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates  and different assumptions or conditions may yield different estimates 
the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows revenue recognition net patient revenues are from the sales of biopharmaceutical drugs to patients and are reported at the net amount billed to patients  third party payors and others in the period the products are delivered 
we have agreements with certain third party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts discounted from their established rates 

table of contents from time to time we enter into management contracts with hemophilia treatment centers  medical centers and joint ventures in which we have an interest 
pursuant to these contracts  we will provide certain billing  pharmacy dispensing  inventory management  shipping  reimbursement  collection and other management services in exchange for fees that range from a reimbursement of our costs to a percentage of the managed entities billed charges  less contractual allowances 
these contracts are for terms of up to five years and are usually cancelable on short notice 
revenue from the management contracts is recognized when the services are rendered and is included in other revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts the procedure for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant judgment and assumptions 
our primary collection risks are for patient co payments and deductibles 
the risk of collection varies based upon the product  the payor and the patient s ability to pay the amounts not reimbursed by the payor 
some of the drugs we distribute are primarily reimbursed by prescription card benefit plans  which reimbursement is subject to lower co payment and deductible amounts typically per prescription 
other drugs are primarily reimbursed through major medical benefit plans  which reimbursement is subject to higher deductible amounts 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon a variety of factors including the age of the outstanding receivables and our historical experience of collecting the patient co payments and deductibles 
however  economic and other factors could result in collections that differ from our estimates 
we continually review the estimation process and make changes to the estimates as necessary 
allowance for contractual discounts we are reimbursed for the drugs we sell by many different payors including insurance companies  medicare and all of the state medicaid programs 
the revenues and related accounts receivable are recorded net of payor contractual discounts to reflect the estimated net billable amounts for the products delivered 
we estimate the allowance for contractual discounts on a payor specific basis  given our interpretation of the contract terms or applicable regulations 
however  the reimbursement rates are often subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from our estimates 
additionally  updated regulations and contract negotiations occur frequently  necessitating our continual review and assessment of the estimation process 
patient credit balance liability patient credit balances arise due to many factors including overpayments from payors  unapplied payments due to insufficient information and payments against invoices that have previously been written off 
we estimate the amount of credit balances that relate to overpayments from payors based upon historical trends and other available information and classify those credit balances as accounts payable in the financial statements 
medical claims reserves we maintain self insured medical and dental plans for employees 
claims expense is accrued under these plans as the incidents that give rise to them occur 
we use a third party administrator to process all such claims 
unpaid claim accruals are estimated based on historical costs of settlement and average lag times 
we believe that the estimation methodology used effectively captures our medical claims costs  however  payments could differ from our estimates due to changes in the healthcare cost structure or changes in the volume of claims filed 
asset impairment management periodically evaluates the carrying values of long lived assets  including property and equipment  to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that these assets have been impaired 
an asset is considered impaired when undiscounted cash flows to be realized from such asset are less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is determined based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of such asset 

table of contents effective on july   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement addresses the accounting and reporting of goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
since adoption of sfas no 
in july  amortization of goodwill has discontinued  and goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment based on a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is necessary to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we have one reporting unit and the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount resulting in no impairment charges in fiscal year income taxes we are subject to audit by federal and state tax authorities 
these audits could result in proposed assessments that challenge certain tax positions  which  if upheld through the administrative and legal process  could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flow 
we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law  and we do not anticipate any material impact on earnings or cash flows 
change in accounting estimate in preparing our financial statements  we are required to make certain estimates  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  refundable credit balances  self insurance accruals  income tax liabilities and impairment tests on goodwill 
we periodically review our estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in our business or as new information becomes available 
during the march quarter  we analyzed historical collection rates and other data used in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our calculations indicated that the accounts receivable reserve needed to be increased 
as a result of the new information obtained through the analysis completed subsequent to the march quarter  in the third quarter of fiscal year we recorded a net million charge to bad debt expense and increased the allowance for doubtful accounts related to the accounts receivable of the sps division 
fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  revenues 
total revenues increased from million to  million from fiscal year to fiscal year net patient revenues increased from million to  million from fiscal year to fiscal year the increase in revenues is attributable to the sps acquisition completed on june  and volume growth in our products for the treatments of growth hormone disorders  hemophilia  gaucher disease and autoimmune disorders as a result of the addition of new patients and additional sales of product to existing patients 
we also had a significant increase in our seasonal drug synagis for the treatment of rsv as a result of increased patient volume 
we also benefited from the addition of new and expanded contracts with managed care organizations 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased from million to  million from fiscal year to fiscal year  which is commensurate with the increase in our revenues discussed above 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of sales decreased from to from fiscal year to fiscal year resulting in gross margins of in fiscal year and in fiscal year gross margins for the individual products have remained relatively stable  however  a change in product mix resulted in an increase in the composite gross margin in fiscal year the primary drivers were increased revenues from hemophilia factor  ivig for the treatment of autoimmune disorders and flolan for the treatment of pah  which have lower acquisition costs as a percentage of revenue than most of the other products we distribute 

table of contents general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from million to million  or  from fiscal year to fiscal year the increase is due to the sps acquisition completed on june  and increased salaries and benefits associated with the expansion of our reimbursement  sales and marketing  administrative and support staffs and the addition of office space and related furniture and fixtures to support the revenue growth 
general and administrative expenses represented and of revenues for fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase to in fiscal year is due to product mix changes 
the higher margin products  which were a higher percentage of our total revenues in fiscal year  have higher general and administrative expenses associated with them than many of the other product lines that we distribute 
bad debts 
bad debts increased from million to million from fiscal year to fiscal year as a percentage of revenues  bad debt expense increased from to from fiscal year to fiscal year the increase in expense is primarily due to the change described above in change in accounting estimate 
during the march quarter  we analyzed historical collection rates and other data used in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our calculations indicated that the accounts receivable reserve needed to be increased 
as a result of the new information obtained through the analysis completed subsequent to the march quarter  in the third quarter of fiscal year we recorded a net million charge to bad debt expense and increased the allowance for doubtful accounts related to the accounts receivable of the sps division 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation expense increased from million to million from fiscal year to fiscal year as a result of the assets acquired in the sps acquisition  purchases of property and equipment associated with our revenue growth and the expansion of our leasehold facility improvements 
amortization expense related to other intangible assets increased from million to million from fiscal year to fiscal year due to the sps acquisition 
interest income expense  net 
interest income  net was million in fiscal year and interest expense  net was million in fiscal year the change  amounting to million  is primarily due to the debt outstanding during fiscal year that was incurred in june to finance the cash portion of the sps acquisition and the related acquisition costs 
income tax expense 
our effective tax rate decreased from to from fiscal year to fiscal year the difference between the recognized effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate is primarily attributed to state income taxes 
fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  revenues 
total revenues increased from million to million from fiscal year to fiscal year acquisitions completed during accounted for million of the increase in total revenues 
net patient revenues increased from million to million from fiscal year to fiscal year acquisitions completed during accounted for million of the increase in net patient revenues 
in fiscal year  we experienced growth in our products for the treatments of multiple sclerosis  growth hormone disorders  hemophilia and gaucher disease and autoimmune disorders as a result of volume growth with the addition of new patients  additional sales of product to existing patients and acquisitions 
we also had a significant increase in our seasonal drug synagis for the treatment of rsv as a result of increased patient volume 
we also benefited from the addition of new and expanded contracts with managed care organizations 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased from million to million from fiscal year to fiscal year  which is commensurate with the increase in our revenues discussed above 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of sales decreased from to from fiscal year to fiscal year resulting in gross margins of in fiscal year and in fiscal year gross margins for the individual products have remained relatively stable  however  a change in product mix resulted in an increase in the composite gross margin in fiscal year the primary drivers were increased revenues from hemophilia factor  ivig for the treatment of autoimmune disorders and flolan for the treatment of pah  which have lower acquisition costs as a percentage of revenue than most of the other products we distribute 

table of contents general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from million to million  or  from fiscal year to fiscal year acquisitions completed during accounted for million of the increase in general and administrative expenses 
the balance of the increase was primarily the result of increased salaries and benefits associated with the expansion of our reimbursement  sales and marketing  administrative and support staffs and the addition of office space and related furniture and fixtures to support the revenue growth 
general and administrative expenses represented and of revenues for fiscal years and  respectively 
bad debts 
bad debts decreased from million to million from fiscal year to fiscal year as a percentage of revenues  bad debt expense decreased from to from fiscal year to fiscal year the decrease in bad debts as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the increased percentage of our revenues that was reimbursed by prescription card benefits versus major medical benefit plans 
the majority of the reimbursement for both avonex and synagis is being provided by prescription card benefit plans  and therefore is subject to much lower co payment and deductible amounts typically per prescription resulting in lower bad debt 
restructuring charge 
in connection with the acquisition of the sps business  we recorded a restructuring charge of million 
the charge includes a million write off of which million is non cash of a software application we were developing that will not be implemented as a result of the decision to enhance and implement company wide the software application acquired with the sps business 
the restructuring charge also includes million for future lease commitments that will be abandoned once the facility integration plan related to the acquisition has been completed 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation expense increased from million to million from fiscal year to fiscal year as a result of purchases of property and equipment associated with our revenue growth and the expansion of our leasehold facility improvements 
amortization expense associated with goodwill and other intangible assets decreased from million to million from fiscal year to fiscal year due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  during the first quarter of fiscal year the application of the non amortization of goodwill provisions resulted in a reduction in amortization expense net of income taxes of approximately million or per diluted share 
interest income expense  net 
interest income  net decreased from million to million from fiscal year to fiscal year the decrease is due to a decrease in the average amount of cash invested during the year primarily as a result of cash used for acquisitions and earn out payments related to prior year acquisitions and a decrease in the interest rate earned on the amounts invested 
in addition  we incurred million in debt on june  to acquire the sps division of gentiva health services 
income tax expense 
our effective tax rate decreased from to from fiscal year to fiscal year the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the adoption of the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
discussed above 
the difference between the recognized effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate is primarily attributed to state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources as of june  and june   we had working capital of million and million  respectively 
our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  this increase is due to the sps acquisition and the timing of the collection of receivables  inventory purchases and payments of accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash used by investing activities was million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  cash used by investing activities in the year ended june  consisted primarily of million for acquisitions  which included a million earn out payment related to a fiscal year acquisition  million for purchases of property and equipment and million of undistributed earnings from our joint ventures 
cash used by investing activities in fiscal 
table of contents consisted primarily of million for acquisitions most of which related to the acquisition of the sps business  million for purchases of property and equipment  million of undistributed earnings from our joint ventures less million for net sales of marketable securities 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended june  and million was provided by financing activities for the year ended june  cash used in financing activities for the year ended june  consisted primarily of million of repayments on our credit facility less million from the issuance of common stock 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended june  consisted primarily of million of net borrowings on our credit facility  which was used to acquire the sps business in june historically  we have funded our operations and continued internal growth through cash provided by operations 
capital expenditures amounted to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year we anticipate that our capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending june  will consist primarily of additional computer hardware  enhancements to our fully integrated pharmacy and reimbursement software system and costs to build out and furnish additional space needed to meet the needs of our growth 
we expect the cost of our capital expenditures in fiscal year to be approximately million  exclusive of any acquisitions of businesses 
we expect to fund these expenditures through cash provided by operating activities and or borrowings under the revolving credit agreement with our bank 
during  we amended our million revolving credit facility with bank of america  na and other participating banks collectively the lenders to increase the size of the credit facility to million 
the credit facility consists of a million revolving commitment expiring june  a million term loan tranche a term loan due in periodic principal payments through march  and a million term loan tranche b term loan due in periodic principal payments through march the amount available to borrow under this credit facility is based upon certain ratios calculated as of the end of each quarter 
based upon the asset coverage ratio as of june   the total amount available to borrow is approximately million 
as of june   the total amount outstanding under the credit facility was million  which included million under the tranche a term loan and million under the tranche b term loan 
amounts outstanding under the credit agreement bear interest at varying rates based upon a london inter bank offered rate libor or prime rate of interest as selected by us  plus a variable margin rate based upon our leverage ratio as defined by the credit agreement 
the combination of a variable rate margin and libor base rate resulted in an effective rate of and at june  and  respectively 
our obligations under the credit agreement are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets  including a pledge of all of the common stock or partnership interest of each of our subsidiaries in which we own an or more interest 
the lenders security interest in a portion of our inventory is subordinate to the liens on that inventory under the terms of a security agreement between one of our vendors and us 
the same vendor has a security interest in certain accounts receivable  which is subordinate to the rights of the lenders 
the credit agreement contains financial covenants  including requirements to maintain certain ratios with respect to leverage  fixed charge coverage  net worth and asset coverage  each as defined in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement also includes customary affirmative and negative covenants  including covenants relating to transactions with affiliates  uses of proceeds  restrictions on subsidiaries  limitations on indebtedness  limitations on mergers  acquisitions and asset dispositions  limitations on investments  limitations on payment of dividends and stock repurchases  and other distributions 
the credit agreement also contains customary events of default  including events relating to changes in control of our company 
the credit agreement required us to enter into a one year interest rate swap agreement within days of june   to protect against fluctuations in interest rates 
the credit agreement required the interest rate swap to provide coverage in an amount equal to at least of the outstanding principal amount of the loans 
on july   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement effectively converting for a period of one year million of floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings with a fixed rate of  plus the applicable margin rate as determined by the credit agreement 
on june   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement effectively converting for a period of one year beginning july   million of 
table of contents floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings with a fixed rate of  plus the applicable margin rate as determined by the credit agreement 
on may   we amended the credit agreement to exclude the charges  as defined in the amendment to the credit agreement  taken in the march quarter in connection with the additional accounts receivable reserves of the sps division from the calculation of consolidated ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  and to reduce the consolidated net worth requirement  as defined in the credit agreement  to allow for a reduction in the minimum net worth requirement equal to the net loss incurred in the march quarter 
the amendment also included a basis point increase in interest rates per the credit agreement for a period of twelve months beginning may  previously  we had effectively converted  for the period through october   million of floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings 
we had secured a fixed interest rate exclusive of the margin rate using an interest rate swap agreement 
on august   in conjunction with the repayment of the outstanding principal balance of our revolving line of credit  we surrendered our swap agreement and received  in consideration for the early termination of the agreement 
on february   the securities and exchange commission sec declared effective our shelf registration statement on form s providing for the offer  from time to time  of various securities  up to an aggregate of million 
the shelf registration statement may enable us to more efficiently raise funds from the offering of securities covered by the shelf registration statement  subject to market conditions and our capital needs 
we believe that our cash from operations  cash available under the revolving credit facility and the proceeds from any offering of debt or equity securities allowed by the shelf registration statement will be sufficient to meet our internal operating requirements and growth plans for at least the next months

is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  and must be applied prospectively by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of the statement and still existing at the 
table of contents beginning of the interim period of adoption 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations since we do not currently have any financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
impact of inflation changes in prices charged by the biopharmaceutical manufacturers for the drugs we dispense  along with increasing labor costs  freight and supply costs and other overhead expenses  affect our cost of sales and general and administrative expenses 
historically  we have been able to pass all  or a portion  of the effect of such increases to the biopharmaceutical manufacturers pursuant to negotiated adjustments made under our preferred distribution agreements 
as a result  changes due to inflation have not had significant adverse effects on our operations 
forward looking information certain matters discussed in the preceding pages of this form k  particularly regarding implementation of the our strategy  development of new drugs by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  anticipated growth and revenues  anticipated working capital and sources of funding for growth opportunities  expenditures  interest  costs and income constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended see item risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to the impact of financial market risk is significant 
our primary financial market risk exposure consists of interest rate risk related to interest that we are obligated to pay on our variable rate debt 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage some of our exposure to rising interest rates on our variable rate debt  primarily by entering into variable to fixed interest rate swaps 
we have fixed the interest rate through july  on million of our variable rate debt through the use of a variable to fixed interest rate swap 
as a result  we will not benefit from any decrease in interest rates nor will we be subjected to any detriment from rising interest rates on this portion of our debt during the period of the swap agreement 
accordingly  a basis point decrease in interest rates along the entire yield curve would not increase pre tax income by million for the year as would be expected without this financial instrument 
however  a basis point increase in interest rates along the entire yield curve would also not decrease pre tax income by million for the same period as a result of using this derivative financial instrument 
for the remaining portion of our variable rate debt  we have not hedged against our interest rate risk exposure 
as a result  we will benefit from decreasing interest rates  but rising interest rates on this portion of our debt will also harm us 
accordingly  if we maintain our current level of total debt  a basis point decrease in interest rates along the entire yield curve would result in an increase in pre tax income of approximately million for the year 
however  a basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in pre tax income of million for the same period 
actual changes in rates may differ from the hypothetical assumptions used in computing the exposures in the examples cited above
