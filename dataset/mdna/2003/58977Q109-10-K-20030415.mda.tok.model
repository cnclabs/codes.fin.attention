item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general meridian is an independent oil and natural gas company that explores for  acquires and develops oil and natural gas properties utilizing d seismic technology 
our operations are focused on the onshore oil and gas regions in south louisiana  the texas gulf coast and offshore in the gulf of mexico 
our reserves and strategic acreage position provide us with a significant presence in our areas of focus  enabling us to manage a large asset base and to add successful exploratory and development wells at relatively low incremental costs 
as of december   we had proved reserves of bcfe  approximately of which were natural gas  with a present value of future pre tax cash flows pv of million 
we own interests in approximately  gross  net acres  including fields and wells  and we operate approximately of our total production 
the company s business model utilizing d seismic technology to explore for large reserve accumulations in areas where others have overlooked or not encountered commercial hydrocarbons because of the inability to resolve structures or recognize hydrocarbon indicators with traditional d seismic data  has prove successful 
during the period of  meridian generated and participated in the discovery of over bcfe of natural gas and oil 
as demonstrated from the apparent declines in domestic production  fewer and fewer economic projects are being recognized by the domestic industry 
this is partly a result of better technology that has improved the industry s ability to determine probabilities of success  thereby impacting the number of economic prospects available for drilling 
in addition  the conditions of the industry price volatility and uncertainty as well as declining prospect opportunities and the overall economy have influenced the availability of debt and equity capital for small capitalization companies such as meridian 
this  combined with the geological geophysical and mechanical risks associated with drilling primarily deep  high pressured wills with large working interests  has resulted in a shift in the company s strategy for exploration 
recognizing the trend and risks resulting therefrom  beginning in  management embarked on its current strategy to continue to utilize its application of d seismic technology to generate and drill shallower  higher confidence  lower risk plays  such as its biloxi marshlands project in st 
bernard parish  louisiana  blended with its traditional deeper  higher risk  but higher potential opportunities where its capital expenditure budget permits 
we have a large  balanced inventory of exploration  exploitation and development drilling prospects in our producing region 
in addition to a solid reserve base and acreage position in our area of focus  we believe we possess the technical knowledge and information necessary to sustain successful growth 
with licenses and rights to over  square miles of d seismic data and  linear miles of d seismic data  our technical and professional staff is in a unique position to continue to generate future prospects for our growth 
our strategy 
the key elements of our strategy are as follows generate reserve additions through exploration  exploitation and development drilling of a balanced portfolio of high potential prospects  when appropriate  oil and natural gas reserves will be purchased and or disposed of when deemed beneficial 
see management liquidity plans on page maintain a concise geographic focus applying professional and technical knowledge and experience to the development of a high quality project inventory  apply a disciplined methodology utilizing d seismic technology to reduce exploration risk  improve the probability of success  optimize well locations and reduce our finding costs  maximize percentage ownership in each drilling prospect relative to probability of success  increasing the impact of discoveries on shareholder value  and maintain operational control to manage quality  costs and timing of our drilling and production activities 
we use a disciplined approach in the generation of drilling projects  which forms the basis of the company s ability to grow its reserves  production and cash flow 
the company s process of review begins with a thorough analysis of each project area using traditional geological methods of prospect development  combined with computer aided technology to analyze all available d and d seismic data and other geological and geophysical data with respect to the opportunity 
in addition  from time to time  we may purchase producing properties through acquisitions that have substantial additional drilling opportunities associated with them 
the company has forecasted between million and million in capital expenditures for  subject to adjustment depending on drilling results  the number of wells drilled  drilling conditions and other factors 
the expenditures will be spent primarily on the development of its recently acquired biloxi marshlands exploration exploitation play in south louisiana 
should additional funding be obtained  capital expenditures could be increased by million to million 
recent developments 
as previously announced  meridian successfully completed its biloxi marshlands well  located in st 
bernard parish  louisiana during the fourth quarter of the well reached a total depth of  measured depth  tvd and encountered over of net pay in the targeted cris i sand 
the well was placed on production on march   and is currently producing at a gross rate of approximately  mcf per day  which represents an increase of approximately of current daily production 
during march  the company participated in the state of louisiana oil and gas lease sale  and successfully bid on five additional tracts in the area covering approximately acres in and around this play 
the company s working interest in the biloxi marshlands no 
well is net revenue interest is 
several additional development and exploratory wells are planned in the area during following the drilling of the biloxi marshlands well  the company constructed a barge based production facility and installed approximately five miles of pipeline capable of processing and transporting the production from the current well and future wells on the biloxi marshland acreage 
meridian expects to begin the second phase of its d seismic program on the biloxi marshlands acreage during april the survey will encompass at least square miles and is expected to be complete during the third quarter of the hughes no 
well in jefferson davis parish  louisiana has been drilled to a total depth of  measured depth and a completion in the bol mex sand series is currently underway 
the well is a replacement for the hughes no 
that experienced cementing problems during the completion phase and was subsequently abandoned 
during february  the company completed the construction of production facilities for the hughes no 
and is currently conducting final completion operations on the well 
because of the small wellbore at depth and the difficulties experienced with the cementing of the casing in the hughes no 
well  the company attempted an open hole completion 
this attempt was not a successful as desired but did not preclude future alternative methods of completion 
it is currently planned to clean out the bore and to complete the well under more traditional methods 
meridian is the operator of the well and owns an approximate working interest and a net revenue interest in the well 
also in jefferson davis parish  louisiana  in the company s thornwell field  meridian participated in the drilling of the blank living trust well  which encountered of pay at a depth of 
the well was placed on production flowing at a rate of  mcfe and barrels of oil per day during the fourth quarter of this field continues to generate new drill sites beyond early expectations 
the company has identified several additional amplitude anomalies which it expects to include in our drilling program for the company owns an approximate working interest and a net revenue interest in the well 
recompletion operations are expected to be underway on the thibodaux no 
well in the company s ramos field within the next days 
once recompleted to the operc interval  the company expects the well to produce at rates of  mcfe per day or more 
meridian is operator of the ramos field and owns a working interest and a net revenue interest in the well 
in the lakeside field located in cameron parish  louisiana  meridian completed its lacassane no 
well in the thick alliance sand at a depth of approximately 
the well initially tested at rates of  mcfe of gas per day from the lower part of the sand and additional perforations are now being added to include the thicker upper member 
the company owns a working interest net revenue interest in the well 
the capital expenditure budget for is currently forecast between million and million for seismic and drilling activity  primarily focused in the biloxi marshlands project area 
the first development well is the biloxi marshlands well which is scheduled for april other operations are expected to include a  well in ship shoal block  and certain other shallow  lower risk opportunities including additional wells in the biloxi marshlands project area 
as previously announced  the company has changed its exploration focus to concentrate on multiple shallower  low risk projects with broad exploitation development potential interspersed with one or more of the company s traditional higher risk  but much higher potential  projects 
industry conditions 
our revenues  profitability and cash flow are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas 
oil and natural gas prices have been extremely volatile in recent years and are affected by many factors outside of our control 
the average price we received during the year ended december  was per mcfe compared to per mcfe during the year ended december  fluctuations in prevailing prices for oil and natural gas have several important consequences to us  including affecting the level of cash flow received from our producing properties  the timing of exploration of certain prospects and our access to capital markets  which could impact our revenues  profitability and ability to maintain or increase our exploration and development program 
refer to item a for a discussion of commodity price risk management activities utilized to mitigate a portion of the near term effects of this exposure to price volatility 
full cost ceiling write down 
during  a negative revision in oil and natural gas proved undeveloped reserves associated with the kent bayou field resulted in the company recognizing a full cost ceiling write down totaling million million after tax of its oil and natural gas properties 
a decline in oil and natural gas prices caused us to recognize million in full cost ceiling write downs during due to the potential volatility in oil and gas prices and their effect on the carrying value of our proved oil and gas reserves  there can be no assurance that future write downs will not be required as a result of factors that may negatively affect the present value of proved oil and natural gas reserves and the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties  including volatile oil and natural gas prices  downward revisions in estimated proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities and unsuccessful drilling activities 
results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues decreased million as a result of decreased production volumes and a decrease in average commodity prices 
the production decrease was primarily a result of the property sales completed during  hurricane related production losses and natural production declines  partially offset by the inclusion of new wells being placed on production 
the following table summarizes meridian s operating revenues  production volumes and average sales prices for the years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease production oil mbbls   natural gas mmcf   natural gas equivalent mmcfe   average sales price oil per bbl natural gas per mcf natural gas equivalent per mcfe gross revenues s oil   natural gas   total   interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased million to million in  compared to million for this decrease was primarily due to a lower average amount of invested funds and lower interest rates during than in a significant portion of the interest income for was earned on the investment of funds accumulated from the sale of properties and a common stock offering during these funds had been accumulated to exercise the option to buy back the company s preferred stock and six million shares of the company s common stock from shell on january  operating expenses 
oil and natural gas operating expenses decreased million to million in  compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to the sale of high cost  non core properties during and the reorganization of field operations over the last thirteen months partially offset by the inclusion of costs associated with returning the company s properties to production following hurricanes 
this reorganization involved a reduction in field operating personnel and increased emphasis on operating cost reductions 
in addition  the company undertook an expanded well workover program during in order to benefit from the higher commodity prices being realized at the time 
severance and ad valorem taxes 
severance and ad valorem taxes decreased million to million in  compared to million in this decrease is largely attributable to the decrease in natural gas production and the decrease in oil revenues from the levels  partially offset by an increase in the average tax rate for natural gas 
meridian s production is primarily from southern louisiana  and  therefore  is subject to a current tax rate of of gross oil revenues and per mcf for natural gas 
the tax rate for natural gas for the first half of was per mcf and from july through june was per mcf 
depletion and depreciation 
depletion and depreciation expense decreased million to million in from million for this decrease was primarily a result of the decrease in production on an mcfe basis from  partially offset by an increase in the depletion rate from levels primarily due to the write down of the proved reserves associated with the kent bayou field 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense decreased million to million in compared to million for the year this reduction was primarily due to the savings realized from staff reductions and the purchase and termination of certain outstanding well bonus plan interests at the end of interest expense 
interest expense decreased million to million in compared to million for the decrease is primarily a result of the reduction in the debt balance and the federal reserve bank s decrease in overall interest rates which has led to a decrease in the average interest rate on the revolving credit facilities 
full cost ceiling writedown 
during  a negative revision in oil and natural gas proved undeveloped reserves associated with an unsuccessful well drilled in the kent bayou field resulted in the company recognizing a full cost ceiling write down totaling million million after tax of its oil and natural gas properties 
a decline in oil and natural gas prices caused us to recognize million in full cost ceiling write downs during credit facility retirement costs 
during  the company replaced its chase manhattan bank credit facility with a new three year million underwritten senior secured credit agreement with societe generale and fortis capital corp 
deferred debt costs associated with the prior credit facility of million were written off in year ended december   compared to year ended december  operating revenues and production 
oil and natural gas revenues decreased million as a result of decreased production volumes partially offset by improved commodity prices 
the production decrease was primarily a result of the property sales in and and natural production declines  partially offset by the inclusion of new wells being placed on production

interest and other income decreased million to million in  compared to million for this decrease was primarily due to invested funds during from the sale of properties and the common stock offering that was being accumulated for the amount required to exercise the option to buy back the company s preferred stock and six million shares of the company s common stock from shell in january operating expenses 
oil and natural gas operating expenses decreased million to million in  compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the number of wells from the sale of high cost  non core properties and reorganization of field operation resulting in greater efficiencies partially offset by non recurring expenses from an expanded well workover program and higher lifting costs on marginal wells 
severance and ad valorem taxes 
severance and ad valorem taxes decreased million to million in  compared to million in this decrease is largely attributable to the decrease in production from levels partially offset by an increase in the tax rate for natural gas 
meridian s production is primarily from southern louisiana  and  therefore  is subject to a current tax rate of of gross oil revenues and per mcf for natural gas 
the tax rate for natural gas for the first half of was per mcf and from july through june was per mcf 
depletion and depreciation 
depletion and depreciation expense decreased million to million in from million for this decrease was primarily a result of the decrease in production on an mcfe basis from  partially offset by an increase in the depletion rate  reflecting the sale of non core properties 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense decreased million to million in compared to million for the year this decrease was primarily a result of staff reductions and decreases in salaries  wages  and other compensation related to the provisions of the net profits and well bonus plans 
the plans provide for bonus payments to employees  which are calculated using a formula derived from the actual net profits on each well in the plan for the previous year 
decreased payouts in have resulted primarily due to decreased production volumes and the purchase and termination of certain well bonus plans during the latter portion of the year 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million to million in compared to million for the decrease is primarily a result of the overall reduction in debt and the federal reserve bank s decrease in overall interest rates which has led to a decrease in the average interest rate on the credit facility 
liquidity and capital resources working capital 
as of december   we had a cash balance of million and a working capital deficit of million 
the company is evaluating a number of opportunities to raise additional funds 
a part of the company s focus is to satisfy our immediate funding obligations under our various debt agreements and to implement a plan that will accomplish an orderly reduction and restructuring of our debt capital  while taking advantage of the strong asset base built over the years 
as a part of the restructuring and ultimate reduction of our debt  it is our intent to add future reserves primarily through low risk  d based drilling while maintaining a disciplined approach to costs 
credit facility 
during august  the company replaced its chase manhattan bank credit facility with a new three year million underwritten senior secured credit agreement the credit agreement with societe generale  as administrative agent  lead arranger and book runner  and fortis capital corp  as co lead arranger and documentation agent 
deferred debt costs associated with the prior credit facility of million were written off in september the current borrowing base under the existing credit agreement was established on september   at million  with the borrowing base redetermination date scheduled for november  the parties to the credit agreement have entered into an amendment of the agreement  effective march   to eliminate the november   redetermination date and to reschedule the borrowing base redetermination date for april   and quarterly redetermination thereafter 
the current borrowing base is million  which is the same as that established upon the signing of the original credit agreement 
on march   the company received notice from its senior lenders that effective april  the borrowing base will be established at million 
accordingly  the company has reflected the difference of million as a current maturity of its long term debt and will be required to make up the deficiency through the addition of reserves or value to its current reserve base or pay the senior lenders this deficiency within days of the effective date of april  though no assurances can be made that sufficient funds will be available to pay this deficiency  management believes that it can satisfy this deficiency through a combination of the addition of reserves  third party financing  property sales and cash flow 
see management liquidity plans on page for further discussion 
in addition to the scheduled quarterly borrowing base redeterminations  the lenders under the credit agreement have the right to redetermine the borrowing base at any time once during each calendar year and the company has the right to obtain a redetermination by the banks of the borrowing base once during each calendar year 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by pledges of outstanding capital stock of the company s subsidiaries and a mortgage on the company s oil and natural gas properties of at least of its present value of proved properties 
the credit agreement contains various restrictive covenants  including  among other items  maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on cash dividends on common stock and an unqualified audit report on the company s consolidated financial statements beginning with those as of and for the year ended december  the company has received from the senior lenders a waiver of the covenant that would have triggered an event of default as a result of the independent auditors report which contained a going concern modification for our consolidated financial statements 
borrowings under the credit agreement mature on august  under the new credit agreement  the company may secure either i an alternative base rate loan that bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the administrative agent s prime rate plus an additional to depending on the ratio of the aggregate outstanding loans and letters of credit to the borrowing base  or a federal funds based rate plus of or ii a eurodollar base rate loan that bears interest  generally  at a rate per annum equal to the london interbank offered rate libor plus to  depending on the ratio of the aggregate outstanding loans and letters of credit to the borrowing base 
the credit agreement also provides for commitment fees ranging from to per annum 
subordinated credit agreement 
the company extended and amended a short term subordinated credit agreement with fortis capital corporation for million on april   with a maturity date of december  the interest rate is the libor plus through december   libor plus from january   through august   and libor plus from september   through december  note payments of million each are due on august   and april   with the remaining million payable on december  note payments totaling million were paid in  with an additional million being paid in january an additional million that is currently due has been deferred in conjunction with the march   amendment to the credit agreement 
no amounts are payable under this subordinated debt until any and all borrowing base deficiencies under the credit agreement are satisfied 
convertible subordinated notes 
during june  we completed private placements of an aggregate of million of our convertible subordinated notes due june  the notes 
the notes are unsecured and contain customary events of default  but do not contain any maintenance or other restrictive covenants 
interest is payable on a quarterly basis 
during march  the company and the holders of the notes amended the conversion price from to per share 
the notes are convertible at any time by the holders of the notes into shares of the company s common stock  par value utilizing the conversion price 
the conversion price is subject to customary anti dilution provisions 
the holders of the notes have been granted registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock that would be issued upon conversion of the notes or issuance of the warrants discussed below 
we may prepay the notes at any time without penalty or premium 
management liquidity plans 
as noted in our discussion of the credit facility  there will be a million borrowing base deficiency at april  that must be satisfied by either sufficient additions to our proved reserves or repayment on or before july  to avoid an event of default 
an event of default which is not cured results in the entire debt outstanding becoming due and payable  unless it is waived by the senior lenders or the credit agreement is otherwise amended 
also  repayment of million  after our million january payment  under our subordinated debt agreement is due but is deferred pending satisfaction of the borrowing base deficiency under the amended credit agreement 
the million subordinated debt repayment that will become due in august is also subject to deferral for any borrowing base deficiencies that may exist at that time 
the million due in under these agreements represents a significant component of our million working capital deficiency at december  based upon our expected level of production and considering a reduced level of capital spending plan of to million  we project that our available cash flow from operations is not expected to be sufficient to fund the april  borrowing base deficiency and amounts due or to become due in under our subordinated debt agreement 
in order to address this liquidity issue and address the broader issue of aligning our capital structure with our long term business strategy  the following plans to sell non strategic oil and gas properties and secure new sources of capital through subordinated debt or similar financing arrangements have been initiated 
in an effort to address the liquidity issue and the broader issue of aligning our capital structure with our long term business strategy  the company is pursuing several plans that it believes will remedy the current borrowing base deficiency of million 
first  it should be noted that  as of december   the company s proved developed reserves have a present value based on sec regulations that include prices in effect at year end and a discount rate  of approximately million or approximately three times its total senior credit facility 
based on current cash flow projections and the company s specific knowledge of its drilling prospects and historical performance in the areas of anticipated activity  potential opportunities for non strategic property sales and or third party capital funding  it is management s judgment and belief that its business plan will provide the company with the means to meet the required coverage for the new borrowing base by a combination of newly discovered reserves  proceeds from strategic sales of non essential properties  where appropriate  and or the infusion of third party capital in the form of sub debt  all on or before july currently  the company has scheduled two exploration and development wells that can be drilled and logged prior to july   barring mechanical or other issues out of the company s control  such as permitting issues  weather or equipment availability 
the company believes that these wells together have the potential of adding reserves sufficient to remedy the borrowing base deficiency 
in addition  the company has identified certain properties which are not essential to its future growth and which it is in the process of marketing on a limited basis 
these include reserves of up to bcfe and production of approximately mmcfe d having an sec pv value of over million 
it is believed that a sale price of all or a sufficient portion of these properties can be achieved on or before july  further  the company is in discussions with third parties regarding the infusion of capital of up to million in the form of sub debt capital 
these discussions are subject to certain due diligence verification of the reserves  financial reported data and title examination as well as approval by the senior lenders 
the proceeds will be used to reduce the current indebtedness of the senior credit facility as well as capital expenditures for calendar year it is anticipated that the due diligence can be concluded on or before april  assuming positive results on both the due diligence and of the terms and conditions of the sub debt facility by the senior lenders  it is anticipated that this transaction could close on or before july  although there can be no assurances  management is confident that sufficient proceeds from the sale of non strategic oil and natural gas properties and new subordinated debt or similar financing arrangements will be generated in sufficient time to satisfy our funding obligations under both the credit agreement and the subordinated debt agreement to permit an orderly reduction and restructuring of our debt capital 
redeemable convertible preferred stock 
a private placement of million of redeemable convertible preferred stock was completed during may the preferred stock is convertible into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion price of per share 
dividends are payable semi annually in cash or additional preferred stock 
at the option of the company  one third of the preferred shares can be forced to convert to common stock if the closing price of the company s common stock exceeds of the conversion price for out of consecutive trading days on the new york stock exchange 
based on the above conversion criteria  the company can elect to convert up to one third of the original issue provided that the conversion occurs no sooner than twelve months from the most recent conversion 
the preferred stock is subject to redemption at the option of the company after march  and mandatory redemption on march  the holders of the preferred stock have been granted registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the preferred stock 
dividend payments of million were paid during the third quarter of dividends of million were accumulated during  of which million was paid in cash and million was satisfied with the issuance of additional shares of redeemable preferred stock 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in consisted of million for property and equipment additions primarily related to exploration and development of various prospects  including leases  seismic data acquisitions  and drilling and workover activities 
our strategy is to blend exploration drilling activities with high confidence workover and development projects selected from our broad asset inventory in order to capitalize on periods of high commodity prices 
this strategy brought on production and added reserves sooner than the drilling of deep  higher risk exploration wells 
the capital expenditures plan is currently forecast between and million 
the final projects will be determined based on a variety of factors  including prevailing prices for oil and natural gas  our expectations as to future pricing and the level of cash flow from operations 
we currently anticipate funding the plan primarily utilizing cash flow from operations 
where appropriate  excess cash flow from operations as a result of increased rates or prices beyond that needed for the capital expenditures plan we will use to de lever the company by development of exploration discoveries or direct payment of debt 
sale of properties 
on may   the company sold certain non strategic oil and gas properties located in south louisiana and the texas gulf coast for approximately million 
the sale was comprised of approximately bcfe proved developed reserves and bcfe of undeveloped reserves 
benefits of the sale include the reduction of total debt by an additional million resulting in an immediate savings in interest costs on the company s senior bank debt  the elimination of million in future capital expenditures associated with the properties  and the elimination of over million in annual lease operating expenses 
on december   we sold additional properties in south louisiana for approximately million 
cash obligations 
the following summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands less than after one year years years total short and long term debt    non cancelable operating leases     total contractual cash obligations     dividends 
it is our policy to retain existing cash for reinvestment in our business  and therefore  we do not anticipate that dividends will be paid with respect to the common stock in the foreseeable future 
dividends on the redeemable preferred stock aggregating million were accrued for in of that amount  million was paid in cash and million was satisfied with the issuance of additional shares of redeemable preferred stock 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operation are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally adopted in the united states 
the following summarizes several of our critical accounting policies 
see a complete list of significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the financial statements 
the company analyzes its estimates  including those related to oil and gas revenues  bad debts  oil and gas properties  marketable securities  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment 
the company follows the full cost method of accounting for its investments in oil and natural gas properties 
all costs incurred with the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties  including unproductive wells  are capitalized 
under the full cost method of accounting  such costs may be incurred both prior to or after the acquisition of a property and include lease acquisitions  geological and geophysical services  drilling  completion and equipment 
included in capitalized costs are general and administrative costs that are directly related with acquisition  exploration and development activities  and which are not related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
for the years   and  such capitalized costs totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
general and administrative costs related to production and general overhead are expensed as incurred 
proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas properties are credited to the full cost pool  except in transactions involving a significant quantity of reserves or where the proceeds received from the sale would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves  in which case a gain or loss would be recognized 
future development  site restoration  and dismantlement and abandonment costs  net of salvage values  are estimated property by property based upon current economic conditions and are included in our amortization of our oil and natural gas property costs 
the provision for depletion and amortization of oil and natural gas properties is computed by the unit of production method 
under this computation  the total unamortized costs of oil and natural gas properties including future development  site restoration  and dismantlement and abandonment costs  net of salvage value  excluding costs of unproved properties  are divided by the total estimated units of proved oil and natural gas reserves at the beginning of the period to determine the depletion rate 
this rate is multiplied by the physical units of oil and natural gas produced during the period 
the cost of unevaluated oil and natural gas properties not being amortized is assessed quarterly to determine whether such properties have been impaired 
in determining impairment  an evaluation is performed on current drilling results  lease expiration dates  current oil and gas industry conditions  and available geological and geophysical information 
any impairment assessed is added to the cost of proved properties being amortized 
full cost ceiling test 
at the end of each quarter  the unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties  net of related deferred income taxes  is limited to the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties using unhedged period end prices  discounted at  and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties adjusted for related income tax effects 
the calculation of the ceiling test and the provision for depletion and amortization is based on estimates of proved reserves 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting the future rates of production  timing  and plan of development 
the accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgement 
results of drilling  testing  and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify a revision of such estimate 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
during  a negative revision in oil and natural gas proved undeveloped reserves associated with the kent bayou field resulted in the company recognizing a full cost ceiling write down totaling million million after tax of its oil and natural gas properties 
a decline in oil and natural gas prices caused us to recognize million in full cost ceiling write downs during due to the inherent imprecision in estimating oil and natural gas revenues as well as the potential volatility in oil and gas prices and their effect on the carrying value of our proved oil and gas reserves  there can be no assurance that write downs in the future will not be required as a result of factors that may negatively affect the present value of proved oil and natural gas reserves and the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties  including volatile oil and natural gas prices  downward revisions in estimated proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities and unsuccessful drilling activities 
price risk management activities 
the company follows the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the statement also establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be reported in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
special hedge accounting for qualifying hedges allow the gains and losses on derivatives to offset related results on the hedged item in the earnings statements and would require that a company formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
we adopted fas effective january the company s results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and natural gas 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  the company has entered into various swap agreements 
these swaps allow the company to predict with greater certainty the effective oil and natural gas prices to be received for our hedged production 
although derivatives often fail to achieve effectiveness for accounting purposes  our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended 
these swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges as provided by fas and any changes in fair value of the cash flow hedge resulting from ineffectiveness of the hedge is reported in the consolidated statement of operation as revenues 
the estimated december   fair value of the company s oil and natural gas swaps is an unrealized loss of million million net of tax recognized in other comprehensive income 
based upon december   oil and natural gas commodity prices  approximately million of the loss deferred in other comprehensive income is expected to lower gross revenues over the next twelve months when the revenues are generated 
the swap agreements expire at various dates through july  payments under these swap agreements reduced oil and natural gas revenues by  for the year ended december  during the year ended december   the company had no material open hedging agreements 
during the year ended december   payments under swap agreements reduced oil and natural gas revenues by  see item a for additional discussion of disclosures about market risk 
fair value of financial instruments 
our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  bank borrowings and subordinated notes 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the highly liquid nature of these short term instruments 
the fair values of the bank borrowings approximate the carrying amounts as of december  and  and were determined based upon variable interest rates currently available to us for borrowings with similar terms 
based on quoted market prices as of the respective dates  the fair values of our subordinated notes due were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the carrying value of our subordinated notes was million at december  and forward looking information from time to time  we may make certain statements that contain forward looking information as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of and that involve risk and uncertainty 
these forward looking statements may include  but are not limited to exploration and seismic acquisition plans  anticipated results from current and future exploration prospects  future capital expenditure plans  anticipated results from third party disputes and litigation  expectations regarding compliance with our credit facility  the anticipated results of wells based on logging data and production tests  future sales of production  earnings  margins  production levels and costs  market trends in the oil and natural gas industry and the exploration and development sector thereof  environmental and other expenditures and various business trends 
forward looking statements may be made by management orally or in writing including  but not limited to  the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section and other sections of our filings with the securities and exchange commission under the securities act of  as amended  and the securities exchange act of  as amended 
actual results and trends in the future may differ materially depending on a variety of factors including  but not limited to the following changes in the price of oil and natural gas 
the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production and the level of such production are subject to wide fluctuations and depend on numerous factors that we do not control  including seasonality  worldwide economic conditions  the condition of the united states economy particularly the manufacturing sector  foreign imports  political conditions in other oil producing countries  the actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and domestic government regulation  legislation and policies 
material declines in the prices received for oil and natural gas could make the actual results differ from those reflected in our forward looking statements 
operating risks 
the occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the exploration for and the production of oil and natural gas  including uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas  brine or well fluids into the environment including groundwater and shoreline contamination  blowouts  cratering  mechanical difficulties  fires  explosions  unusual or unexpected formation pressures  pollution and environmental hazards  each of which could result in damage to or destruction of oil and natural gas wells  production facilities or other property  or injury to persons 
in addition  we are subject to other operating and production risks such as title problems  weather conditions  compliance with government permitting requirements  shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment  reductions in product prices  limitations in the market for products  litigation and disputes in the ordinary course of business 
although we maintain insurance coverage considered to be customary in the industry  we are not fully insured against certain of these risks either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs 
we cannot predict if or when any such risks could affect our operations 
the occurrence of a significant event for which we are not adequately insured could cause our actual results to differ from those reflected in our forward looking statements 
drilling risks 
our decision to purchase  explore  develop or otherwise exploit a prospect or property will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analysis  production data and engineering studies  which are inherently imprecise 
therefore  we cannot assure you that all of our drilling activities will be successful or that we will not drill uneconomical wells 
the occurrence of unexpected drilling results could cause the actual results to differ from those reflected in our forward looking statements 
uncertainties in estimating reserves and future net cash flows 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating the recovery from underground accumulations of oil and natural gas we cannot measure in an exact manner  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of those accumulations of data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgement 
reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and may be expected to change as additional information becomes available 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond our control 
because all reserve estimates are to some degree speculative  the quantities of oil and natural gas that we ultimately recover  production and operating costs  the amount and timing of future development expenditures and future oil and natural gas sales prices may differ from those assumed in these estimates 
significant downward revisions to our existing reserve estimates could cause the actual results to differ from those reflected in our forward looking statements 
borrowing base for the credit facility 
the credit agreement with societe generale and fortis capital corp 
is presently scheduled for borrowing base redetermination dates on a quarterly basis beginning april  the borrowing base is redetermined on numerous factors including current reserve estimates  reserves that have recently been added  current commodity prices  current production rates and estimated future net cash flows 
these factors have associated risks with each of them 
significant reductions or increases in the borrowing base will be determined by these factors  which  to a significant extent  are not under the company s control 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is from time to time exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and hedging contracts 
a discussion of the market risk exposure in financial instruments follows 
interest rates we are subject to interest rate risk on our long term fixed interest rate debt and variable interest rate borrowings 
our long term borrowings primarily consist of borrowings under the credit facility and principal due december  under our subordinated credit agreement 
since interest charged borrowings under the credit facility floats with prevailing interest rates except for the applicable interest period for eurodollar loans  the carrying value of borrowings under the credit facility should approximate the fair market value of such debt 
changes in interest rates  however  will change the cost of borrowing 
assuming million remains borrowed under the credit facility and million remains borrowed under the subordinated credit agreement  we estimate our annual interest expense will change by million for each basis point change in the applicable interest rates utilized under the credit facility and million from the subordinated credit agreement 
changes in interest rates would  assuming all other things being equal  cause the fair market value of debt with a fixed interest rate  such as the notes  to increase or decrease  and thus increase or decrease the amount required to refinance the debt 
the fair value of the notes is dependent on prevailing interest rates and our current stock price as it relates to the conversion price of per share of our common stock 
hedging contracts meridian may address market risk by selecting instruments whose value fluctuations correlate strongly with the underlying commodity being hedged 
from time to time  we may enter into swaps and other derivative contracts to hedge the price risks associated with a portion of anticipated future oil and gas production 
while the use of hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit future gains from favorable movements 
under these agreements  payments are received or made based on the differential between a fixed and a variable product price 
these agreements are settled in cash at or prior to expiration or exchanged for physical delivery contracts 
meridian does not obtain collateral to support the agreements  but monitors the financial viability of counter parties and believes its credit risk is minimal on these transactions 
in the event of nonperformance  we would be exposed to price risk 
meridian has some risk of accounting loss since the price received for the product at the actual physical delivery point may differ from the prevailing price at the delivery point required for settlement of the hedging transaction 
in  we entered into certain swap agreements as summarized in the table below 
the notional amount is equal to the total net volumetric hedge position of meridian during the periods indicated 
the positions effectively hedge approximately of our proved developed natural gas production and of our proved developed oil production 
the fair values of the hedges are based on the difference between the strike price and the new york mercantile exchange future prices for the applicable trading months 
weighted average fair value unrealized notional strike price at december  in amount per unit thousands natural gas mmbtu january june   oil bbls january july   glossary of certain oil and natural gas terms the definitions set forth below apply to the indicated terms commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry and in this form k 
mcfe is calculated using the ratio of six mcf of natural gas to one barrel of oil  condensate or natural gas liquids  which approximates the relative energy content of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids as compared to natural gas 
prices have historically been substantially higher for crude oil than natural gas on an energy equivalent basis
