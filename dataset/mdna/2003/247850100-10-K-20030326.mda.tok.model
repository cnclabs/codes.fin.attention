in  the domestic industry continued to suffer from an oversupply of lumber 
despite the highest level of housing starts in years and an increase in lumber consumption  greater domestic production combined with increased imports outpaced demand  and lumber prices declined to their lowest levels since although lumber prices declined in  deltic s average pine sawtimber price increased due to strong local markets and timing of sales 
improved operations at both sawmills enabled the mills segment to increase lumber production and reduce its operating loss in despite a lower average lumber price 
over the past three years  pine sawtimber prices have remained relatively stable while lumber prices have declined significantly  which was a significant factor in the company s sawmills operating at loss for the period

the preceding discussion of the company s liquidity and capital resources contains forward looking statements which were made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the private securities reform act of such statements reflect the company s current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those included in such forward looking statements 
other matters impact of inflation general inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s operating results during the three years ended december  the company s timber operations are more significantly impacted by the forces of supply and demand in the southern united states than by changes in inflation 
lumber manufacturing operations are affected by the supply of lumber available in the north american market and by the demand for lumber by both the north american and foreign export markets 
sales of real estate are affected by changes in the general economy and long term interest rates  specifically as such may manifest themselves in the central arkansas region 
market risk market risk represents the potential loss resulting from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments  either derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity security prices 
the company handles market risks in accordance with its established policies  however  deltic does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company does  on occasion  consider the need to enter into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in interest rates  however  the company entered into no such instruments during the three year period ended december  deltic held various financial instruments at december  and  consisting of financial assets and liabilities reported in the company s consolidated balance sheets and off balance sheet exposures resulting from contractual debt guarantees and letters of credit issued for the benefit of deltic  primarily in connection with its purchased stumpage procurement and real estate operations 
for additional information regarding these financial instruments  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents interest rate risk the company is subject to interest rate risk from the utilization of financial instruments  such as term debt and other borrowings 
the fair market value of long term  fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and will decrease as interest rates rise 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the instruments fair value  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
the estimated fair values of the company s funds held by trustee  long term debt  including current maturities  contractual guarantees of debt  and letters of credit at december   were 
million  million  million  and million  respectively 
a one percentage point increase in prevailing interest rates would result in decreases in the estimated fair value of long term debt of million and contractual guarantees of debt of 
million  while the fair value of the company s funds held by trustee and letters of credit would be unchanged 
initial fair values were determined using the current rates at which the company could enter into comparable financial instruments with similar remaining maturities 
the estimated pretax earnings and cash flows impact for resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates would be approximately 
million  holding other variables constant 
foreign exchange rate risk the company currently has no exposure to foreign exchange rate risk because all of its financial instruments are denominated in us dollars 
commodity price risk the company has no financial instruments subject to commodity price risk 
equity security price risk none of the company s financial instruments have potential exposure to equity security price risk 
the preceding discussion of the company s estimated fair value of its financial instruments and the sensitivity analyses resulting from hypothetical changes in interest rates are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements reflect the company s current expectations and involve uncertainties 
these forward looking market risk disclosures are selective in nature and only address the potential impact from financial instruments 
they do not include other potential effects which could impact deltic s business as a result of changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  or equity security prices 
critical accounting policies the company has identified nine of its current accounting policies as being  in management s view  critical to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  in addition to requiring significant judgement on the part of management as it pertains to certain factors inherent in the policies 
these policies  along with explanations of the key factors identified and considered by management  are described below 
for a listing of all significant accounting policies of the company  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventories of logs  lumber  and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or market net realizable value  primarily using the average cost method 
log costs include harvest and transportation cost as appropriate 
lumber costs include materials  labor  and production overhead 
determination of the net realizable value of each component of lumber inventory requires estimation of the expected future selling price for each item in inventory held for sale 
for this  management utilizes a pricing schedule  based on the random lengths lumber report  which is prepared weekly for its sales personnel 
for in process lumber inventories at the company s manufacturing facilities  this also requires estimation of the future cost per unit to complete manufacturing from each stage of processing  using historical manufacturing costs 
this estimation process can affect the asset carrying value for inventories  and any required inventory 
table of contents write down would affect both current and future periods results of operations 
for additional information about the company s inventories  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
investment in real estate held for development and sale real estate held for development and sale is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value  and includes direct costs of land and land development and indirect costs  including amenities 
these costs are allocated to individual lots or acreage sold based on relative sales value 
direct costs are allocated on a specific neighborhood basis  while indirect costs for the company s three developments chenal valley  chenal downs  and red oak ridge are allocated to neighborhoods over the entire respective development area 
the key factors involved in determining the investment in real estate held for development and sale are the treatment of the clubhouse and golf course at chenal country club  the amenity around which the chenal valley development is centered  as an amenity rather than an operating fixed asset and the management estimates required to estimate the future indirect development costs and sales values of the areas of chenal valley yet to be developed 
due to accounting for chenal country club as an amenity  the cost of the clubhouse and golf course  including the estimated cost of planned future improvements  are charged against income as real estate is sold rather than depreciating this cost 
this amenity treatment also records the initiation fees received from members joining the club as a reduction in the cost basis of the club rather than as net sales 
in addition  the company s model for allocating the indirect cost to be expensed against each piece of real estate sold requires management to estimate the future indirect costs to be incurred for the entire development  primarily infrastructure costs and future improvements at chenal country club net of estimated future initiation fees to be received  as well as the potential market value of each tract of undeveloped property within the chenal valley development 
in determining future indirect development costs  management relies on cost projections for its development plans provided by independent  professional engineering consultants

investment in del tin fiber investment in del tin fiber  a percent owned limited liability company  is carried at cost and is being adjusted for the company s proportionate share of its undistributed earnings or losses 
the company s equity method basis carrying value for its investment in del tin fiber is evaluated for possible impairment  as required under the requirements of accounting principles board opinion apb this evaluation resulted in a determination that the company s investment was impaired as of december   and the carrying amount of the investment was written off  to zero  for the consolidated balance sheet 
for deltic s investment in del tin fiber  the key determinations by management are the accounting treatment for this investment under the equity method of accounting rather than as a consolidated subsidiary since the joint venture is percent owned by both owners and the factors used in evaluating the impairment of its investment s carrying value 
deltic management has determined that there is no control by either company due to having a board of managers with equal representation 
as such  the assets and liabilities of del tin fiber are not included in the amounts reported on the company s balance sheet for any period 
in evaluating the possibility of the existence of an impairment for the company s carrying value for its investment in del tin fiber under apb  management must estimate future net cash flows from the possible courses of action available for its investment  such as continuing to maintain or sell its investment  to determine both recoverability of the carrying amount and fair value of the investment 
as such  management must determine the possible courses of action and estimate the probability of each potential action  as well as the related future net cash flows 
then  if estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount  management must determine if this impairment is other than temporary 
if so  then an impairment write down is required

table of contents timber and timberlands timber and timberlands  which includes purchased stumpage inventory and logging facilities  is stated at acquisition cost less cost of fee timber harvested and accumulated depreciation of logging facilities 
the cost of fee timber harvested is based on the volume of timber harvested in relation to the estimated volume of timber recoverable 
logging facilities  which consist primarily of roads constructed and other land improvements  are depreciated using the straight line method over a ten year estimated life 
the company estimates its fee timber inventory using statistical information and data obtained from physical measurements and other information gathering techniques 
the cost of timber and timberland purchased and reforestation costs are capitalized 
fee timber carrying costs are expensed as incurred 
the key components of the timber and timberlands policy are management s decision to maintain separate timber cost pools for each legal entity within the deltic consolidated group and the required estimation of timber inventory volume  by species  for each of these companies in order to calculate the cost of fee timber harvested per ton 
management has elected to maintain a separate cost pool for the timber owned by each company  thus resulting in a different cost per ton for fee timber harvested for each 
the mix of harvest by company for any period can significantly affect the amount of cost of fee timber harvested expense reported per ton costs ranged from to per ton for pine sawtimber 
in determining these rates  management must estimate the volume of timber existing on its timberlands 
to estimate these fee timber inventories  the company relies on its experienced forestry personnel and their use of statistical information and data obtained by actual physical measurements and other information gathering techniques 
the cost of fee timber harvested recognized is impacted by the accuracy of this volume estimation

property  plant  and equipment property  plant  and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation of buildings  equipment  and other depreciable assets is primarily determined using the straight line method 
expenditures that substantially improve and or increase the useful life of facilities or equipment are capitalized 
maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred 
gains and losses on disposals or retirements are included in income as they occur 
property  plant  and equipment assets are evaluated for possible impairment on a specific asset basis or in groups of similar assets  as applicable  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and depreciation ceases 
the key factors for the property  plant  and equipment policy are the estimation of the useful lives of the company s various asset types  the election to primarily utilize the straight line method for recording depreciation  management s judgement regarding appropriate capitalization or expensing of costs related to fixed assets  and management s determination regarding impairment of any company asset or group of assets 
the estimation of useful lives for fixed assets impacts the level of annual depreciation expense recorded 
utilization of the straight line method for recording depreciation or any of the other acceptable methods for depreciating assets results in the same amount of depreciation over the life of an asset  however  the amount of annual depreciation expense and the resulting carrying amount of net property  plant  and equipment will vary significantly depending on the method elected 
management feels that the straight line method results in the most accurate recognition of periodic depreciation expense for the majority of the company s assets 
management s evaluation of whether an expenditure related to property  plant  
table of contents and equipment substantially improves and or increases the useful life of an asset and is appropriately capitalized as an addition to the asset s cost basis or is expensed as normal maintenance and repair expense also can significantly affect results of operations for a given period  as well as the company s financial position 
management has also evaluated any asset or group of assets for which potential impairment might exist and has determined that there are none requiring an impairment write down 
this process requires management s estimate of future cash flows generated by each asset or group of assets 
for any instance where this evaluation process might indicate an impairment exists  the appropriate asset s carrying values would be written down to fair value and the amount of the write down would be charged against the results of continuing operations 
for additional information about the company s property  plant  and equipment  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of lumber and wood by products is recorded at the time of shipment

revenue from intersegment timber sales is recorded when the timber is harvested  such intersegment sales  which are generally made at prices that approximate market  are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
revenue from timberland and real estate sales is recorded when the sale is closed and legal title is transferred  which is generally at the time the purchaser executes the real estate sale closing documents and makes payment to the title company handling the closing 
income taxes the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  the provision for income taxes includes amounts currently payable and amounts deferred as tax assets and liabilities  based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities  and is measured using the enacted tax rates that are assumed will be in effect when the differences reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance which is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the key management decisions related to income taxes are the determination of current taxability of transactions  the election to capitalize or expense costs incurred  the decision regarding the appropriate depreciation method for income tax purposes these three factors ultimately affect the company s cash flows for income taxes paid and determine the differences between the financial statements carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities  and management s estimation of the appropriateness of valuation allowances to reduce any deferred tax assets that exist 
the company s management also decided during to elect to file consolidated state tax returns  effective with the filing of the returns  which had the effect of reduced state tax liability for the company 
deltic s management periodically evaluates the company s ability to realize future benefit of deferred tax assets by reviewing the expected turnaround of deferred tax liabilities and the amount of future taxable income and by evaluating tax planning strategies that could possibly be implemented to realize deferred tax assets

stock based compensation at december   deltic had a stock based compensation plan for which the company applies the recognition and measurement principles of apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for those plans 
stock based employee compensation expense is accrued for the intrinsic value  if any  of stock options or restricted stock granted over the applicable vesting periods using the straight line method 
options granted by the company have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
as of november  the company eliminated 
table of contents certain option exercise procedures  resulting in a change to fixed plan accounting treatment for all options outstanding 
prior to that date  the company was required to apply variable plan accounting standards which required adjustment of the cost of options granted for changes in the market value per share of the company s common stock 
the effect on net income loss and earnings per share if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  for the years ended december consisted of the following thousands of dollars  except per share amounts net income loss  as reported plus total stock based compensation expense determined under the intrinsic value method for awards  net of related tax effects  included in the determination of net income less pro forma total stock based compensation expense determined under the fair value method for all awards  net of related tax effects pro forma net income loss basic earnings per share as reported pro forma dilutive earnings per share as reported pro forma for the pro forma net income calculation in the preceding table  the fair value of each option on the date of grant was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions for awards in   and  respectively dividend yields of percent  percent  and 
percent  expected volatility of percent  percent  and percent  risk free interest rates of percent  percent  and percent  and expected lives of five years 
using these assumptions  the weighted average grant date fair value per share of options granted in   and was   and  respectively 
the key management decision factors for stock based compensation are the decision to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles of apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  or the fair value recognition and measurement principles of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas  accounting for stocked based compensation transition and disclosure  and the determination of the exercise price for options granted 
currently  a company s management can elect to adopt sfas or continue to use apb for recognizing stock option expense in its financial statements 
if continued use of apb is elected  the income statement will generally reflect a lesser amount for stock based compensation expense  and the potential impact of adopting sfas and sfas will only be disclosed on a pro forma basis in the financial statement footnotes 
under the company s stock incentive plan  option exercise price for options granted is equal to the fair market per share stock price on the date of the grant  which should result in no stock based compensation expense for future options granted under the company s stock incentive plan 

table of contents however  options granted in february were subject to shareholder approval at the company s annual stockholders meeting on april   the accounting measurement date for these options 
as a result  these options had an intrinsic value of per share due to an increase in the market price of the company s common stock between february and april  and the resulting stock based compensation expense is being recognized over the vesting periods of these options

the key decisions for management related to pensions and other postretirement benefits are the plans assumptions for weighted average discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase  and the assumed health care inflation rate 
in determining these assumptions  management utilizes outside advisors and the results of industry compensation surveys

despite a strong housing market  lumber supply continues to outpace demand due to overproduction in north america and increased imports from overseas  resulting in weak lumber prices 
the implementation of duties on canadian lumber imports in may exacerbated the imbalance  as a number of canadian producers responded by increasing production 
the situation may improve in the near term as the industry enters the spring building season 
however  any sustained recovery in the lumber market is dependent upon a reduction in supply or a satisfactory resolution of the canadian trade issue 
although the regional market for pine sawtimber has remained relatively stable during this period of weak lumber prices  sawtimber prices could decline slightly in if the lumber market does not improve 
demand for the company s residential lots continues to be strong and is expected to remain so as long as interest rates stay at or near current levels
