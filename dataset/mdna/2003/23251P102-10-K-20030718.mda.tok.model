this discussion contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about us and our industry 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  as more fully described under the heading factors affecting future operating results and in the business section and elsewhere in this form k 
cyberonics undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
summary we were founded in to design  develop and bring to market medical devices which provide a unique therapy  vagus nerve stimulation  for the treatment of epilepsy and other debilitating neurological  psychiatric diseases and other disorders 
clinical trials of the vns therapy system began with the first patient implant in november under ide from fda 
we received fda approval to market the vns therapy system in the us in july for use as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures in adults and adolescents over years of age with partial onset seizures that are refractory or resistant to antiepileptic drugs 
we were granted regulatory approval in to market and sell the vns therapy system in the member countries of the european union and we also have permission to sell in certain other international markets with the broader indication of refractory epilepsy and without discrimination to patient age 
in march  the vns therapy system was approved by nv kema  an official notified body representing the european union countries  for the treatment of chronic or recurrent depression in patients that are in a treatment resistant or treatment intolerant major depressive episode 
this ce mark approval  by definition includes the treatment of depression in patients with major depressive disorder  or so called unipolar depression  as well as patients with bipolar disorder  or manic depression 
in april  the vns therapy system was approved by health canada for the treatment of chronic or recurrent depression in patients that are in a treatment resistant or treatment intolerant major depressive episode 
the canadian approval is similar to ce mark european approval in that patients with unipolar depression and bipolar depression are included 
although vns therapy using the vns therapy system has been approved in european union countries and canada for the treatment of chronic or recurrent depression  we do not anticipate significant sales volumes in these countries until reimbursement approvals have been received in each country and we have received regulatory approval in the us from inception through july  our primary focus was on obtaining fda approval for the vns therapy system for the treatment of epilepsy 
since inception  we have incurred substantial expenses  primarily for research and development activities which include product and process development and clinical trials and related regulatory activities  sales and marketing activities  manufacturing start up costs and system infrastructure 
we have also made significant investments in recent periods in connection with the us market launch of the vns therapy system and the clinical research costs associated with new indications development  most notably depression 
for the period from inception through april   we incurred a cumulative net deficit of approximately million 
the clinical studies for depression are for investigational therapies that are not expected to generate significant sales prior to fda approval  which is not anticipated before calendar  if at all 
furthermore  the timing and nature of these expenditures are contingent upon several factors outside of our control and may exceed the current expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in march  we elected to change our fiscal year from june to a week year ending on the last friday in april of each year  effective april  accordingly  fiscal started april  and ended april   fiscal started april  and ended april  and fiscal started july  and ended april  the company s future success is dependent upon a number of factors which include  among others  achieving market acceptance and generating sufficient sales volume  obtaining and maintaining regulatory and reimbursement approvals for our products  the possibility of competition and technological changes  developing our sales  marketing and corporate infrastructures  maintaining an uninterrupted supply of certain sole source components and materials  adding sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet future possible product demand  possible product liability or recall  and reliance on key personnel 
critical accounting policies the company considers the following accounting policies as the most critical because  in management s view  they are most important to the portrayal of the company s consolidated financial condition and results and most demanding in terms of requirements and other exercises of judgment 
accounts receivable 
the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon specific customer risks and a general provision based upon historical trends 
an increase in losses beyond that expected by management or that historically experienced by the company would reduce earnings when they become known 
inventories 
cyberonics states its inventories at the lower of cost  first in  first out fifo method  or market 
cost includes the acquisition cost of raw materials and components  direct labor and overhead 
management considers potential obsolescence at each balance sheet date 
an acceleration of obsolescence could occur if consumer demand should differ from expectations 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are carried at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
maintenance  repairs and minor replacements are charged to expense as incurred  significant renewals and betterments are capitalized 
for financial reporting purposes  the company computes depreciation using the straight line method over useful lives ranging from two to nine years 
an unanticipated change in the utilization or expected useful life of property and equipment could result in an acceleration in the timing of the expenses 
fair value of financial instruments 
the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and line of credit approximate their fair values due to the short term maturity of these financial instruments 
revenue recognition 
revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon shipment to the customer  net of estimated returns and allowances 
the company s revenues are dependent upon sales to new and existing customers pursuant to the company s policy 
a change in this policy or sales terms could impact the amount and timing of revenue recognized 
research and development 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
the company has entered into contractual obligations for the conduct of clinical studies 
costs are incurred primarily at the time of enrollment and paid under the terms of the contracts 
research and development expenses could vary significantly with changes in the timing of clinical activity 
warranty expense 
the company provides at the time of shipment for costs estimated to be incurred under its product warranties 
provisions for warranty expenses are made based upon projected product warranties 
amounts actually paid could vary subject to certain factors discussed in factors affecting future operating results discussed below 
stock options 
the company has adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which disclosures are presented in note  summary of significant accounting policies and related data stock options 
because of this election  the company continues to account for its employee stock based compensation plans under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
and the related interpretations 
no stock based compensation cost is reflected in net income for employee option grants for options granted under those plans having an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
income taxes 
cyberonics accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between financial accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
such differences relate primarily to the company s election to defer the deduction of certain start up costs for federal income tax purposes  the deductibility of certain accruals and reserves and the effect of tax loss and tax credit carryforwards not yet utilized 
deferred tax assets are evaluated for realization based on a more likely than not criteria in determining if a valuation allowance should be provided 
results of operations net sales 
net sales for the weeks ended april  totaled million  compared to net sales of million for the weeks ended april  and million for the weeks ended april  net sales of million for fiscal increased over fiscal by due to increases in unit sales and increases in average selling prices 
net sales of million for fiscal increased over fiscal by due to increases in unit sales and increases in average selling prices 
us net sales for the weeks ended april  were million  compared to million and million for the weeks ended april  and april   respectively 
international sales for the weeks ended april  were million compared to million and million for the weeks ended april  and april   respectively 
future increases in net sales will depend upon increased market acceptance for the vns therapy system and upon expanding our reimbursement from third party payers 
we cannot assure you that sales levels in subsequent periods will increase at the rates experienced in recent periods or at all 
gross profit 
cost of sales consist primarily of direct labor  allocated manufacturing overhead  third party contractor costs  royalties  and the acquisition cost of raw materials and components 
gross margin was for the weeks ended april   as compared to and for the weeks ended april  and april   respectively 
the increase in gross margin in fiscal and fiscal is the result of increases in average selling prices and improvement in manufacturing production efficiencies 
we are obligated to pay royalties at a rate of of net sales in future periods 
gross margins can be expected to fluctuate in future periods based upon the mix between us and international sales  direct and distributor sales  the vns therapy system selling price  applicable royalty rates  and the levels of production volume 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million or of net sales for the weeks ended april   as compared to million or of net sales for the weeks ended april  and million or of net sales for the weeks ended april  the increase of in fiscal year expenses over the prior year reflects additional expenses required to support sales volume growth of approximately 
the increase of in fiscal expenses over the prior year is primarily due to the additional marketing programs implemented to expand awareness and acceptance of vns therapy  increased participation in industry marketing events and increased administrative staffing levels to support the growth of the organization 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses are comprised of expenses related to our product and process development  product design efforts  clinical trials programs and regulatory activities 
research and development expenses were million  or of net sales for the weeks ended april   compared to million  or of net sales for the weeks ended april  and million  or of net sales for the weeks ended april  the decrease of million  or in fiscal over the prior year is due to reduced spending in new indications development  primarily in the depression pivotal study costs which were significantly lower in fiscal as the clinical program progressed into the long term  lower cost phase of the d study 
the increase of million or in fiscal over the prior year is due to the additional costs associated with the enrollment and acute phase of the depression pivotal study and other new indication pilot studies and expanded regulatory activities 
non recurring charges 
non recurring charges were million for the weeks ended april  on september   medtronic  inc medtronic publicly announced a proposal to acquire the company for per share in value of medtronic common stock 
the company s board of directors  with the assistance of morgan stanley dean witter  the company s financial advisor  elected to remain independent to pursue its patent protected business opportunities 
on september   medtronic announced that it had withdrawn its offer 
the company incurred non recurring charges of million which includes investment banking fees to morgan stanley dean witter of million 
the company also incurred legal  accounting and consulting fees of approximately  and other related costs of  interest income 
interest income was  during the weeks ended april   compared to  for the weeks ended april  and  for the weeks ended april  interest income declined in fiscal due to lower average interest rates and lower average cash balances on hand throughout the year 
interest expense 
interest expense was  for the weeks ended april   as compared to  for the weeks ended april  and  for the weeks ended april  interest expense has increased due to the expanded use of a million credit facility established in september and includes interest expense on capital leases for manufacturing equipment which bears interest at over a term of five years 
the credit facility was increased to million in april and bears interest at the designated bank rate plus on the greater of  or the average of net balances owed by the company at the close of each day during the month 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  was  for the weeks ended april   compared to  during the weeks ended april  and  for the weeks ended april  in all reported periods  other income expense consisted primarily of net gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency transactions and rates 
we expect other income expense to fluctuate in future periods depending upon fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
income taxes 
at april   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
the following is a reconciliation of statutory federal income tax rates to the company s effective income tax rate expressed as a percentage of income from operations before income taxes weeks ended weeks ended months ended april  april  april  provision for income taxes  us statutory us increase in deferred tax valuation allowance state local tax provision other  net liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private placements of our securities 
in february  we raised approximately million from the sale of common stock in a private offering 
in september  we established a revolving credit facility for  with a term of three years 
this credit facility was expanded to  in april and it is collateralized by accounts receivable  inventory  equipment  documents of title  general intangibles  subsidiary stock and other collateral 
borrowings against the facility are based upon eligible accounts receivable 
the net available borrowing base at april  was  interest is payable at the amount of the designated bank rate of as of april  plus totaling on the greater of  or the average of the net balance owed by the company at the close of each day during the period 
under the modified terms of the revolving credit facility  we agreed to maintain liquidity being the aggregate of availability under the credit facility and cash equal to or greater than  an unused line of credit fee is payable at the rate of 
as of april   we had  in borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
during fiscal  cash on hand increased by  to  net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was  compared to net cash used in operating activities in fiscal of  the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of the improved earnings performance in fiscal  as net earnings increased by  over prior year  resulting in net income of  for the year ended april  in addition  we received approximately  in fiscal in connection with the issuance of shares pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans and  in proceeds from the revolving credit facility 
cash proceeds during the period were primarily used to fund working capital and capital expenditures 
during fiscal  cash on hand decreased by  to  net cash used in operating activities was approximately  compared to net cash used in operating activities in the prior year of  the increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to increases in working capital supporting the growth of the company 
in fiscal  we received  in proceeds from the revolving line of credit and  in connection with the issuance of shares pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
cash proceeds during the period were primarily used to fund working capital and capital expenditures 
during the months ended april   cash on hand increased by  to  net cash used in operating activities in fiscal was  we raised approximately  from the sale of common stock in a private equity offering 
in addition  we received approximately  in connection with the issuance of shares pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
cash proceeds during the period were primarily used to fund working capital and capital expenditures 
we are a party to a number of contracts pursuant to which we are paying for clinical studies for which current operating obligations payable totaled million as of april  although we have no firm commitments  we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal  primarily to expand manufacturing capabilities  and to enhance business infrastructure and facilities 
our current projections indicate that we have sufficient funds and cash flow resources to fund anticipated business activities through fiscal without additional financing 
our cash flow could  however  be adversely effected by the factors affecting future operating results discussed below 
we would consider reasonably priced additional financing which would provide funding for new indications development and unplanned or expanded clinical studies 
financing through debt or equity instruments may be available  although the availability of such financing will depend upon a number of important factors  including the strength of the us capital markets and economy  the health care and medical device segments in particular and the status of our business activities  including epilepsy sales growth and clinical and regulatory activities

factors affecting future operating results in addition to the factors described above in this section and in the section of this annual report on form k entitled business  the following additional factors could affect our future results 
our common stock price constantly changes 
a public market for our common stock has existed since our common stock is now traded on the nasdaq national market under the ticker symbol cybx 
the price of stock on that trading market fluctuates  and we expect that the market price of common stock will continue to fluctuate 
for instance  during the fiscal year ended april   our stock has traded from a low of to a high of per share 
the fluctuation in our stock price is caused by a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including quarterly variations in our sales and operating results  results of studies regarding the efficacy of our vns therapy treatment for other indications including depression  ad  anxiety and other disorders  announcements of significant contracts  acquisitions  or capital commitments  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  changes in market valuations of medical device companies  additions or departures of key personnel  sales of common stock by the company  its officers and members of its board of directors  and changes in the general conditions of the economy 
in addition  the stock market in recent years has experienced broad price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies 
these broad market fluctuations have also adversely affected  and may continue to adversely affect  the market price of our common stock 
we rely on only one product for our revenues and if sales of this product are not achieved  our operating results will be severely harmed 
we have only one product  the vns therapy system  which has been approved by fda for a single indication as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures in adults and adolescents over years of age with partial onset seizures that are refractory to antiepileptic drugs 
we do not expect to have any other product or approved indication for the vns therapy system in the us before calendar  if at all 
although sales of the vns therapy system have been increasing  we cannot assure you that sales will continue to increase at the same rate or at all 
we do not yet have the regulatory or reimbursement approvals necessary to commercialize the vns therapy system for the treatment of depression 
we cannot assure you that any approvals for the treatment of depression with the vns therapy system will be granted  nor can we assure you that even if the approval is granted  we will be successful in commercializing the vns therapy system for the treatment of depression 
the same uncertainty surrounds our efforts in anxiety disorders  ad applications and obesity 
our inability to commercialize successfully the vns therapy system for depression  obesity and other indications will severely harm our future growth 
we may not be able to continue to expand market acceptance of the use of the vns therapy system to treat epilepsy  which could cause our sales to decrease 
continued market acceptance of the vns therapy system will depend on our ability to convince the medical community of the clinical efficacy and safety of vagus nerve stimulation and the vns therapy system 
while the vns therapy system has been used in approximately  patients through june   many physicians are still unfamiliar with this form of therapy 
we believe that existing antiepileptic drugs and surgery are the only other approved and currently available therapies competitive with the vns therapy system in the treatment of epileptic seizures 
these therapies may be more attractive to patients or their physicians than the vns therapy system in terms of efficacy  cost or reimbursement availability 
we cannot assure you that the vns therapy system will continue to achieve expanded market acceptance for the treatment of epilepsy or for any other indication 
failure of the vns therapy system to gain additional market acceptance would severely harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be successful in our marketing and sales efforts  which could severely harm our business 
the realignment and reorganization of the us sales force implemented in may resulted in hiring several new sales representatives and regional managers  who will require training and time on the job to become effective 
this reorganization also created changes in geography  physician audience or job roles for a substantial portion of the tenured sales force 
while we believe these changes should ultimately improve productivity and performance going forward  we cannot assure you that those outcomes will be achieved 
the disruption caused by territory realignment and expansion could take longer than expected to yield improvements in productivity and efficiency 
the time necessary for personnel to establish new territories and relationships of trust with new physicians may take longer than projected  which could substantially delay improvements in us sales performance or jeopardize attainment of quarterly revenue goals 
our inability to achieve annual revenue growth or achieve our quarterly revenue targets could substantially harm our results of operations and financial condition 
patient confidentiality and regulations such as the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa of may limit our ability to secure a third party payment for our patients and impact our patient pull through selling model 
hipaa regulations are required to be fully implemented for all health care providers by april  under the hipaa privacy rule  the privacy of all medical records  billing records  and other identified health information protected health information or phi must be protected 
such regulations may hinder our ability to utilize our patient identification and qualification piq process as well as our vns patient outcomes registry registry  both of which are key elements of our patient pull through sales mode 
the discontinuation of our piq and registry processes could severely limit our ability to market and sell vns therapy under our existing sales model and could harm our business growth and financial condition 
we may be unable to maintain adequate third party reimbursement on our product 
our ability to commercialize the vns therapy system successfully depends in part on whether third party payers  including private health care insurers  managed care plans  the us government s medicare and medicaid programs and others  agree both to cover the vns therapy system and associated procedures and services and to reimburse at adequate levels for the costs of the vns therapy system and the related services we have in the us or internationally 
if we fail to maintain favorable coverage decisions for the vns therapy system in a timely manner  patients and their physicians could be deterred from using the vns therapy system which could reduce our sales and severely harm our business 
our current and future expense estimates are based  in large part  on estimates of future sales  which are difficult to predict 
we may be unable to  or may elect not to  adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected sales shortfall 
if increased expenses are not accompanied by increased sales  our results of operations and financial condition for any particular quarter could be harmed 
if our suppliers and manufacturers are unable to meet our demand for materials  components and contract services  we may be forced to qualify new vendors or change our product design which would impair our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis 
we rely upon sole source suppliers for certain of the key components  materials and contract services used in manufacturing the vns therapy system 
we periodically experience discontinuation or unavailability of components  materials and contract services which may require us to qualify alternative sources or  if no such alternative sources are identified  change our product design 
we believe that pursuing and qualifying alternative sources and or redesigning specific components of the vns therapy system if or  when necessary  could consume significant resources 
in addition  such changes generally require regulatory submissions and approvals 
any extended delays in or an inability to secure alternative sources for these or other components  materials and contract services could result in product supply and manufacturing interruptions  which could significantly harm our business 
our products may be found to have defects and result in product recalls 
the vns therapy system includes a complex electronic generator device and lead device designed to be implanted in the human body 
component failures  manufacturing or shipping problems or design defects could result in the product not delivering the therapy for which it is indicated 
the occurrence of such problems or other adverse clinical reactions could result in a recall of our products  possibly requiring explantation and potential reimplantation of the vns therapy system which may increase risk to the patient 
any product recall could severely harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use  which could diminish the value of our products and impair our ability to compete 
our success depends upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection for the vns therapy system and its improvements  and for vagus nerve stimulation therapy 
to that end  we have acquired licenses under certain patents and have patented and intend to continue to seek patents on our own inventions used in our products and treatment methods 
the process of seeking patent protection can be expensive and time consuming and we cannot assure you that patents will issue from our currently pending or future applications or that  if patents are issued  they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection of our technology  or any commercial advantage to us 
further  the protection offered by the licensed international patents is not as strong as that offered by the licensed us patents due to differences in patent laws 
in particular  the european patent convention prohibits patents covering methods for treatment of the human body by surgery or therapy 
we may have to engage in litigation to protect our proprietary rights  or defend against infringement claims by third parties  causing us to suffer significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us  may be necessary to enforce patents issued or licensed to us  to protect trade secrets or know how owned by us or to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  could require us to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent us from manufacturing  selling or using the vns therapy system  any of which could severely harm our business 
intense competition and rapid technological changes could reduce our ability to market our products and achieve sales 
we believe that existing and future antiepileptic drugs will continue to be the primary competition for the vns therapy system 
we may also face competition from other medical device companies that have the technology  experience and capital resources to develop alternative devices for the treatment of epilepsy 
medtronic  inc  for example  continues to clinically assess an implantable signal generator used with an invasive deep brain probe  or thalamic stimulator  for the treatment of neurological disorders and has received fda approval for the device for the treatment of essential tremor  including that associated with parkinson s disease 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  marketing and technical resources than we do and have obtained third party reimbursement approvals for their therapies 
in addition  the health care industry is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress 
our competitors may develop technologies and obtain regulatory approval for products that are more effective in treating epilepsy than our current or future products 
in addition  advancements in surgical techniques may make surgery a more attractive therapy for epilepsy 
the development by others of new treatment methods with novel antiepileptic drugs  medical devices or surgical techniques for epilepsy could render the vns therapy system non competitive or obsolete 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  including new products and technology  which could severely harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are subject to claims of product liability and we may not have the resources or insurance to cover the cost for losses under these claims 
as an implantable medical device  the manufacture and sale of the vns therapy system entails the risk of product liability claims 
our product liability coverage may not be adequate to cover any of these claims 
product liability insurance is expensive and in the future may only be available at significantly higher premiums or not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage could significantly harm our business and financial condition 
if we do not continue to comply with changing government regulations  we could lose our ability to market and sell our product 
the preclinical and clinical testing  manufacturing  labeling  sale  distribution and promotion of the vns therapy system are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation in the us by federal agencies  primarily fda  and by comparable state agencies 
in the future  it will be necessary for us to obtain additional government approvals for other applications of the vns therapy system and for modified or future generation products 
commercial distribution in certain foreign countries is also subject to obtaining regulatory approvals from the appropriate authorities in such countries 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
moreover  regulatory approvals may include regulatory restrictions on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in  among other things  fines  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  confiscations or recalls of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution 
furthermore  changes in existing regulations or adoption of new regulations could prevent us from obtaining  or affect the timing of  future regulatory approvals 
we may not be able to obtain additional future regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all 
delays in receipt of or failure to receive such future approvals  suspension or withdrawal of previously received approvals  or recalls of the vns therapy system could severely harm our ability to market and sell our current and future products and improvements 
our international operations are subject to risks not generally associated with commercialization efforts in the us we may not be successful in increasing our international market sales or in obtaining reimbursement or any regulatory approvals required in foreign countries 
the anticipated international nature of our business is also expected to subject us and our representatives  agents and distributors to laws and regulations of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate or where the vns therapy system is sold 
the regulation of medical devices in a number of such jurisdictions  particularly in the european union  continues to develop and new laws or regulations may impair our ability to market and sell our products in those jurisdictions 
if we fail to effectively manage our growth  our ability to maintain our costs or capture new business could suffer 
in connection with the commercialization of the vns therapy system in the us  we have begun and intend to continue to significantly expand the scope of our operations  in particular in manufacturing and in marketing and sales 
such activities have placed  and may continue to place  a significant strain on our resources and operations 
our ability to effectively manage such growth will depend upon our ability to attract  hire and retain highly qualified employees and management personnel 
we compete for such personnel with other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations and we may not be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel 
our success will also depend upon the ability of our officers and key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational  management information and financial control systems 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our business would suffer 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future  which may cause our stock price to decline 
our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and may be below the expectations of security analysts 
if so  the market price of our shares may decline 
our quarterly revenues  expenses and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter for several reasons including the extent to which the vns therapy system gains market acceptance  the timing of obtaining marketing approvals for the vns therapy system for other indications  the timing of any approvals for reimbursement by third party payers  the rate and size of expenditures incurred as we expand our clinical  manufacturing  sales and marketing efforts  our ability to retain qualified sales personnel and the availability of key components  materials and contract services  which may depend on our ability to forecast sales 
we may not be successful in our efforts to develop vns therapy for the treatment of depression  ad  anxiety  obesity  or any other indications 
we are in the process of conducting studies to help us evaluate  and potentially obtain fda approval  for the use of vns therapy as a treatment for depression  ad  anxiety and other neurological disorders 
we cannot assure you that our test results will be positive or that we will receive fda approval for the use of our product for the treatment of any other indication 
even if we receive fda approval for another indication  we can provide no assurances with respect to market acceptance 
if our test results are not as we anticipate  if we receive no additional fda approvals or if alternative indications do not prove to be commercially viable  our revenues may not experience the growth that we would anticipate with the successful development of any of these indications 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investments in us government obligations  our line of credit and our fixed rate long term debt 
we do not hedge interest rate exposure or invest in derivative securities 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our wholly owned foreign subsidiary is consolidated into our financial results 
our reported revenues  expenses and cash flows from this subsidiary are exposed to changing exchange rates 
at this time  we have not deemed it to be cost effective to engage in a program of hedging the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our operating results using derivative financial instruments
