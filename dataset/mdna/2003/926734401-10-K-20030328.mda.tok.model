acquisition of epicentric  inc in december  we acquired all issued and outstanding shares of epicentric  inc epicentric for million in cash  including million in transaction costs 
epicentric was a leading provider of business portal solutions 
by adding advanced portal and delivery management capabilities to our existing and future product suites  we have the capability to deliver real time enterprise web applications 
in addition to the purchase price  we expect to pay million  in cash and restricted stock  in acquisition related employee retention payments over the next two years 
this acquisition did not result in an additional segment 
impairment of goodwill as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test performed as of october   we recorded a million non cash  goodwill impairment charge during the fourth quarter of such goodwill originally arose in connection with our four business acquisitions completed in and these acquisitions were completed during a period when stock valuations for companies in the software sector were generally at much higher levels 
expanded restructuring and cost reduction efforts throughout  we expanded our plan to align costs with current and anticipated economic and industry conditions 
these actions included a voluntary  six month employee salary reduction  headcount reductions  and facilities consolidation 

table of contents we issued approximately one million stock options to certain employees and executives who voluntarily participated in a six month salary exchange program 
in connection with this program  we recorded deferred compensation of approximately  for the intrinsic value of the stock options as of the grant date 
such amount is being amortized to expense over these options one year vesting period 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed with and agreed upon the development and selection of the following critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors revenue recognition  estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of long term investments  estimating business restructuring accruals  and valuation of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
revenue recognition revenue consists of product and service fees 
product fee income is earned through the licensing or right to use our software and from the sale of specific software products 
service fee income is earned through the sale of maintenance and technical support  consulting services and training services 
we do not recognize revenue for agreements with rights of return  refundable fees  cancellation rights or acceptance clauses until such rights to return  refund or cancel have expired or acceptance has occurred 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements 
where software licenses are sold with maintenance or other services  we allocate the total fee to the various elements based on the fair values of the elements specific to us 
we determine the fair value of each element in the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
vsoe of fair value is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately and  for support services  is additionally measured by the renewal rate 
if we do not have vsoe for one of the delivered elements of an arrangement  but do have vsoe for all undelivered elements  we use the residual method to record revenue 
under the residual method  the arrangement fee is first allocated to the undelivered elements based upon their vsoe of fair value  the remaining arrangement fee  including any discount  is allocated to the delivered element 
if the residual method is not used  discounts  if any  are applied proportionately to each element included in the arrangement based on each element s fair value without regard to the discount 
revenue allocated to product license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  we have no significant remaining obligations with regard to implementation  and collection of a fixed or determinable fee is probable 
we consider all payments outside our normal payment terms  including all amounts due in excess of one year  to not be fixed and determinable  and such amounts are recognized as revenue as they become due 
if collectibility is not 
table of contents considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
for software arrangements where we are obligated to perform professional services for implementation  we do not consider delivery to have occurred or customer payment to be probable of collection until no significant obligations with regard to implementation remain 
generally  this would occur when substantially all service work has been completed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the customer s implementation requirements but may vary depending on factors such as an individual customer s payment history or order type eg  initial versus follow on 
revenue from perpetual licenses that include unspecified  additional software products is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  beginning with the delivery of the first product 
revenue allocated to maintenance and support is recognized ratably over the maintenance term typically one year 
revenue allocated to training and consulting service elements is recognized as the services are performed 
our consulting services are not essential to the functionality of our products as i such services are available from other vendors and ii we have sufficient experience in providing such services 
deferred revenue includes amounts received from customers in excess of revenue recognized 
accounts receivable includes amounts due from customers for which revenue has been recognized 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines  discussed above  in determining revenues  however  certain judgments and estimates are made and used to determine revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue recognized for any period if different conditions were to prevail 
for example  in determining whether collection is probable  we assess our customers ability and intent to pay 
our actual experience with respect to collections could differ from our initial assessment if  for instance  unforeseen declines in the overall economy occur and negatively impact our customers financial condition 
allowance for doubtful accounts we continuously assess the collectibility of outstanding customer invoices and in doing such  we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the non collection of customer receivables 
in estimating this allowance  we consider factors such as historical collection experience  a customer s current credit worthiness  customer concentrations  age of the receivable balance  both individually and in the aggregate  and general economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
actual customer collections could differ from our estimates 
for example  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
long term investments long term investments include investments in equity securities of both private and public companies and restricted certificates of deposit with original maturities in excess of one year 
long term investments are recorded at their estimated fair value 
we periodically analyze our long term investments for impairments considered other than temporary 
in performing this analysis  we evaluate whether general market conditions which reflect prospects for the economy as a whole  or information pertaining to an investment s industry or that individual company  indicates that a decline in value that is other than temporary has occurred 
if so  we consider specific factors  including the financial condition and near term prospects of each investment  any event that may affect the investee company  and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we record an investment impairment charge in the line item other income expense  net when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 

table of contents business restructuring we vacated excess leased facilities as a result of the restructuring plan we initiated in and subsequently expanded in we recorded an accrual for the remaining lease liabilities of such vacated properties as well as brokerage commissions  partially offset by estimated sublease income 
we estimated the costs of these excess leased facilities  including estimated costs to sublease and sublease income  based on market information and trend analysis 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
in particular  actual sublease income attributable to the consolidation of excess facilities might deviate from the assumptions used to calculate our accrual for facility lease commitments 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement on january  in accordance with statement  we replaced the ratable amortization of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets with a periodic review and analysis for possible impairment 
we were required to perform a transitional impairment review which involved a two step process step involves identifying reporting units  determining the fair value of each reporting unit  and determining if the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if necessary  step is to be completed before the end of the year in which the company adopts the statement 
step measures the impairment charge and is completed if the fair value is less than the carrying value  as determined in step the completion of this impairment review required management to make complex estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to determining our reporting unit s  selecting the appropriate methodology to determine the estimated fair value of a reporting unit as well as the actual fair value estimation of each reporting unit 
if our estimates or assumptions were to change  this could result in a materially different impairment conclusion 
we performed the required transitional impairment test of goodwill during the first quarter of and determined that we did not have a transitional impairment of goodwill 
subsequent to the transitional impairment test  we must assess goodwill for impairment at least annually 
we assess our goodwill on october of each year and during an interim period if facts or circumstances would more likely than not suggest that the fair value of an identified reporting unit is below its carrying value 
such periodic assessment of goodwill resulted in a significant goodwill impairment charge during the quarter ended december  accounting reclassification and change in accounting estimate effective december   we report all bad debt expense in the operating expense cost category  sales and marketing 
prior to december   we reported a portion of bad debt expense in cost of revenue services 
bad debt expense reported in cost of revenue services for the prior periods presented in this report have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
such reclassification had no impact on the reported net loss  net loss per share or stockholders equity 
bad debt expense reclassified from cost of revenue services to sales and marketing was million and million in and  respectively 
this reclassification increased gross margin by approximately and in and  respectively  and increased sales and marketing as a percentage of sales by a comparable amount 
we reclassified million in deferred revenue at december  from current liabilities to non current liabilities to conform to our current year presentation 
this reclassification did not affect total liabilities  but increased working capital by the amount reclassified  or 
we periodically review the valuation and amortization of our identifiable intangible assets  taking into consideration any events or circumstances that might result in a diminished fair value or useful life 
during the quarter ended march   we changed the estimated useful life of technologies purchased as part of the july acquisition of ondisplay  inc due to changes in product architecture and anticipated future product offerings  we reduced the technology s estimated life from four years to two years 
for the year ended december   this change increased net loss by million and net loss per share by

through our december purchase of epicentric  inc  we acquired certain technological intangible assets having an estimated fair value of million and an estimated useful life of two years 
the amortization of these intangible assets is recorded as a cost of revenue 
we expect license costs to increase as license revenues increase 
services 
services costs decreased in and in these successive decreases in absolute dollars relate primarily to our restructuring efforts via headcount reductions and other cost saving measures 
the overall improvement in services gross profit in both and relates to an increased mix of maintenance and support revenue  in relation to total services revenue 
professional services costs decreased in and in maintenance and support costs increased in and decreased in we expect our services costs  in absolute dollars  to increase slightly in the near future 
we expect services costs as a percentage of services revenue to remain stable over time  but may vary significantly from period to period depending on the mix of services we provide  whether such services are provided by us or third party contractors and overall utilization rates of our services personnel

research and development expenses decreased in and increased in in  the decrease in absolute dollars relates primarily to our restructuring efforts via reduced engineering headcount and other cost saving measures 
the increase as a percentage of revenue resulted from a decrease in total revenue 
in  the increase relates primarily to the timing of the ondisplay acquisition in july this acquisition necessitated greater staffing to support our expanded product offering 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives and  therefore  expect that spending on research and development will remain relatively stable in the near term  however  these expenses may increase over the longer term

the bad debt charges recognized during the first quarter of related to the unfavorable financial impacts the economic downturn had on many of our early stage customers 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in  as a percentage of total revenue  resulted from a decrease in total revenues 
we anticipate sales and marketing expenses to decrease slightly in the near term  however  these expenses may increase over the longer term

specifically  these models employed cash flow projections for revenue based on the projected incremental increase in revenue that the acquired company expected to receive from the completed ipr d 
such assumptions were based on management s estimates and the growth potential of the market 
revenue for the projection periods assumed an annual compound growth 
table of contents rate of  and for datasage  inc  ondisplay  inc  and epicentric  inc  respectively  and was adjusted to reflect the percentage of research and development determined to be complete as of the acquisition date 
cost of revenue  selling  general and administrative expense  and research and development expense were estimated as a percent of revenue based on each acquired company s historical results and industry averages 
the cost to complete the in process products was removed from the research and development expense 
these estimated operating expenses as well as capital charges and applicable income taxes were deducted to arrive at an estimated after tax cash flow 
the after tax cash flow projections were discounted using a risk adjusted rate of return  of  and  respectively 
such discount rates were based on each acquired company s weighted average cost of capital of   and  respectively  as adjusted upwards for the additional risk related to the projects development and success 
the resulting ipr d was expensed at the time of purchase because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
the efforts required to develop the purchased ipr d into commercially viable products related to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification and testing activities that would be necessary to establish that the products could be produced to meet their design specifications  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
the timing for the completion of such efforts was expected to range between twelve and eighteen months 
further  we were uncertain of our ability to complete the products within a timeframe acceptable to the market and ahead of competitors 
impairment of intangible assets 
impairment of intangible assets decreased in and increased in these fluctuations relate primarily to the impairment of goodwill 
we assess our goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
we completed the annual assessment of goodwill using the two step approach  pursuant to statement  and as a result recorded a million charge 
the impairment was recorded in light of sustained negative industry and economic trends impacting current operations  the significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time and our market capitalization relative to our net book value 
the impaired goodwill was originally recorded in connection with the four business combinations effected during and such acquisitions were completed during a period when stock valuations for software companies were generally at much higher levels 
the value determined in step of the assessment  which involves comparing the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit  indicated a goodwill impairment 
we estimated fair value based on market capitalization  as complemented by a discounted cash flow analysis 
we measured the impairment loss by completing step during the fourth quarter of step involved determining the enterprise s implied fair value of goodwill 
the carrying amount of our goodwill was greater than the implied fair value of goodwill  resulting in full impairment of the remaining goodwill recorded in connection with our and business combinations 
also in  the datasage  inc trademark was impaired due to changes in product offerings 
such changes altered the packaging and marketing of certain technology and therefore rendered the related trademark obsolete  resulting in a million impairment charge 
prior to the adoption of statement in  we evaluated enterprise level goodwill pursuant to apb opinion no 
 intangible assets  and recorded an impairment charge in the impairment was recorded in light of significant negative industry and economic trends impacting our operations  the significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time and our market capitalization relative to our net book value 
the overall decline in industry and economic growth rates indicated that this trend may continue for an indefinite period 
using a discounted cash flow approach  we recorded a million non cash impairment charge in the quarter ended december  to reduce enterprise level goodwill to its estimated fair value 
goodwill was originally recorded in connection with our four business acquisitions completed during fiscal years and such acquisitions were generally completed during a period when stock valuations for companies in the software sector were at a much higher level 
the estimate of fair value was based upon the discounted estimated cash flows using a discount rate of and an estimated terminal growth rate of 
the discount rate was based upon our risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital 
the assumptions supporting the estimated cash flows  including the discount rate and estimated 
table of contents terminal value  reflect management s best estimates 
it is reasonably possible that the estimates and assumptions used may change 
we review goodwill and other intangible assets for possible impairment periodically 
sustained negative industry and economic trends  a decline in our stock price and market capitalization for an extended period of time  or changes in our product offerings could result in future impairment charges that are material to our consolidated financial statements 
business restructuring charges 
business restructuring charges decreased in and increased in during  we expanded the restructuring efforts initiated during although we have substantially implemented the restructuring activities announced during and  there can be no assurance that the estimated costs of our restructuring efforts will not change 
components of business restructuring charges and the remaining restructuring accruals as of december  are as follows in thousands facility lease commitments asset impairments employee separation and other costs total balance at december  total restructuring charge cash activity non cash activity balance at december  effect of expanded restructuring plan adjustment to accrual cash activity non cash activity balance at december  less current portion accrued restructuring costs  less current portion facility lease commitments relate to lease obligations for excess office space that we vacated or intend to vacate as a result of the restructuring plan 
total lease commitments include the remaining lease liabilities and brokerage commissions  offset by estimated sublease income 
the estimated costs of vacating these leased facilities  including estimated costs to sublease and any sublease income  were based on market information and trend analysis 
it is reasonably possible that actual results could differ from these estimates in the near term  and such differences could be material to the financial statements 
in particular  actual sublease income attributable to the consolidation of excess facilities might deviate from the assumptions used to calculate the accrual for facility lease commitments 
in  we recorded million in restructuring expense relating to site consolidations 
of this million  million relates to adjustments to previous lease assumptions 
the remaining million relates to additional space consolidation in austin  texas  reston  virginia  gaithersburg  maryland  san ramon  california  waltham  massachusetts  maidenhead  united kingdom  hamburg  germany  madrid  spain  sydney and melbourne  australia  hong kong and singapore

at december   the maximum remaining lease commitment was years 
as a result of our decision to vacate certain office space  to align our infrastructure with current and projected headcount  and to no longer sell or support certain products acquired through business combinations or software arrangements  we impaired certain fixed assets  prepaid royalties and intangible assets  totaling million in and million in 
table of contents employee separation and other costs include severance  related taxes  outplacement and other restructuring charges 
during and  we severed approximately and employees  respectively 
employee groups impacted by the restructuring efforts include personnel in positions throughout the sales  marketing  professional services  engineering and general and administrative functions in all geographies 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
for stock options issued to employees  we record deferred compensation at the grant date if a difference exists between the exercise price and the market value of our common stock 
for restricted share issuances  including those issued in february as part of our stock option exchange program  we record deferred compensation equal to the market value on the issue date 
for the stock options we assumed in connection with our acquisition of ondisplay  inc in july  we have recorded deferred compensation for the difference between the exercise price of the unvested stock options and the fair value of our common stock at the acquisition date 
deferred stock compensation is amortized on an accelerated basis over the vesting periods of the applicable options and restricted share grants 
amortization of deferred stock compensation is attributable to the following cost categories in thousands year ended december  cost of revenue services research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangible assets 
intangible amortization expense decreased in and increased in in  the decrease relates to our adoption of statement for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  statement requires that ratable amortization be replaced with periodic review and analysis for possible impairment 
an intangible asset with a definite life must continue to be amortized over its estimated useful life 
in  the increase relates to amortization of acquired ondisplay intangible assets for a full year 
excluding goodwill  acquired workforce and trademark amortization expense of million  adjusted amortization expense was million in excluding goodwill  acquired workforce and trademark amortization expense of million  adjusted amortization expense was million in the increase in relates to a change in the estimated useful life of technologies purchased as part of the ondisplay  inc acquisition 
due to changes in our product architecture and anticipated future product offerings  the estimated life of this acquired technology was reduced from four years to two years 
such technology was fully amortized at june  other income and expense other income and expense  net consists primarily of interest income and expense  as well as recognized investment gains and losses 
year ended december  compared to compared to other income expense  net other income and expense increased in and decreased in these fluctuations relate primarily to the impairment of certain long term investments 
the impaired long term investments generally consist of redeemable convertible preferred stock in privately held technology companies as well as common stock in publicly held technology companies 
we periodically analyze our long term investments for impairments that are considered other than temporary 
as a result  we recognized impairment charges of million  million and in  and  respectively 

table of contents excluding such investment impairment charges  other income and expense  net was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these successive decreases relate primarily to a general decline in investment yields on our lower cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances as well as a million fixed asset impairment recognized during  not related to our restructuring activities 
at december   our unrestricted  long term investments totaled million 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of an investee could require future impairment charges 
provision for income taxes income tax expense consists primarily of estimated withholdings and income taxes due in certain foreign jurisdictions 
year ended december  compared to compared to provision for income taxes we have provided a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss and research and development carryforwards  because of the uncertainty regarding their realization 
our accounting for deferred taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes statement  involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a full valuation allowance was required  we primarily considered such factors as our history of operating losses and expected future losses and the nature of our deferred tax assets

 as a percentage of total revenue revenue product license services total revenue cost of revenue product license amortization of acquired technology services total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative purchased in process research and development  acquisition related and other charges impairment of intangible assets business restructuring charges amortization of deferred stock compensation amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses loss from operations other income expense  net loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss as a result of our limited operating history  we cannot forecast operating expenses based on historical results 
accordingly  we base our forecast for expenses in part on future revenue projections 
many of these expenses are fixed in the short term  and we may not be able to quickly reduce spending if revenues are lower than we have projected 
our ability to accurately forecast our quarterly revenue is limited due to the long sales cycle of our software products  which makes it difficult to predict the quarter in which product implementation will occur  and the variability of customer demand for professional services 
we would expect our business  operating results and financial condition to be materially adversely affected if revenues do not meet projections and that net losses in a given quarter would be even greater than expected 
our operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and we expect our operating results will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
a number of factors are likely to cause these variations  including demand for our products and services  the timing of sales of our products and services  the timing of customer orders and product implementations  seasonal fluctuations in information technology purchasing  unexpected delays in introducing new products and services  increased expenses  whether related to sales and marketing  product development or administration  changes in the rapidly evolving market for web based applications  the mix of product license and services revenue  as well as the mix of products licensed  the mix of services provided and whether services are provided by our own staff or third party 
table of contents contractors  the mix of domestic and international sales  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  costs related to possible acquisitions of technology or businesses  global events  including terrorist activities and military operations  and the general economic climate 
accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
investors should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance 
net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards as of december   we had federal net operating loss and research and development carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates  between and  if not utilized 
the tax reform act of imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of an ownership change of a corporation 
net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and tax credit carryforwards of million at december  were incurred by diffusion  inc  engine  ltd  datasage  inc  ondisplay  inc and epicentric  inc 
prior to being acquired by us and will be subject to annual limitation 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and tax credits before utilization 
we have provided a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss and research and development carryforwards  because of the uncertainty regarding their realization 
our accounting for deferred taxes under statement involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a full valuation allowance was required  we primarily considered such factors as our history of operating losses and expected future losses and the nature of our deferred tax assets 
as of december   the valuation allowance includes approximately million related to the acquisition of diffusion  inc  engine  ltd  datasage  inc  ondisplay  inc 
and epicentric  inc 
net deferred tax assets 
the initial recognition of these acquired deferred tax asset items will first reduce goodwill  then other non current intangible assets of the acquired entity 
approximately million of the valuation allowance relates to tax benefits for stock option deductions included in the net operating loss carryforward  substantially all of which when realized  will be allocated directly to contributed capital to the extent the benefits exceed amounts attributable to deferred compensation expense 
liquidity and capital resources the following table presents selected financial statistics and information at december  unless otherwise noted dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term investments working capital current ratio days of sales outstanding for the quarter ended at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and no debt 
we invest cash exceeding our operating requirements in short term  investment grade securities and classify these investments as available for sale 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the successive increases in operating cash outflows was due primarily to increases in our net losses  excluding non cash and restructuring charges  and changes in working capital 
we anticipate 
table of contents using net cash to fund operating activities in future periods as well as to fulfill our restructuring and exit commitments 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million in and  respectively and net cash provided by investing activities was million in in  the increase in cash use was due primarily to our increased investment in short term marketable securities and the purchase of epicentric  inc  partially offset by decreased capital expenditures 
in  the increase in cash use was due to significant cash balances acquired through business combinations in and increased investment in short term marketable securities  partially offset by decreased capital expenditures 
we expect that our future investing activities will generally consist of capital expenditures to support our future needs  investment in short term securities to maximize investment yields while preserving cash flow for operational purposes  and acquisition of intellectual property or complementary businesses to expand our market 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our financing activities consisted primarily of employee stock option exercises and purchases of employee stock purchase plan shares 
also included in our financing activities during and were payments for the repurchase of million and million shares of our common stock  totaling million and million  respectively 
our long term investments are classified as available for sale and generally consist of common stock in publicly held technology companies  limited partnership interests in a technology incubator  and cash collateral pledged for certain lease obligations 
at december  and  long term investments totaled million and million  respectively 
the decrease relates primarily to the impairment of certain investments 
we may continue to invest in companies strategic to our business  however  we do not expect future investments to significantly impact our liquidity position 
at december  and  we had pledged million and million  respectively  as cash collateral for certain of our lease obligations 
these investments will remain restricted to the extent that the security requirements exist 
we expect our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances will decline in the near future 
during the quarter ended march   we expect to pay approximately million in remaining consideration for the epicentric  inc acquisition 
we believe that our existing balances will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and investment requirements for at least the next months 
we may require additional funds for other purposes and may seek to raise such additional funds through public and private equity financings or from other sources 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us or that any additional financing will not be dilutive 
at december   future minimum lease payments under noncancelable leases  including million accrued as restructuring charges and million accrued as exit costs in connection with the epicentric acquisition  are as follows operating leases gross commitment contractual sublease income net commitment capital leases thereafter total minimum lease payments amounts representing interest present value of net minimum lease payments including current portion of

issue 
issue requires companies to characterize customer reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses as revenues in the statement of operations 
issue did not have a significant effect on total services revenues or the services gross margin percentages and has no effect on net income loss as it increases both services revenues and cost of services 
because customer reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses were not material for the respective years ended december  or  the consolidated statements of operations for such periods have not been restated

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities statement 
statement addresses accounting for restructuring costs and supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring issue

as a contrast under issue  a liability for an exit cost is recognized when a company commits to an exit plan 
statement also establishes that a liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  statement may affect the timing and amount of recognizing restructuring costs 
we will adopt the provisions of statement for any restructuring activities initiated after december  in november  the fasb reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables issue 
issue sets out criteria for whether revenue can be recognized separately from other deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk the majority of our operations are based in the united states of america and accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
we have operations throughout the americas  europe  asia and australia where transactions are denominated in the local currency of each location 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we currently do not use derivatives to hedge potential exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
to date  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations has not been material to our consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that we do not have material interest risk exposure 
our investment policy requires us to invest funds in excess of current operating requirements in obligations of the us government and its agencies  investment grade state and local government obligations  securities of us corporations rated a or p by standard poors or the moody s equivalents  and money market funds  deposits or notes issued or guaranteed by us and non us commercial banks meeting certain credit rating and net worth requirements with maturities of less than two years

our short term investments will mature in less than one year from december  and were invested in corporate notes  corporate bonds and medium term notes in large us institutions and governmental agencies 
these securities as classified as available for sale and are recorded at their estimated fair market value 
long term investments 
we invest in emerging technology companies considered strategic to our software business 
at december   long term investments consisted of common stock held in publicly traded technology companies and a limited partnership interest in a technology incubator 
we periodically analyze our long term investments for impairments that could be considered other than temporary 
our investments in redeemable convertible preferred stock in privately held technology companies were fully impaired as of june  fair market values were based on quoted market prices where available 
if quoted market prices were not available  we use a composite of quoted market prices of companies that are comparable in size and industry classification to our portfolio 
we classify our long term investments as available for sale and have recorded a cumulative net unrealized gain of million and million related to these securities at december  and  respectively 
in addition to strategic investments  we held million and million in restricted investments at december  and  respectively 
at december   restricted investments were composed of a certificate of deposit and investment grade securities placed with a high credit quality financial institution 
such restricted investments collateralize letters of credit related to certain leased office space security deposits 
these investments will remain restricted to the extent that the security requirements exist 
the maturity dates range from to and the average yield of these investments is approximately
