on september   the company entered into a  multicurrency revolving loan agreement with a group of six banks  which expires on september  on january   the multicurrency revolving loan was amended  increasing the amount available to  on october   the multicurrency revolving loan was amended to modify a financial covenant to restrict the amount of line of credit available to a multiple of domestic earnings 
on april   the multicurrency revolving loan was amended at the company s request  decreasing the amount available to  under the agreement  the company has the option to have interest rates determined based upon the prime rate at pnc bank na plus margin or a libor rate plus margin 
a commitment fee is payable on the unused amount of credit 
the agreement requires the company to maintain certain financial covenants 
the company is in compliance with the covenants of the agreement 
at july   approximately  of the line of credit was available to the company under the formulas contained in the agreement 
the agreement requires that the company maintain a specified level of consolidated net worth  which could restrict the company s ability to pay dividends 
at july   the required consolidated net worth was approximately  and the company s actual consolidated net worth was approximately  there were no borrowings under this line of credit during the years ended july  and long term obligations as a percentage of long term obligations plus stockholders investment were at july  and at july  in november  the company successfully exited a capital lease of a domestic facility 
this capital lease represented approximately million of the long term debt balance at july  the company continues to seek opportunities to invest in new products  new markets and strategic acquisitions that fit its growth strategy 
management believes the company s cash and cash equivalents  the cash flow it generates from operating activities and the company s available line of credit are adequate to meet the company s current investing and financing needs 
the company believes that its strong liquidity and continued strong cash flows will enable it to execute its long term strategic plan 
this strategic plan includes investments  which expand our current market share  open new markets and geographies  develop new products and distribution channels and continue to improve our processes 
this strategic plan also includes executing key acquisitions 
even in uncertain economic times  the company s strong liquidity allows it to continue with investments for the company s future 
should the company remain in an unleveraged position during expansionary times  the company may experience a less rapid rate of growth compared to some of its competitors 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have material off balance sheet arrangements or related party transactions 
the company is not aware of factors that are reasonably likely to adversely affect liquidity trends  other than the risk factors presented in other company filings 
however  the following additional information is provided to assist financial statement users 
ii operating leases these leases generally are entered into only for non strategic investments eg  warehouses  office buildings  computer equipment for which the economic profile is favorable 
purchase commitments the company has purchase commitments for materials  supplies  services  and property  plant and equipment as part of the ordinary conduct of business 
such commitments are not in excess of current market prices 
due to the proprietary nature of many of the company s materials and processes  certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions for early termination 
the company does not believe a material amount of penalties will be incurred under these contracts based upon historical experience and current expectations 
other contractual obligations the company does not have material financial guarantees or other contractual commitments that are reasonably likely to adversely affect liquidity 
related party transactions the company does not have any related party transactions that affect the results of operations  cash flow or financial condition 
payments due under contractual obligations the company s future commitments at july  for long term debt and operating lease obligations are as follows dollars in thousands year ending july  long term debt operating leases total thereafter   total    inflation essentially all of the company s revenue is derived from the sale of its products in competitive markets 
because prices are influenced by market conditions  it is not always possible to fully recover cost increases through pricing 
changes in product mix from year to year and timing differences in instituting price changes make it virtually impossible to accurately define the impact of inflation on profit margins 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss have transferred  there is evidence of an arrangement and collection of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured  all of which generally occur upon shipment of goods to customers 
the vast majority of the company s revenue relates to sale of inventory to customers  and revenue is recognized when title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer 
given the nature of the company s business and the applicable rules guiding revenue recognition  the company s revenue recognition practices do not contain estimates that materially affect results of operations 
restructuring restructuring charges relate to the restructuring activities in fiscal  and the company provides forward looking information about the restructuring activities  including estimated costs and savings 
such disclosures represent management s best estimate  but do require significant estimates that may change over time 
however  the specific reserves recorded in each year under the restructuring activities are not considered highly uncertain  as discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
ii income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
changes in existing regulatory tax laws and rates may affect the company s ability to successfully manage regulatory matters around the world  and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
the company s accounting for deferred tax consequences represents management s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates 
although certain changes cannot be reasonably assumed in the company s current estimates  management does not believe such changes would result in a material period to period impact on the results of operations or financial condition 
goodwill and intangible assets the allocation of purchase price for business combinations requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for purchase price allocation purposes 
if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates  the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require acceleration in the amortization expense of finite lived intangible assets 
in addition  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets be tested annually for impairment 
changes in management estimates or judgments could result in an impairment charge  and such a charge could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
reserves and allowances the company has recorded reserves or allowances for inventory obsolescence  credit memos  allowance for doubtful accounts  incurred but not reported medical claims  compensated absences  incentive compensation and income tax contingencies 
these reserves require the use of estimates and judgment 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the company believes that such estimates are made with consistent and appropriate methods 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this pronouncement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
this pronouncement did not have an effect on the company s financial results 
the company adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
during fiscal in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this pronouncement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some ii circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  this pronouncement does not impact the accounting of any of the company s financial instruments existing at july  forward looking statements except for historical information  the company s reports to the securities and exchange commission on form k and form q and periodic press releases  as well as other public documents and statements  may contain forward looking statements  as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements are often identified by words such as intend  anticipate  assume  believe  estimate  expect  plan  project  will  and other expressions  which refer to future events and trends 
the ability of the company to attain management s goals and objectives is materially dependent on numerous factors  including those set forth herein 
economic conditions operating results are significantly influenced by general economic conditions and growth or contraction of the principal economies in which we operate  including the united states  canada  europe  latin america and the asia pacific region 
this is especially true with respect to growth or contraction of the industrial and technology sectors of those economies 
all economies in which we operate are cyclical and the rates of growth or contraction can vary substantially 
because we have few long term contracts  we generally ship products within a short period of time from receiving orders and thus maintain only a small backlog 
the extent to which we can rapidly adjust our cost structure and output to changing economic conditions may have a significant effect on our future profitability 
currency fluctuations approximately half of our sales are in foreign currencies  which fluctuate in relationship to one another and to the united states dollar 
fluctuations in currencies can cause transaction  translation and other losses 
these fluctuations can have an adverse effect on our reported sales and earnings 
cost of raw materials as a manufacturer  our sales and profitability are also dependent upon availability and cost of raw materials and the ability to control or pass on costs of raw materials and labor 
inflationary and other increases in the costs of raw materials and labor have occurred in the past and are expected to recur 
our ability to reflect these costs in increased selling prices for our products  increasing our productivity  and focusing on higher profit businesses  will significantly influence our ability to maintain our margins 
past performance may or may not be replicable in the future 
reliance on suppliers our manufacturing operations depend on our suppliers ability to deliver quality components and products in time for us to meet critical manufacturing and distribution schedules 
if shortages or delays occur  our operating results could suffer until other sources can be developed 
new products a significant portion of the revenues in each of our recent fiscal years has been represented by sales of products we have introduced within three years prior to the period 
our ability to develop and successfully market new products and to develop  acquire and retain necessary intellectual property rights is therefore essential to maintaining our growth  which ability cannot be assured 
ii acquisitions  strategic alliances  joint ventures and divestitures part of our historic growth has come through acquisitions 
we may also engage in strategic alliances  joint ventures and divestitures 
our ability to effectively evaluate potential acquisition  strategic alliance  joint venture or divestiture transactions and to effectuate such transactions at a reasonable price can affect our profitability 
in addition  acquisitions  strategic alliances and joint ventures may require us to integrate with a different company culture  management team and business infrastructure 
we may also have to develop  manufacture and market products with our products in a way that enhances the performance of the combined business or product line 
depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition  our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors  including the hiring and retention of key employees  management of facilities and employees in separate geographic areas  the integration or coordination of different research and development and product manufacturing facilities  and systems integration and implementation 
all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources  which may divert our attention from other business operations 
intellectual property we generally rely upon patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws in the us and in certain other countries  and agreements with our employees and customers to establish and maintain our property rights in our technology and products 
however  any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property 
even if we do not believe that our products are infringing third parties intellectual property rights  the claims can be time consuming and costly to defend and divert management s attention and resources away from our business 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements 
if we cannot or do not license the infringed technology or substitute similar technology from another source  our business could suffer 
environmental some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal  state and foreign laws governing the environment 
it is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to sites inside and outside the us  even when not subject to local government regulations 
however  a failure to comply with applicable standards or the accidental emission of or exposure to hazardous materials could give rise to significant monetary liability 
also  the imposition of new governmental standards or requirements could materially increase our cost of operation 
effect of international political considerations our international operations may be significantly influenced by political  economic and regulatory conditions including tariffs in the countries in which we conduct our operations 
other other factors include costs and other effects of computer viruses  availability of electricity  natural gas and other sources of power  interest rate increases  legal and administrative cases and proceedings  settlements  judgments and investigations  claims  and changes in those items  adoption of new  or revised accounting policies and practices and the application of such policies and practices  the successful implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system  business reorganizations or combinations  loss of significant contracts or customers  the ability and willingness of purchasers to substitute other products for the products that ii we distribute  and pricing  purchasing  financing and promotional decisions by intermediaries in the distribution channel 
the factors identified in this statement are believed to be important factors but not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results to be materially different from those that may be expressed or implied in any forward looking statement made by  or on behalf of  the company 
other factors not discussed in this statement could also have material adverse effects concerning forward looking objectives or estimates 
the company assumes no obligation to update the information included in this statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s business operations give rise to market risk exposure due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
to manage that risk effectively  the company enters into hedging transactions  according to established guidelines and policies  that enable it to mitigate the adverse effects of this financial market risk 
the global nature of the company s business requires active participation in the foreign exchange markets 
as a result of investments  production facilities and other operations on a global scale  the company has assets  liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the us dollar 
the primary objective of the company s foreign exchange risk management is to minimize the impact of currency movements on intercompany transactions and foreign raw material imports 
to achieve this objective  the company hedges a portion of known exposures using forward contracts 
main exposures are related to transactions denominated in the british pound  the euro  canadian dollar  japanese yen and australian dollar 
the risk of these hedging instruments is not material 
the company could be exposed to interest rate risk through its corporate borrowing activities 
the objective of the company s interest rate risk management activities is to manage the levels of the company s fixed and floating interest rate exposure to be consistent with the company s preferred mix 
the interest rate risk management program consists of entering into approved interest rate derivatives when there is a desire to modify the company s exposure to interest rates 
as of july   the company has not entered into any interest rate derivatives
