plant utilization levels are very important to profitability because of the capital intensive nature of these operations 
at october   the company s blanking and engineered welded blank facilities were operating at near capacity while the stamping and assembly facilities were operating at approximately capacity 
the majority of the company s stamping and engineered welded blank operations purchase steel through the customers steel program 
under these programs  the company pays the steel suppliers and passes on to the customers the steel price the customers negotiated with the steel suppliers 
although the company takes ownership of the steel  the customer is responsible for all steel price fluctuations 
the company also purchases steel directly from primary steel producers and steel service centers 
as most of the company s steel is purchased domestically  the company was not significantly impacted by the recent increase in steel tariffs  but was affected by an increase in steel prices as a result of the tightening of the steel supply in the united states of america 
finally  the company blanks and processes steel for some of its customers on a toll processing basis 
under these arrangements  the company charges a tolling fee for the operations that it performs without acquiring ownership of the steel and being burdened with the attendant costs of ownership and risk of loss 
toll processing operations results in lower revenues but higher gross margins than operations where the company takes ownership of the steel 
revenues from operations involving directly owned steel include a component of raw material cost whereas toll processing revenues do not 
although the proportion of tons of steel which the company uses or processes that is directly owned as compared to toll processed may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on customers needs  the company estimates that of total tons used or processed in its operations  approximately in  in and in were used or processed on a toll processing basis 
revenues from toll processing as a percent of total revenues were approximately in  in and in therefore  an increase in the proportion of total revenues attributable to directly owned steel processing may result in higher revenues but lower gross margins 
changes in the price of scrap steel can have a significant effect on the company s results of operations because substantially all of its operations generate engineered scrap steel 
engineered scrap steel is a planned by product of the company s processing operations 
changes in the price of steel  however  also can impact the company s results of operations because raw material costs are by far the largest component of cost of sales in processing directly owned steel 
the company actively manages its exposure to changes in the price of steel  and  in most instances  passes along the rising price of steel to its customers 
at times  however  the company has been unable to do so 
the company may experience a reduction in its revenues during fiscal as a result of the forecasted decreased volumes in the north american automotive market 
the company will take steps to minimize the impact on its operations of any reduction in revenues 
critical accounting policies preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financials statements and accompanying notes 
the company believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  actual results and the timing of the recognition of such 
table of contents amounts could differ from those estimates 
the company has identified the items that follow as critical accounting policies and estimates utilized by management in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
except for tooling contracts  the company recognizes revenue once it is realized and earned 
this generally occurs once product has been shipped in accordance with an arrangement that exists with the customer  the selling price is determinable based on this arrangement and the company is reasonably certain that it will receive payment from the customer 
the company recognizes revenue on tooling contracts when the contract is complete 
losses are provided for when estimates of total contract revenue and contract costs indicate a loss 
the company reviews the valuation of accounts receivable on a monthly basis 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on historical experience of write offs and the current financial condition of customers 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
the company records inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence or lower of cost or market concerns based upon future demand and current selling prices of individual products 
additional inventory reserves may be required if actual market conditions differ from management s expectations 
the company evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets and the related estimated remaining lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
events or changes in circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to the expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends 
the company records an impairment or change in useful life whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
pension and other post retirement costs and liabilities are actuarially calculated 
these calculations are based on assumptions related to the discount rate  projected salary increases and expected return on assets 
the discount rate assumption is tied to long term high quality bond rates 
the projected salary increase assumption is based on recent trends in wages and salary increases 
the assumption surrounding the expected return on assets for the pension plans is based on the long term expected returns for the investment mix of assets currently in the portfolio 
the return on assets assumption is subject to change depending upon the future asset mix of the portfolio 
the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
the process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
these timing differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies are considered when assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
increases in the valuation allowance result in additional expense to be reflected within the tax provision in the consolidated financial statements

the increases at ohio welded blank division are primarily a result of increases in production at this facility as a result of increased demand related to sport utility platforms on which the company supplies certain parts 
the increases at these locations were partially off set by the overall slow down in the automotive and light truck and heavy truck markets 
in addition  the increase in revenues was partially offset as a result of the loss of revenue with respect to the sale of valley city steel on july  the percentage of revenues from directly owned steel processed was for fiscal compared to for fiscal revenues from toll processed steel were for fiscal compared to for fiscal this shift in the mix of revenue from toll processing to directly owned steel
