item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview iridex corporation is a leading worldwide provider of semiconductor based laser systems used to treat eye diseases in ophthalmology and skin afflictions in aesthetics 
our products are sold in the united states predominantly through a direct sales force and internationally through independent distributors into countries 
our revenues arise primarily from the sale of our iris medical oculight systems  iriderm diolite and apex systems  delivery devices  disposables and  to a lesser extent  revenues from service and support activities 
our current family of oculight systems includes the iris medical oculight symphony  oculight sl  oculight slx  oculight gl and oculight glx laser photocoagulation systems 
in december  we commenced shipment of the millennium endolase module which is sold exclusively to bausch lomb and incorporated into their millennium microsurgical system 
we believe that future growth in unit sales will be derived from growth in sales of peripheral delivery devices  our new product introductions and from the adoption of new procedures using our existing products  such as transpupillary thermotherapy 
sales to international distributors are made on open credit terms or letters of credit 
sales of our products internationally currently are denominated in united states dollars and  accordingly  are subject to risks associated with international monetary conditions and currency fluctuations 
in general  strengthening of the us dollar relative to a foreign currency increases the cost of our product to our customers 
other risks that international sales are subject to include shipping delays  generally longer receivable collection periods  changes in applicable regulatory policies  domestic and foreign tax policies  trade restrictions  duties and tariffs and economic and political instability 
future currency fluctuations or other factors discussed above may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operation 
see factors that may affect future results we depend on international sales for a significant portion of our operating results 
cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of purchasing components and sub systems  assembling  packaging  shipping and testing components at our facility  and the direct labor and associated overhead 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  materials and research support provided to clinicians at medical institutions developing new applications which utilize our products 
research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
sales  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs of personnel  sales commissions  travel expenses  advertising and promotional expenses  facilities  legal and accounting  insurance and other expenses which are not allocated to other departments

   total    during fiscal  we continued to face downturns in our market  which started early in calendar year  and are due to the worldwide economic slowdown and related uncertainties 
for several quarters during  we experienced reduced demand for our products as a result of these weakened economic conditions 
combined ophthalmology and aesthetics sales in  sales increased by to million from million in domestic sales  which represented of total sales  increased by million or 
the increase in domestic sales was primarily a result of million in unit sales improvements  particularly for visible lasers  including sales of the new millenium endolase module to bausch lomb  a million increase in unit sales of delivery devices for our ophthalmology products  million in increased domestic aesthetic sales and million in increased service revenue offset  in part  by million in lower average selling prices 
international sales  which were of total sales  decreased by million or 
the decrease in international sales in was due mainly to the strength of the us dollar for most of this made our products cost more in foreign markets  since sales of our products internationally are denominated in us dollars  thereby decreasing international sales by million 
we face challenges marketing and selling our products in the current difficult economic environment  both domestically and internationally  and expect to continue to face these challenges for the foreseeable future 
see factors that may affect future results our business has been adversely impacted by the worldwide economic slowdown and related uncertainties 
in  sales decreased by to million from million in primarily as a result of decreased unit sales of our ophthalmology products 
domestic sales which represented of total sales  decreased by million or primarily as a result of weakened economic conditions in the united states of america and million due to lower average selling prices for aesthetics products 
international sales  which were of total net sales  decreased by million or primarily as a result of the strength of the us dollar 
to compensate  we lowered our average selling prices for our ophthalmology products which resulted in million less international sales 
ophthalmology sales ophthalmology sales increased in by million or to million 
domestic ophthalmology sales increased by million or to million 
domestic ophthalmology sales increased during this period mainly as a result of million in increased unit sales of visible laser consoles  including the millenium endolase module  million in increased unit sales of delivery devices and million in increased service revenue offset  in part  by a decrease in average selling prices of million 
international ophthalmology sales decreased by million or to million 
the decrease in international sales was due primarily to a million decrease in unit sales of infrared laser consoles  which resulted from the stronger us dollar in  offset by a million increase in combined unit sales of visible laser consoles and delivery devices 
in  ophthalmology sales decreased million or to million 
domestic ophthalmology sales decreased million or to million 
international ophthalmology sales decreased by million or to million 
the decrease in domestic sales was due primarily to weakened economic conditions in the us in addition  sales of our oculight slx  in particular  were impacted in the united states as a result of uncertainties surrounding reimbursement by the center for medicare and medicaid cms for certain procedures to treat age related macular degeneration amd using our products 
the decrease in international sales included a million decrease in average selling prices for our ophthalmology products 
aesthetics sales aesthetics sales increased in by million or to million 
domestic aesthetics sales increased by million or to million 
the increase in domestic aesthetics sales was due mainly to a million increase from to in unit sales of the apex laser system which was introduced in july  a million increase in unit sales of delivery devices and million in increased service revenue offset  in part  by a million decrease in unit sales of the diolite laser and a decrease in average selling prices of million 
international aesthetics sales decreased by million or to million 
increases in international unit sales of the apex laser system of million and in delivery devices of million were offset by a million decrease in unit sales of the diolite we expect that the current economic slowdown will continue to adversely affect sales of our aesthetic products  particularly the apex laser system  and to a greater extent than sales of our ophthalmology products since aesthetic procedures are typically elective and therefore can be deferred  while ophthalmology procedures are typically not deferred 
in addition  the continued political uncertainties in the middle east and any extended hostilities in iraq  to the extent these factors affect worldwide economic conditions  may adversely impact our international sales 
see factors that may affect future results our business has been adversely impacted by the worldwide economic slowdown and related uncertainties 
aesthetics sales increased in by million or to million 
domestic aesthetics sales increased by million or to million 
international aesthetics sales increased million or to million 
the overall increase in aesthetics sales in was due primarily to sales of our apex laser system  which we introduced in july included in the increase in aesthetics sales from to was a million decrease in domestic average selling prices 
gross profit 
gross profit was million in  million in and million in gross profit represented of sales in  in and in gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased in by as compared to the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales was due primarily to for inventory related charges  for increased warranty costs related to a change in estimate  for lower average selling prices offset  in part  by increased gross margin of associated with a reduction in direct inventory costs and for increased domestic sales which have a higher gross margin 
we intend to continue our efforts to reduce the cost of components and thereby mitigate the impact of price reductions on our gross profit 
we believe gross profit in dollars will increase as volumes increase and unit production costs will decrease as costs are engineered out of new products 
however  gross margins as a percentage of sales will continue to fluctuate due to changes in the relative proportions of domestic and international sales  the mix of product sales  costs associated with future product introductions and a variety of other factors 
see factors that may affect future results our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased in as compared to of this decrease  was due to decreased sales volume of the oculight slx  which has a relatively higher gross margin 
in addition  fixed manufacturing costs were spread over a lower sales volume and we experienced higher initial production costs of our apex hair removal laser  which decreased gross profit as a percentage of sales in as compared to by 
we also charged to expense million of inventory related to the oculight which decreased gross profit by an additional 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased by in to million and decreased by in to million from million in these expenses were of sales in  of sales in and of sales in the decrease in  in absolute dollars  consisted of million in reduced personnel spending related to a reduction in force in june  million in reduced spending due to the completion of the apex hair removal laser system in  offset  in part  by a million increase in clinical spending 
the decrease in research and development expenses in  as a percentage of sales  was due to the decline in expenses in absolute dollars and an increase in the level of sales exceeding the increase in research and development expense 
we expect to increase our research and development expenditures in as we conduct additional development projects with our existing research and development staff 
the decrease in  in absolute dollars was primarily due to a reduction of expenses of million related to the completion of the apex and million due to cost containment measures  offset in part by a million increase in other new project spending 
the increase in research and development expenses in  as a percentage of sales  was driven by the decrease in sales which exceeded the decrease in research and development costs 
sales  general and administrative 
sales  general and administrative expenses decreased by in to million and decreased by in to million from million in these expenses were of sales in  of sales in and of sales in the decrease in sales  general and administrative expenses  in absolute dollars  from to consisted of reduced marketing and administrative personnel spending of million related  in part  to the reduction in force in june  million in reduced spending on marketing programs  million in reduced insurance spending and million of other cost containment actions targeted at non personnel expenses and resulting in reduced costs 
the decrease  as a percentage of net sales  from to was attributable to the decline in expenses in absolute dollars and an increase in the level of sales exceeding the increase in sales  general and administrative expense 
from to  sales  general and administrative expenses  in absolute dollars  decreased as a result of million in lower commissions  million from fewer marketing and administrative personnel and million of other cost containment actions 
the increase in sales  general and administrative expense  as a percentage of net sales  from to was due to the decrease in the level of sales exceeding the decrease in sales  general and administrative expense 
other income  net 
other income  net consists primarily of interest income 
interest income was   and  in  and  respectively 
this income was primarily from interest earned on available for sale securities 
interest income decreased in both and compared with and  respectively  because of lower interest rates in and and overall lower average cash balances in income taxes 
in  our effective rate was a benefit of primarily as a result of pretax income nearing zero and the level of tax credits for research and development activities relative to the loss for our effective tax rate for was a benefit of and in it was 
the tax rate for and was lower than the federal and state combined statutory rate of because of certain tax benefits associated with tax exempt interest on tax preferred securities and with tax credits for research and development activities 
discontinued operations 
in april  we discontinued our laser research segment 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a loss of  net of a  tax benefit 
in the fourth quarter of  we adjusted the loss on discontinued operations to  net of a  income tax benefit 
revenues for this segment were  for costs and operating expenses of the laser research segment were  for sales  general and administrative costs and indirect costs of manufacturing historically were not allocated to the laser research segment 
the laser research segment conducted research and development under research grants from the us federal government and others 
we discontinued our laser research activities to better focus available resources on our medical applications and products 
the assets of the segment  primarily inventory  were fully reserved and the liabilities were fully paid 
the components of the recorded loss were inventory costs of million  the loss on operations for the first quarter of of million  estimated sales return costs of million  estimated costs for the phase out period of million and purchase order commitments of million offset by a tax benefit of million 
in the fourth quarter of  the accrued loss for the discontinuation of the segment was adjusted to reflect fewer than anticipated product returns 
reduction in force 
during the quarter ended june   we reduced our workforce by seventeen positions or approximately 
for the three months ended june   we recorded restructuring charges totaling approximately  that were related primarily to the severance costs associated with the headcount reduction instituted in the second quarter of the reduction in workforce is expected to reduce employee related costs by million annually going forward 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our primary sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million and available for sale securities of million  for a total of million 
in addition  we have available million under our unsecured line of credit which bears interest at the bank s prime rate and expires in october as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under this credit facility 
we expect to renew the line of credit in october assuming that terms continue to be acceptable 
we believe that  based on current estimates  our current cash  available for sale securities and the credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements at least through the next twelve months 
however  we believe that the level of financial resources is a significant competitive factor in our industry  and accordingly we may choose to raise additional capital through debt or equity financing prior to the end of we generated  in cash and cash equivalents during in  we used  in cash and cash equivalents 
in  we generated  net cash generated by operations in totaled  as compared with  used in operations in and  used in operations in in  sources of cash included decreases in net inventories of  depreciation of  increases in accrued expenses of  decreases in prepaid expenses of  and net income of  uses of cash in included decreases in accounts payable of  increases in net accounts receivable of  and an increase in the deferred tax asset of  the decrease in inventory and accounts payable was due mainly to implementation of an inventory reduction program 
the increase in accrued expenses consisted mainly of million for income tax payable  million for an increase in accrued warranty and million for an accrued liability 
the decrease in prepaid expenses consisted primarily of million for tax receivable 
in  uses of cash included increases in net inventories of  a net loss of  increases in deferred income taxes of  decreases in accrued expenses of  decreases in net accounts receivable of  offset by sources of cash from operations which included depreciation of  tax benefit of employee stock option plans of  and decreases in prepaids and other current assets of  the increase in inventory was due primarily to material purchases associated with the apex which commenced shipment in july the increase in deferred income taxes was due primarily to the tax loss generated in the decrease in accrued expenses resulted primarily from a decrease in accrued payroll 
the decrease in accounts payable related to a decreased level of inventory receipts at the end of the year 
prepaid and other current assets decreased due to decreases in accounts payable of  and decreased prepaid spending on trade shows 
we generated  for investing activities in we used  and  of cash in and respectively 
net cash provided by or used in investing activities was primarily due to the sale or purchase and proceeds of available for sale securities and the acquisition of fixed assets 
net cash provided by financing activities during  and was   and  respectively  which consisted primarily of issuance of stock in connection with our employee stock programs  offset in part by purchase of treasury stock of  in in december  we instituted a stock repurchase program whereby up to  shares of our common stock may be repurchased in the open market 
we plan to utilize all of the reacquired shares for reissuance in connection with employee stock programs 
no shares of our common stock from the open market were purchased during and in  we purchased  shares of our common stock from the open market 
as of december  we have repurchased  shares of common stock 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  net sales and expenses  and the related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience  our knowledge of economic and market factors and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant estimates  assumptions  and judgments used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized upon receipt of a purchase order and product shipment provided no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivables is deemed probable 
shipments are generally made with free on board fob shipping point terms  whereby title passes upon shipment from our dock 
any shipments with fob receiving point terms are recorded as revenue when the shipment arrives at the receiving point 
up front fees received in connection with product sales are deferred and recognized over the associated product shipments 
warranty the company accrues for estimated warranty costs upon shipment of products in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
actual warranty costs incurred have not materially differed from those accrued 
the company s warranty policy is effective for shipped products which are considered defective or fail to meet the product specifications 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowance 
warranty costs are reflected in the income statement as a cost of revenues 
sales returns allowance and allowance for doubtful accounts in the process of preparing financial statements we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  we must estimate future product returns related to current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowance and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
the provision for sales returns amounted to million in similarly our management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a standard cost basis which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out fifo method 
lower of cost or market is evaluated by considering obsolescence  excessive levels of inventory  deterioration and other factors 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
changes in estimate of future levels of taxable income or tax planning strategies could result in the need to provide or increase the valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets which could materially impact earnings in the period of change 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes purchase commitments and minimum rentals due for our facility and other leased assets under long term  non cancelable operating leases as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years operating leases 
unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations 
  contractual purchase obligations have varying cancellation terms 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
rescission of fasb statement no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  which eliminates inconsistencies between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
sfas no 
also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after may  and for transactions occurring after may  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position or on our results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities which addresses the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance that the eitf has set forth in eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position or on our results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 or fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee 
in addition  fin requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued  including a reconciliation of changes in the entity s product warranty liabilities 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position or on our results of operations 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf establishes criteria for whether revenue on a deliverable can be recognized separately from other deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement 
the criteria consider whether the delivered item has standalone value to the customer  whether the fair value of the delivered item can be reliably determined and the rights of returns for the delivered items 
eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal years beginning june  with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect that the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on our financial position or on our results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also requires prominent disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation in both annual and interim financial statements 
the transition and annual disclosure requirements of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods beginning after december  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or on our results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities which possess certain characteristics 
the interpretation requires that if a business enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities  and results of the activities of the variable interest entity must be included in the consolidated financial statements with those of the business enterprise 
this interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
we do not have any ownership in any variable interest entities as of december  we will apply the consolidation requirements of fin in future periods if we should own any interest in any variable interest entity 
factors that may affect future results we rely on continued market acceptance of our existing products and any decline in sales of our existing products would adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we currently market visible and infrared light semiconductor based photocoagulator medical laser systems to the ophthalmic market 
we also market a visible and infrared light semiconductor based photocoagulator medical laser system to the aesthetics market 
we believe that continued and increased sales  if any  of these medical laser systems is dependent upon a number of factors including the following product performance  features  ease of use  scalability and durability recommendations and opinions by ophthalmologists  dermatologists  clinicians  and their associated opinion leaders  price of our products and prices of competing products and technologies availability of competing products  technologies and alternative treatments  willingness of ophthalmologists and dermatologists to convert to semiconductor based or infrared laser systems from alternative technologies  and level of reimbursement for treatments administered with our products 
any significant decline in market acceptance of our products would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we face strong competition in our markets and expect the level of competition to grow in the foreseeable future 
competition in the market for devices used for ophthalmic and aesthetic treatments is intense and is expected to increase 
this market is also characterized by rapid technological innovation and change and our products could be rendered obsolete as a result of future innovations 
our competitive position depends on a number of factors including product performance  characteristics and functionality  ease of use  scalability  durability and cost 
our principal competitors in ophthalmology are lumenis ltd  nidek  inc  carl zeiss  inc  alcon inc 
and quantel 
all of these companies currently offer a competitive  semiconductor based laser system in ophthalmology 
our principal competitors in aesthetics are lumenis ltd  laserscope  candela corporation  altus medical inc and palomar medical technologies  inc some competitors have substantially greater financial  engineering  product development  manufacturing  marketing and technical resources than we do 
some companies also have greater name recognition than us and long standing customer relationships 
in addition to other companies that manufacture photocoagulators  we compete with pharmaceuticals  other technologies and other surgical techniques 
some medical companies  academic and research institutions or others may develop new technologies or therapies that are more effective in treating conditions targeted by us or are less expensive than our current or future products 
any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future success depends on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and applications 
our current products provide applications in the fields of ophthalmology and aesthetics 
we cannot assure you that the market for these applications will continue to generate significant or consistent demand for our products 
demand for our products could be significantly diminished by new technologies or products that replace them or render them obsolete 
our future success is dependent upon  among other factors  our ability to develop  obtain regulatory approval of  manufacture and market new products 
in october  we announced the introduction of a number of new products  specifically the oculight symphony multi wavelength laser delivery system  an expanded endoprobe product line and a mm large spot slit lamp adapter 
we also announced the millenium endolase module  which we manufacture to be included in bausch lomb s millenium microsurgical system 
successful commercialization of these new products and new applications will require that we effectively transfer production processes from research and development to manufacturing and effectively coordinate with our suppliers 
in addition  we must successfully sell and achieve market acceptance of new products and applications and enhanced versions of existing products 
the extent of  and rate at which  market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products  is a function of many variables 
these variables include price  safety  efficacy  reliability  marketing and sales efforts  the development of new applications for these products  the availability of third party reimbursement of procedures using our new products  the existence of competing products and general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns 
our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation  including approval by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  and foreign government agencies 
any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products or enhanced versions of existing products and achieve market acceptance of new products and new applications could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and would cause our net revenues to decline 
our business has been adversely impacted by the worldwide economic slowdown and related uncertainties 
weaker economic conditions worldwide  particularly in the us  have contributed to the continued slowdown in our business in general 
this has resulted in reduced demand for some of our products  particularly in our aesthetics products  such as the apex  excess manufacturing capacity under current market conditions and higher manufacturing overhead costs as a percentage of revenue 
recent political and social turmoil in many parts of the world  including terrorist and military actions  may continue to adversely impact global economic conditions 
these political  social and economic conditions and related economic uncertainties are making it very difficult for us  our customers and our distributors to forecast orders and sales of our products and  accordingly  plan future business activities 
in addition  the continued political uncertainties in the middle east and any extended hostilities in iraq  to the extent these factors affect worldwide economic conditions  may adversely impact out international sales 
this level of uncertainty strongly challenges our ability to operate profitably or grow our business 
if the economic or market conditions continue or further deteriorate  this may have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operation and cash flows 
if we cannot increase our sales volumes  reduce our costs or introduce higher margin products to offset anticipated reductions in the average unit price of our products  our operating results may suffer 
we have experienced declines in the average unit price of our products and expect to continue to suffer from declines in the future 
the average unit price of our products may decrease in the future in response to changes in product mix  competitive pricing pressures  new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors 
if we are unable to offset the anticipated decrease in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes  our net revenues will decline 
in addition  to maintain our gross margins  we must continue to reduce the manufacturing cost of our products 
further  should average unit prices of our current products decline  we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements with higher margins 
if we cannot maintain our gross margins  our business could be seriously harmed  particularly if the average selling price of our products decreases significantly without a corresponding increase in sales 
we face risks of manufacturing 
the manufacture of our infrared and visible light photocoagulators and the related delivery devices is a highly complex and precise process 
we assemble critical subassemblies and the final product at our facility in mountain view  california 
although our oculight systems  diolite and our apex have been introduced  we continue to face risks associated with manufacturing these products 
various difficulties may occur despite testing 
furthermore  we may experience delays  disruptions  capacity constraints or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations and  as a result  product shipments to our customers could be delayed  which would negatively impact our net revenues 
we depend on sole source or limited source suppliers 
we rely on third parties to manufacture substantially all of the components used in our products  including optics  laser diodes and crystals 
we have some long term or volume purchase agreements with our suppliers and currently purchase components on a purchase order basis 
some of our suppliers and manufacturers are sole or limited source 
in addition  some of these suppliers are relatively small private companies that may discontinue their operations at any time 
there are risks associated with the use of independent manufacturers  including the following unavailability of  shortages or limitations on the ability to obtain supplies of components in the quantities that we require  delays in delivery or failure of suppliers to deliver critical components on the dates we require  failure of suppliers to manufacture components to our specifications  and potentially reduced quality  and inability to obtain components at acceptable prices 
our business and operating results may suffer from the lack of alternative sources of supply for critical sole and limited source components 
the process of qualifying suppliers is complex  requiring extensive testing and interoperability with our products  and may be lengthy  particularly as new products are introduced 
new suppliers would have to be educated in our production processes 
in addition  the use of alternate components may require design alterations to our products and additional product testing under fda and relevant foreign regulator agency guidelines  which may delay sales and increase product costs 
any failures by our vendors to adequately supply limited and sole source components may impair our ability to offer our existing products  delay the submission of new products for regulatory approval and market introduction  materially harm our business and financial condition and cause our stock price to decline 
establishing our own capabilities to manufacture these components would be expensive and could significantly decrease our profit margins 
we do not currently intend to manufacture any of these components 
our business and results of operations would be adversely affected if we are unable to continue to obtain components in the quantity and quality desired and at the prices we have budgeted 
we depend on international sales for a significant portion of our operating results 
we derive and expect to continue to derive a large portion of our revenue from international sales 
in  and  our international sales were million  million and million  or   and  respectively  of total sales 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future 
none of our international revenues and costs has been denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies makes our products more expensive and thus less competitive in foreign markets 
the factors stated above could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our international operations and sales are subject to a number of risks  including longer accounts receivable collection periods  impact of recessions in economies outside of the united states  foreign certification requirements  including continued ability to use the ce mark in europe  reduced or limited protections of intellectual property rights in jurisdictions outside the united states  potentially adverse tax consequences  and multiple protectionist  adverse and changing foreign governmental laws and regulations 
any one or more of these factors stated above could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
for additional discussion about our foreign currency risks  see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
our operating results may be adversely affected by changes in third party coverage and reimbursement policies and any uncertainty regarding healthcare reform measures 
our ophthalmology products are typically purchased by doctors  clinics  hospitals and other users  which bill various third party payers  such as governmental programs and private insurance plans  for the health care services provided to their patients 
third party payers are increasingly scrutinizing and challenging the coverage of new products and the level of reimbursement for covered products 
doctors  clinics  hospitals and other users of our products may not obtain adequate reimbursement for use of our products from third party payers 
while we believe that the laser procedures using our products have generally been reimbursed  payers may deny coverage and reimbursement for our products if they determine that the device was not reasonable and necessary for the purpose used  was investigational or was not cost effective 
in addition  third party payers may not initiate coverage of new procedures using our products for a significant period 
for example  in september  the center for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  advised that claims for reimbursement for certain amd procedures  which use our oculight slx laser system  could be submitted for reimbursement  with coverage and payment to be determined by the local medical carriers at their discretion 
to date  only two carriers  noridian mutual insurance  which is the cms part b carrier for alaska  arizona  colorado  hawaii  iowa  nevada  north dakota  oregon  south dakota  washington and wyoming  as well as cigna  which is the carrier for north carolina  tennessee and idaho  have made coverage decisions approving the use of the transpupillary thermotherapy  or ttt protocol for the treatment of wet amd 
no other carriers have approved reimbursement of such amd procedures using the oculight slx and domestic sales of the oculight slx laser system continue to be limited until more local medical carriers reimburse for performing such amd procedures or until cms advises that claims foe these procedures may be submitted directly to cms at the national level 
changes in government legislation or regulation or in private third party payers policies toward reimbursement for procedures employing our products may prohibit adequate reimbursement 
there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system  reduce the costs of healthcare and change medical reimbursement policies 
doctors  clinics  hospitals and other users of our products may decline to purchase our products to the extent there is uncertainty regarding reimbursement of medical procedures using our products and any healthcare reform measures 
further proposed legislation  regulation and policy changes affecting third party reimbursement are likely 
we are unable to predict what legislation or regulation  if any  relating to the health care industry or third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future  or what effect such legislation or regulation may have on us 
however  denial of coverage and reimbursement for our products would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are dependent on the successful outcome of clinical trials of our products and new applications using our products 
our success will depend in part on the successful outcome of clinical trials of our products and new applications using our products 
clinical trials are long  expensive and uncertain processes 
we are currently supporting several ongoing clinical trials including  for example  the tttcnv clinical trial 
the tttcnv clinical trial is a multi center  prospective  placebo controlled  randomized trial conducted at centers in the united states 
this clinical trial is a post marketing study performed within the fda cleared indications of the oculight slx and is being conducted to determine whether ttt laser treatment using our oculight slx infrared laser system and large spot slit lamp adapter can reduce the risk of vision loss for patients with wet age related macular degeneration amd compared to sham treated eyes 
in order to successfully commercialize the use of our oculight slx for ttt procedures  we must be able to  among other things  demonstrate with substantial evidence from well controlled clinical trials where ttt procedures using the oculight slx product fits within the treatment regimen of wet amd 
this process may take a number of years 
in march  we announced that the executive committee for the tttcnv clinical trial accepted the recommendations of the independent data and safety monitoring committee that an adequate number of patients were enrolled to detect a clinically relevant difference between outcomes in ttt treated eyes and patients not being treated 
we cannot assure you that results from the tttcnv clinical trial will prove to be successful 
if the future results of the tttcnv clinical trial or any other clinical trial regarding our products fails to validate the safety and effectiveness of treatments using our products  our ability to generate revenues from new products or new applications using our products would be adversely affected and our business would be harmed 
our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year 
our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year in the future 
our operating results are affected by a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
factors contributing to these fluctuations include the following general economic uncertainties and political concerns  the timing of the introduction and market acceptance of new products  product enhancements and new applications  changes in demand for our existing line of aesthetic and ophthalmic products  the cost and availability of components and subassemblies  including the ability of our sole or limited source suppliers to deliver components at the times and prices that we have planned  fluctuations in our product mix between aesthetic and ophthalmic products and foreign and domestic sales  the effect of regulatory approvals and changes in domestic and foreign regulatory requirements  introduction of new products  product enhancements and new applications by our competitors  entry of new competitors into our markets  pricing pressures and other competitive factors  our long and highly variable sales cycle  decreases in the prices at which we can sell our products  changes in customers or potential customers budgets as a result of  among other things  reimbursement policies of government programs and private insurers for treatments that use our products  and increased product development costs 
in addition to these factors  our quarterly results have been and are expected to continue to be affected by seasonal factors 
our expense levels are based  in part  on expected future sales 
if sales levels in a particular quarter do not meet expectations  we may be unable to adjust operating expenses quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall of sales  and our results of operations may be adversely affected 
in addition  we have historically made a significant portion of each quarter s product shipments near the end of the quarter 
if that pattern continues  any delays in shipment of products could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for such quarter 
due to these and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter and year to year comparisons of our past operating results may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on our results for any quarter or year as an indication of our future performance 
our operating results in future quarters and years may be below public market analysts expectations  which would likely cause the price of our common stock to fall 
we rely on our direct sales force and network of international distributors to sell our products and any failure to maintain our direct sales force and distributor relationships could harm our business 
our ability to sell our products and generate revenue depends upon our direct sales force within the united states and relationships with independent distributors outside the united states 
as of december   our direct sales force consisted of employees and we maintained relationships with independent distributors internationally selling our products into countries 
we generally grant our distributors exclusive territories for the sale of our products in specified countries 
the amount and timing of resources dedicated by our distributors to the sales of our products is not within our control 
our international sales are entirely dependent on the efforts of these third parties 
if any distributor breaches or fails to generate sales of our products  we may be forced to replace the distributor and our ability to sell our products in that exclusive sales territory would be adversely affected 
we do not have any long term employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force 
we may be unable to replace our direct sales force personnel with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications  which may limit our revenues and our ability to maintain market share 
the loss of the services of these key personnel would harm our business 
similarly  our distributorship agreements are generally terminable at will by either party and distributors may terminate their relationships with us  which would affect our international sales and results of operations 
we depend on collaborative relationships to develop  introduce and market new products  product enhancements and new applications 
we have entered into collaborative relationships with academic medical centers and physicians in connection with the research and development and clinical testing of new products 
we plan to collaborate with third parties to develop and commercialize existing and new products 
in october  we announced our collaboration with bausch lomb to design and manufacture a solid state green wavelength nm laser photocoagulator module  called the millenium endolase module 
the millenium endolase module is designed to be a component of bausch lomb s ophthalmic surgical suite product offering and is not expected to be sold as a stand alone product 
sales of the millenium endolase module are dependent upon the actual order rate from and shipment rate to bausch lomb  which depends on the efforts of our partner and is beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our relationship with bausch lomb will result in sales of our millenium endolase module  if at all 
our collaborators may not pursue further development and commercialization of products resulting from collaborations with us or may not devote sufficient resources to the marketing and sale of such products 
additionally  our reliance on others for clinical development  manufacturing and distribution of our products may result in unforeseen problems 
further  our collaborative partners may develop or pursue alternative technologies either on their own or in collaboration with others 
if a collaborator elects to terminate its agreement with us  our ability to develop  introduce  market and sell the product may be significantly impaired and we may be forced to discontinue the product resulting from the collaboration altogether 
we may not be able to negotiate alternative collaborative agreements on acceptable terms  if at all 
the failure of any current or future collaboration efforts could have a material adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products or applications and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we rely on patents and other proprietary rights to protect our intellectual property and business 
our success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon our proprietary information 
we rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
we file patent applications to protect technology  inventions and improvements that are significant to the development of our business 
we have been issued thirteen united states patents and one foreign patent on the technologies related to our products and processes 
we have approximately seven pending patent applications in the united states and six foreign pending patent applications that have been filed 
our patent applications may not be approved 
any patents granted now or in the future may offer only limited protection against potential infringement and development by our competitors of competing products 
moreover  our competitors  many of which have substantial resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  may seek to apply for and obtain patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make  use or sell our products either in the united states or in international markets 
in addition to patents  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how which we seek to protect  in part  through proprietary information agreements with employees  consultants and other parties 
our proprietary information agreements with our employees and consultants contain industry standard provisions requiring such individuals to assign to us  without additional consideration  any inventions conceived or reduced to practice by them while employed or retained by us  subject to customary exceptions 
proprietary information agreements with employees  consultants and others may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
also  our trade secrets may become known to or independently developed by competitors 
the laser and medical device industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
companies in the medical device industry have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
numerous patents are held by others  including academic institutions and our competitors 
until recently  patent applications were maintained in secrecy in the united states until the patents issued 
patent applications filed in the united states after november generally will be published eighteen months after the filing date 
however  since patent applications continue to be maintained in secrecy for at least some period of time  both within the united states and with regards to international patent applications  we cannot assure you that our technology does not infringe any patents or patent applications held by third parties 
we have  from time to time  been notified of  or have otherwise been made aware of claims that we may be infringing upon patents or other proprietary intellectual property owned by others 
if it appears necessary or desirable  we may seek licenses under such patents or proprietary intellectual property 
although patent holders commonly offer such licenses  licenses under such patents or intellectual property may not be offered or the terms of any offered licenses may not be reasonable 
any claims  with or without merit and regardless of whether we are successful on the merits  would be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel  cause shipment delays or require us to develop noninfringing technology or to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding and failure to obtain necessary licenses or develop alternate technologies could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are subject to government regulation which may cause us to delay or withdraw the introduction of new products or new applications for our products 
the medical devices that we market and manufacture are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and foreign governments 
under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and the related regulations  the fda regulates the design  development  clinical testing  manufacture  labeling  sale  distribution and promotion of medical devices 
before a new device can be introduced into the market  the product must undergo rigorous testing and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the fda under federal law 
a device manufacturer must obtain market clearance through either the k premarket notification process or the lengthier premarket approval  or pma  application process 
depending upon the type  complexity and novelty of the device and the nature of the disease or disorder to be treated  the fda approval process can take several years  require extensive clinical testing and result in significant expenditures 
even if regulatory approval is obtained  later discovery of previously unknown safety issues may result in restrictions on the product  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
other countries also have extensive regulations regarding clinical trials and testing prior to new product introductions 
our failure to obtain government approvals or any delays in receipt of such approvals would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the fda imposes additional regulations on manufacturers of approved medical devices 
we are required to comply with the applicable fda good manufacturing practice regulations  which include quality control and quality assurance requirements  as well as maintenance of records and documentation 
our manufacturing facilities are subject to ongoing periodic inspections by the fda and corresponding state agencies  including unannounced inspections  and must be licensed as part of the product approval process before being utilized for commercial manufacturing 
noncompliance with the applicable requirements  can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  withdrawal of marketing approvals  and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to request repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any device we manufacture or distribute 
any of these actions by the fda would materially and adversely affect our ability to continue operating our business and the results of our operations 
in addition  we are also subject to varying product standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements  tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
as a result of our sales in europe  we are required to have all products ce registered  an international symbol affixed to all products demonstrating compliance to the european medical device directive and all applicable standards 
while currently all of our released iris medical and iriderm products are ce registered  continued registration is based on successful review of the process by our european registrar during their annual audit 
any loss of registration would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if product liability claims are successfully asserted against us  we may incur substantial liabilities that may adversely affect our business or results of operations 
we may be subject to product liability claims in the future 
our products are highly complex and are used to treat extremely delicate eye tissue and skin conditions on and near a patient s face 
although we maintain product liability insurance with coverage limits of million per occurrence and an annual aggregate maximum of million  our coverage from our insurance policies may not be adequate 
product liability insurance is expensive 
we might not be able to obtain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts to protect us  if at all 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we fail to accurately forecast demand for our product and component requirements for the manufacture of our product  we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays and may experience lost sales or significant inventory carrying costs 
we use quarterly and annual forecasts based primarily on our anticipated product orders to plan our manufacturing efforts and determine our requirements for components and materials 
it is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our product and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and materials 
lead times for components vary significantly and depend on numerous factors  including the specific supplier  the size of the order  contract terms and current market demand for such components 
if we overestimate the demand for our product  we may have excess inventory  which would increase our costs 
if we underestimate demand for our product and  consequently  our component and material requirements  we may have inadequate inventory  which could interrupt our manufacturing  delay delivery of our product to our customers and result in the loss of customer sales 
any of these occurrences would negatively impact our business and operating results 
if we fail to manage growth effectively  our business could be disrupted which could harm our operating results 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  growth in our business 
we have made and  although we are currently in a global economic downturn  expect to continue to make significant investments to enable our future growth through  among other things  new product development and clinical trial results for new applications and products 
we must also be prepared to expand our workforce and to train  motivate and manage additional employees as the need for additional personnel arises 
our personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
any failure to effectively manage future growth could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if our facilities were to experience catastrophic loss  our operations would be seriously harmed 
our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss such as fire  flood or earthquake 
all of our research and development activities  manufacturing  our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults in mountain view  california 
any such loss at any of our facilities could disrupt our operations  delay production  shipments and revenue and result in large expense to repair and replace our facilities 
we may need additional capital  which may not be available and our ability to grow may be limited as a result 
we believe that our existing cash balances  available for sale securities  credit facilities and cash flow expected to be generated from future operations  will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements at least through the next months 
however  we may be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding prior to that time 
the development and marketing of new products and associated support personnel requires a significant commitment of resources 
if cash from available sources is insufficient  we may need additional capital  which may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
any inability to raise additional capital when we require it would seriously harm our business 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile and an investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value 
the trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including quarterly variations in our operating results  announcements by us or our competitors of new products or of significant clinical achievements  changes in market valuations of other similar companies in our industry and general market conditions 
we receive only limited attention by securities analyst and may experience an imbalance between supply and demand for our common stock resulting from low trading volumes 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme volatility in the last few years that has often been unrelated to the performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations could have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock regardless of our performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative disclosures we are exposed to market risks inherent in our operations  primarily related to interest rate risk and currency risk 
these risks arise from transactions and operations entered into in the normal course of business 
we do not use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of our marketable securities or our debt instruments 
we have no holdings of derivative or commodity instruments 
interest rate risk 
we are subject to interest rate risks on cash and cash equivalents  available for sale marketable securities and any future financing requirements 
interest rate risks related to marketable securities are managed by managing maturities in our marketable securities portfolio 
we have no long term debt as of december  the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates since the marketable securities maturities do not exceed fiscal year and the interest rates are primarily fixed 
qualitative disclosures interest rate risk 
our primary interest rate risk exposures relate to the available for sale securities will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund future operations 
we have the ability to hold at least a portion of the fixed income investments until maturity and therefore would not expect the operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on its short and long term marketable securities portfolio 
management evaluates its financial position on an ongoing basis 
currency rate risk 
we do not hedge any balance sheet exposures against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
the exposure related to currency rate movements would not have a material impact on future net income or cash flows
