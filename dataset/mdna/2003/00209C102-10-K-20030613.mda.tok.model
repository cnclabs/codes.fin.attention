business trends sales and margins have been under pressure as demand for temporary nurses is currently going through a period of contraction 
hospitals are experiencing flat to declining admission rates and are placing greater reliance on full time staff overtime and increased nurse patient loads 
because of difficult economic times  nurses in many households are becoming the primary breadwinner  causing them to seek more traditional full time employment 
the us department of health and human services said in a july report that the national supply of full time equivalent registered nurses was estimated at million and demand was estimated at million 
the percent gap between the supply of nurses and vacancies in is expected to grow to percent by and then to percent five years later 
as the economy rebounds  the prospects for the medical staffing industry should improve as hospitals experience higher admission rates and increasing shortages of healthcare workers 
critical accounting policies management s discussion in this item addresses the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  workers compensation  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company determines a need for a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
the company believes the following are its most critical accounting policies in that they are the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments allowance for doubtful accounts the company regularly monitors and assesses its risk of not collecting amounts owed to it by its customers 
this evaluation is based upon an analysis of amounts currently and past due along with relevant history and facts particular to the customer 
based upon the results of this analysis  the company records an allowance for uncollectible accounts for this risk 
this analysis requires the company to make significant estimates  and changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts
