item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section presents a review of lakeland bancorp  inc s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
you should read this section in conjunction with the consolidated financial data that is presented on the preceding page as well as the accompanying notes to financial statements 
as used in the following discussion  the term company refers to lakeland bancorp  inc  and lakeland refers to lakeland bank  the company s wholly owned banking subsidiary 
the national bank of sussex county nbsc was merged into lakeland on june   and metropolitan state bank metropolitan was merged into lakeland on january  statements regarding forward looking information the information disclosed in this document includes various forward looking statements that are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of with respect to credit quality including delinquency trends and the allowance for loan and lease losses  corporate objectives  and other financial and business matters 
the words anticipates  projects  intends  estimates  expects  believes  plans  may  will  should  could  and other similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
the company cautions that these forward looking statements are necessarily speculative and speak only as of the date made  and are subject to numerous assumptions  risks and uncertainties  all of which may change over time 
actual results could differ materially from such forward looking statements 
in addition to the factors disclosed by the company elsewhere in this document  the following factors  among others  could cause the company s actual results to differ materially and adversely from such forward looking statements pricing pressures on loan and deposit products  competition  changes in economic conditions nationally  regionally and in the company s markets  the extent and timing of actions of the federal reserve board  changes in levels of market interest rates  clients acceptance of the company s products and services  credit risks of lending activities and competitive factors  whether or not the company ultimately receives payment of all amounts due from the lease portfolio as described in note commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  and the extent and timing of legislative and regulatory actions and reforms 
the above listed risk factors are not necessarily exhaustive  particularly as to possible future events  and new risk factors may emerge from time to time 
certain events may occur that could cause the company s actual results to be materially different than those described in the company s periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission 
any statements made by the company that are not historical facts should be considered to be forward looking statements 
the company is not obligated to update and does not undertake to update any of its forward looking statements made herein 
significant accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company and lakeland conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and predominant practices within the banking industry 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  lakeland  lakeland investment corp  and lakeland nj investment corp 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions also affect reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant estimates implicit in these financial statements are as follows 
the principal estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses includes  among other factors  an analysis of historical loss rates  by category  applied to current loan totals 
however  actual losses may be higher or lower than historical trends  which vary 
actual losses on specified problem loans  which also are provided for in the evaluation  may vary from estimated loss percentages  which are established based upon a limited number of potential loss classifications 

table of contents the allowance for loan and lease losses is established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense 
loan principal considered to be uncollectible by management is charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the allowance is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
the evaluation takes into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and size of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  specific problem loans  and current economic conditions which may affect the borrowers ability to pay 
the evaluation also details historical losses by loan category  the resulting loss rates for which are projected at current loan total amounts 
loss estimates for specified problem loans are also detailed 
interest income is accrued as earned on a simple interest basis 
accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful 
when a loan is placed on such non accrual status  all accumulated accrued interest receivable applicable to periods prior to the current year is charged off to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
interest which had accrued in the current year is reversed out of current period income 
loans days or more past due and still accruing interest must have both principal and accruing interest adequately secured and must be in the process of collection 
the company accounts for impaired loans in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that as a practical expedient  a creditor may measure impairment based on a loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
regardless of the measurement method  a creditor must measure impairment based on the fair value of the collateral when the creditor determines that foreclosure is probable 
the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse 
deferred tax expense is the result of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the principal types of differences between assets and liabilities for financial statement and tax return purposes are allowance for loan losses  deferred loan fees  deferred compensation and securities available for sale 
financial overview the year ended december  represented a year of record growth for the company in many areas

net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets and the cost of funds supporting those assets 
the company s net interest income is determined by i the volume of interest earning assets that it holds and the yields that it earns on those assets  and ii the volume of interest bearing liabilities that it has assumed and the rates that it pays on those liabilities 
net interest income increases when the company can use noninterest bearing deposits to fund or support interest earning assets 
net interest income for on a tax equivalent basis was million  representing an increase of million or from the million earned in net interest income for on a tax equivalent basis was million 
net interest income improved from to primarily because earning assets increased by million 
the decline in the company s cost of funds caused by decreases in interest rates also caused net interest income to increase 
an improvement in the company s mix of deposits from higher cost time deposits to lower cost core deposits also improved the company s cost of funds 
core deposits are defined as noninterest bearing deposits and savings and interest bearing transaction accounts

interest income and expense volume rate analysis 
the following table shows the impact that changes in average balances of the company s assets and liabilities and changes in average interest rates have had on the company s net interest income over the past three years 
this information is presented on a tax equivalent basis assuming a tax rate 
if a change in interest income or expense is attributable to a change in volume and a change in rate  the amount of the change is allocated proportionately

december  commercial real estate mortgage real estate construction home equity and consumer installment at december   there were no concentrations of loans exceeding of total loans outstanding other than loans that are secured by real estate 
loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other related conditions 
the following table sets forth certain categories of loans as of december   in terms of contractual maturity due in thousands within one year after one but within five years after five years total types of loans commercial real estate construction total amount of such loans with predetermined rates floating or adjustable rates total 
table of contents risk elements commercial loans are placed on a non accrual status with all accrued interest and unpaid interest reversed if a because of the deterioration in the financial position of the borrower they are maintained on a cash basis which means payments are applied when and as received rather than on a regularly scheduled basis  b payment in full of interest or principal is not expected  or c principal and interest has been in default for a period of days or more unless the obligation is both well secured and in process of collection 
residential mortgage loans are placed on non accrual status at the time when foreclosure proceedings are commenced except where there exists sufficient collateral to cover the defaulted principal and interest payments  and management s knowledge of the specific circumstances warrant continued accrual 
consumer loans are generally charged off when principal and interest payments are four months in arrears 
interest thereafter on such charged off consumer loans is taken into income when received only after full recovery of principal 
the following schedule sets forth certain information regarding the company s non accrual  past due and renegotiated loans and other real estate owned as of december  for each of the last five years december  in thousands non performing loans non accrual loans a renegotiated loans b total non performing loans other real estate owned total non performing assets non performing assets as a percent of total assets past due loans c a generally represents loans as to which the payment of interest or principal is in arrears for a period of more than ninety days 
current policy requires that interest previously accrued on these loans and not yet paid be reversed and charged against interest income during the current period 
b the loan portfolio includes loans whose terms have been renegotiated due to financial difficulties of borrowers 
all such loans are reviewed quarterly to determine if they are performing in accordance with the renegotiated terms 
c represents loans as to which payments of interest or principal are contractually past due ninety days or more  but which are currently accruing income at the contractually stated rates 
a determination is made to continue accruing income on such loans only if collection of the debt is proceeding in due course and collection efforts are reasonably expected to result in repayment of the debt or in its restoration to a current status 
non accrual loans increased from million at december  to million on december  as a result of million in commercial lease pools being placed on non accrual in surety companies have issued bonds to cover the performance of these leases but have withheld payment 
the company is presently litigating this matter 
for more information  please see note commitments and contingencies litigation 
there is a loan relationship with a balance of million and a loan relationship with a balance of  in non accrual loans at december  there are no other loan relationships on non accrual with balances exceeding  excluding the impact of the commercial leases on performing assets  non performing assets would have been million or of total assets on december  all non accrual loans are in various stages of litigation  foreclosure  or workout 
loans past due ninety days or more and still accruing remained substantially the same at million on december  compared to year end 
table of contents for  the gross interest income that would have been recorded  had the loans classified at year end as non accrual been performing in conformance with their original loan terms  is approximately million 
the amount of interest income actually recorded on those loans for was  the resultant income loss of million for compares to gains of  and losses of  for and  respectively 
loans specifically evaluated are deemed impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements 
loans which are in process of collection will not be classified as impaired 
a loan is not impaired during the process of collection of payment if the company expects to collect all amounts due  including interest accrued at the contractual interest rate 
all commercial loans identified as impaired in excess of  are evaluated by an independent loan review consultant 
the company aggregates consumer loans and residential mortgages for evaluation purposes 
the company s policy concerning non accrual loans states that  except for loans which are considered to be fully collectible by virtue of collateral held and in the process of collection  loans are placed on a non accrual status when payments are days delinquent or more 
it is possible for a loan to be on non accrual status and not be classified as impaired if the balance of such loan is relatively small and  therefore  that loan has not been specifically reviewed for impairment 
loans  or portions thereof  are charged off in the period that the loss is identified 
until such time  an allowance for loan loss is maintained for estimated losses 
with regard to interest income recognition for payments received on impaired loans  as well as all non accrual loans  the company follows regulatory guidelines  which apply any payments to principal as long as there is doubt as to the collectibility of the loan balance 
as of december   based on the above criteria  the company had impaired loans totaling million including million in non accrual loans 
the impairment of these loans is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral for these loans 
based upon such evaluation  million has been allocated to the allowance for loan and lease losses for impairment 
at december   the company also had million in loans that were rated substandard that were not classified as non performing or impaired 
there were no loans at december   other than those designated non performing  impaired or substandard where the company was aware of any credit conditions of any borrowers that would indicate a strong possibility of the borrowers not complying with the present terms and conditions of repayment and which may result in such loans being included as non accrual  past due or renegotiated at a future date 
the following table sets forth for each of the five years ended december   the historical relationships among the amount of loans outstanding  the allowance for loan and lease losses  the provision for loan and lease losses  the amount of loans charged off and the amount of loan recoveries

the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the periodic provisioning for estimated losses included in the consolidated financial statements is the responsibility of management 
the evaluation process is undertaken on a quarterly basis 
methodology employed for assessing the adequacy of the allowance consists of the following criteria the establishment of reserve amounts for all specifically identified criticized loans that have been designated as requiring attention by the company s external loan review program 
the establishment of reserves for pools of homogeneous types of loans not subject to specific review  including family residential mortgages  and consumer loans 
the establishment of reserve amounts for the non criticized loans in each portfolio based upon the historical average loss experience for these portfolios 
consideration is given to the results of ongoing credit quality monitoring processes  the adequacy and expertise of the company s lending staff  underwriting policies  loss histories  delinquency trends  and the cyclical nature of economic and business conditions 
since many of the company s loans depend on the sufficiency of collateral as a secondary source of repayment  any adverse trend in the real estate markets could affect underlying values available to protect the company from loss 
based upon the process employed and giving recognition to all accompanying factors related to the loan portfolio  management considers the allowance for loan and lease losses to be adequate at december  the preceding statement constitutes a forward looking statement within the meaning of that term set forth in rule of the securities act of and rule of the securities exchange act of 
table of contents the following table shows how the allowance for loan and lease losses is allocated among the various types of loans that the company has outstanding 
this allocation is based on management s specific review of the credit risk of the outstanding loans in each category as well as historical trends

lakeland has overnight federal funds lines available for it to borrow up to million 
lakeland s management believes that its current level of liquidity is sufficient to meet its current and anticipated operational needs including current loan commitments  deposit maturities and other obligations 
this constitutes a forward looking statement under the private securities litigation reform act of actual results could differ materially from anticipated results due to a variety of factors  including uncertainties relating to general economic conditions  unanticipated decreases in deposits  changes in or failure to comply with governmental regulations  and uncertainties relating to the analysis of the company s assessment of rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities and relating to the extent to which market factors indicate that a financial institution such as lakeland should match such assets and liabilities 

table of contents the following table sets forth contractual obligations and other commitments representing required and potential cash outflows as of december dollars in thousands total within one year after one but within three after three but within five years after five years minimum annual rentals or noncancellable operating leases benefit plan commitments remaining contractual maturities of time deposits loan commitments long term borrowed funds standby letters of credit total interest rate risk closely related to the concept of liquidity is the concept of interest rate sensitivity ie  the extent to which assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is often measured by the extent to which mismatches or gaps occur in the repricing of assets and liabilities within a given time period 
gap analysis is utilized to quantify such mismatches 
a positive gap results when the amount of earning assets repricing within a given time period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities repricing within that time period 
a negative gap results when the amount of interest bearing liabilities repricing within a given time period exceeds the amount of earning assets repricing within such time period 
in general  a financial institution with a positive gap in relevant time periods will benefit from an increase in market interest rates and will experience erosion in net interest income if such rates fall 
likewise  a financial institution with a negative gap in relevant time periods will normally benefit from a decrease in market interest rates and will be adversely affected by an increase in rates 
by maintaining a balanced interest rate sensitivity position  where interest rate sensitive assets roughly equal interest sensitive liabilities in relevant time periods  interest rate risk can be limited 
as a financial institution  the company s potential interest rate volatility is a primary component of its market risk 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of the company s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
based upon the company s nature of operations  the company is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the company does not own any trading assets and does not have any hedging transactions in place  such as interest rate swaps and caps 
the company s board of directors has adopted an asset liability policy designed to stabilize net interest income and preserve capital over a broad range of interest rate movements 
this policy outlines guidelines and ratios dealing with  among others  liquidity  volatile liability dependence  investment portfolio composition  loan portfolio composition  loan to deposit ratio and gap analysis ratio 
the company s performance as compared to the asset liability policy is monitored by its board of directors 
in addition  to effectively administer the asset liability policy and to monitor exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  the company maintains an asset liability committee  consisting of the chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief lending officer  chief retail officer and certain other senior officers 
this committee meets quarterly to review the company s financial results and to develop strategies to implement the asset liability policy and to respond to market conditions 
the company monitors and controls interest rate risk through a variety of techniques  including use of traditional interest rate sensitivity analysis also known as gap analysis and an interest rate risk management model 
with the interest rate risk management model  the company projects future net interest income  and then estimates the effect of various changes in interest rates and balance sheet growth rates on that projected net interest 
table of contents income 
the company also uses the interest rate risk management model to calculate the change in net portfolio value over a range of interest rate change scenarios 
traditional gap analysis involves arranging the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities by repricing periods and then computing the difference or interest rate sensitivity gap between the assets and liabilities that are estimated to reprice during each time period and cumulatively through the end of each time period 
both interest rate sensitivity modeling and gap analysis are done at a specific point in time and involve a variety of significant estimates and assumptions 
interest rate sensitivity modeling requires  among other things  estimates of how much and when yields and costs on individual categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities will respond to general changes in market rates  future cash flows and discount rates 
gap analysis requires estimates as to when individual categories of interest sensitive assets and liabilities will reprice  and assumes that assets and liabilities assigned to the same repricing period will reprice at the same time and in the same amount 
gap analysis does not account for the fact that repricing of assets and liabilities is discretionary and subject to competitive and other pressures 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity repricing structure of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  except as stated below  the amounts of assets or liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of each asset or liability 
the majority of interest bearing demand deposits and savings deposits are assumed to be core deposits  or deposits that will generally remain at the company regardless of market interest rates 
therefore  of the core interest bearing deposits and of core savings deposits are shown as maturing or repricing within three months 
the remainder is divided between the after but within years column and the after years column 
interest bearing transaction accounts held by states and municipalities are seen to be more sensitive than personal interest bearing transaction accounts 
therefore  of public interest bearing transaction accounts are shown as repricing within three months 
the table does not assume any prepayment of fixed rate loans 
the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities  for example  prepayments of loans and withdrawal of deposits  is beyond the company s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within a stated period may in fact reprice at different times and at different rate levels

therefore  these techniques may not accurately reflect the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income or net portfolio value 
because of the limitations in the gap analysis discussed above  members of the company s asset liability management committee believe that the interest sensitivity modeling more accurately reflects the effects and exposure to changes in interest rates 
net interest income simulation considers the relative sensitivities of the balance sheet including the effects of interest rate caps on adjustable rate mortgages and the relatively stable aspects of core deposits 
as such  net interest income simulation is designed to address the probability of interest rate changes and the behavioral response of the balance sheet to those changes 
market value of portfolio equity represents the fair value of the net present value of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items 
the starting point or base case for the following table is an estimate of the company s net portfolio value at december  using current discount rates  and an estimate of net interest income for assuming that both interest rates and the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities remain at december  levels 
the rate shock information in the table shows estimates of net portfolio value at december  and net interest income for assuming fluctuations or rate shocks of plus and basis points and minus and basis points 
rate shocks assume that current interest rates change immediately

the federal reserve board has adopted a similar risk based capital guideline for the company which is computed on a consolidated basis 
in addition  the bank regulators have adopted minimum leverage ratio guidelines tier i capital to average quarterly assets  less goodwill for financial institutions 
these guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of for financial institutions that meet certain specified criteria  including that they have the highest regulatory rating 
all other holding companies are required to maintain a leverage ratio of plus an additional cushion of at least to basis points

to have a significant effect on the company s results of operations 
effects of inflation the impact of inflation  as it affects banks  differs substantially from the impact on non financial institutions 
banks have assets which are primarily monetary in nature and which tend to move with inflation 
this is especially true for banks with a high percentage of rate sensitive interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
a bank can further reduce the impact of inflation with proper management of its rate sensitivity gap 
this gap represents the difference between interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities 
lakeland attempts to structure its assets and liabilities and manage its gap to protect against substantial changes in interest rate scenarios  thus minimizing the potential effects of inflation
