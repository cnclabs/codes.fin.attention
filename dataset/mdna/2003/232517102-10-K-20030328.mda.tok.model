item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview our operations during the past three years have been most significantly influenced by market conditions in the electronics and semiconductor fabrication capital equipment markets 
these markets have historically been very cyclical with periods of strong growth followed by periods of excess capacity and reduced capital spending 
during  these markets experienced high growth rates and reached record volume levels 
however  in early the electronics capital equipment markets experienced a significant decline that has continued through our operating results have been heavily impacted by these market conditions  particularly our electronic assembly sensor and semiconductor product lines 
consequently  consolidated revenues have declined to million from their peak of million in in response to declining revenues  we have taken aggressive cost reduction actions during and  including reducing our worldwide employment by over from peaks  and closing or downsizing facilities 
nevertheless  in order to continue new product development initiatives required to maintain our competitive position in the marketplace  as well as to continue to support existing products  we were not able to reduce our expense structure to keep pace with the dramatic reduction in revenue levels 
in addition  during we determined that based on accounting guidance we were required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  eliminating a significant portion of the tax benefit that would be recorded against pre tax losses 
these events contributed to a net loss of million for the year ended december our cash and marketable securities are million at december  compared to million at december  we used million of cash in  primarily as the result of million of losses 
during the second half of  our cash usage rate from operations was substantially reduced due to higher revenue levels compared to the first half of and a reduced expense structure resulting from our cost reduction actions in the second quarter 
we believe that cash reserves are sufficient to fund operations and investments in new product development initiatives even if the current depressed market condition in the electronics and semiconductor capital equipment markets is prolonged 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate estimates  including those related to bad debts  warranty obligations  inventory valuation  intangible assets  income taxes  and restructuring costs 
management bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the estimates and judgments that we believe have the most effect on our reported financial position and results of operations are as follows allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is  as of december  allowance for warranty expenses 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers  warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
the provision for warranties is  at december  reserve for inventory obsolescence 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
at december   we had a provision for obsolete and excess inventory of approximately million 
valuation of intangible and long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors management considers important  which could trigger an impairment review include the following o significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  o significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  o significant negative industry or economic trends  o significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  and the company s market capitalization relative to net book value 
o for intangible assets and long lived assets  if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows from such asset 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any potential impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that we believe is commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
deferred tax assets 
when we incur a net loss that cannot be carried back and applied to taxes in prior years  we record as an asset the benefit that the loss may generate as an offset to future taxes 
nevertheless  when we record losses over a prolonged period and our ability to generate income in the future becomes more doubtful  we are required to record a valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and the need for this valuation allowance on statement of financial accounting standards no 
because of the us based operating losses we have incurred over the past three years and because of continued weakness in the markets we serve that has impacted the order rates for our products  we reduced the current tax benefit recorded during the year ended december  by recording a non cash valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we do not expect to record tax expense or benefits on us based operating results nominal tax provision expected for foreign operating results until we are consistently profitable on a quarterly basis 
at that time  the valuation allowance will be reassessed and could be eliminated  resulting in the recognition of the deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance provided against deferred tax assets is approximately million at december   an increase of approximately million over the balance at december  results of operations for the three years ended december  revenues our revenues decreased by to million in from million in  and decreased by in from million in the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  revenues by product line oem solutions electronic assembly sensors    semiconductor products    smt systems    total    revenues from our electronic assembly sensors products decreased million or during compared to  and decreased million or during compared to during  revenues from electronic assembly sensors  primarily our laseralign sensors  were negatively impacted by the continuation of depressed market conditions in the worldwide market for smt capital equipment 
this slowdown began in the first half of and has continued throughout the market impact was compounded by the relatively large inventory of laseralign sensors that had been accumulated by our two principal customers during  resulting in virtually no new orders from those customers during the second half and early in the second and third quarters of  these two customers began ordering new sensors  but the order rates were depressed by overall weakness in the smt capital equipment markets 
in contrast  during  revenues for electronic assembly sensors grew dramatically as the worldwide markets for electronic circuit boards with surface mount components experienced high levels of growth 
revenues from semiconductor products including revenues from imagenation frame grabber products for semiconductor and other applications decreased  or in compared to  following a decrease of million or in compared to the decrease in was primarily the result of lower revenues from wafer mapping sensors sold to the semiconductor fabrication capital equipment market  reflecting continued market weakness 
revenues from products developed by imagenation for broader industrial application were flat in compared to the decrease in compared to was attributed to a sharp decline in demand for semiconductor fabrication capital equipment beginning early in and is consistent with the decline in the overall electronics market 
the revenue decrease was comprised of a million or decrease in revenue from sales of products developed by hama primarily wafer mapping sensors  partially offset by a million or increase in revenues from products developed by imagenation acquired in october 
the increase in revenues from imagenation resulted from the periods during which revenues were included in our consolidated results twelve months operations in versus two months operations in 
the decrease in semiconductor product revenue was exacerbated by the loss of revenue from industrial measurement product lines that were divested in  which accounted for million of revenue in revenues from our smt systems products decreased million or during compared to during revenues from smt systems  primarily our se solder paste inspection systems  suffered from the same  market conditions as our other product groups 
despite the severe market downturn in  smt systems revenues increased million or during compared to  following an increase of million or during compared to smt systems revenue declines have not been as significant as in our other product groups due to new product introductions and the success of those products in a depressed market 
the se and the ks series products generated initial revenue in the fourth quarter of the market acceptance of these products  particularly the se  have allowed for relatively modest revenue declines in a severely depressed market 
we believe that increasing use of electronic manufacturing services ems companies for circuit board assembly  production difficulties associated with smaller component sizes and increased production speeds and increased cost pressure on companies manufacturing circuit boards has caused demand for our inspection equipment to remain relatively stable 
international revenue totaled million in  million in and million in  comprising  and of total revenue  respectively 
the international markets of europe  japan and the rest of asia account for a significant portion of the production capability of capital equipment for the manufacture of electronics  the primary market for our eas sensor and smt system product lines 
gross margin gross margin decreased to of sales in from in and in gross margin is highly dependent on the level of revenues and resulting production levels over which to spread fixed manufacturing costs such as facilities and other compensation and non compensation expenses that do not vary with activity levels 
in addition  with higher production volumes  manufacturing processes become more efficient and reduce the overall cost of producing products for sale 
revenue levels declined in compared to and declined in compared to  and although we have reduced costs as part of cost reduction actions  the magnitude of the revenue declines have had a significant impact on gross margin 
the mix of products we sell also has an impact on gross margins as a percentage of sales 
during  our gross margins were lower because our sales included a higher proportion of end user systems products 
the higher production costs associated with introduction of new smt systems products as well as price pressure we have encountered as multiple equipment suppliers compete for fewer sales opportunities  have negatively impacted our gross margins on end user systems products 
in addition  we decided in the third quarter of to discontinue  over time  the sales of certain older version smt systems  and as a result increased reserves for obsolete inventory of these older systems 
there can be no assurance that selling prices for end user system products will fully recover when the electronic assembly market improves 
in addition  we are beginning to experience price pressure in our other product lines  as production equipment suppliers to the electronic assembly market primary customers for eas sensors come under competitive price pressure and attempt to reduce the cost of their machines 
we expect to see modest improvement in gross margin in as revenue levels increase and cost reduction measures are implemented 
research and development expenses we reduced our research and development expenses in by to million  and reduced those expenses by to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses increased to in  compared to in and in the reduction in research and development expenses is primarily the result of cost reduction initiatives implemented during and research and development expenses were maintained at relatively high levels during the first half of as cyberoptics continued to fund several new product development initiatives on important new products even as revenues levels were significantly lower than the prior year 
during the second quarter of cost reduction measures were initiated through a work force reduction that significantly reduced research and development expenses 
in addition  expenses were significantly impacted by a reduction in customer funded research and development 
during customer funded research and development  recognized as a reduction in expense  was million compared to million in the decrease in research and development expense in compared to was primarily the result of cost reduction measures implemented during and increased customer funded research and development million in compared to  in 
these reductions were partially offset by the full year impact of the acquisition of imagenation 
during and  research and development efforts were primarily focused on continued development of the se and ks series inspection systems  next generation laseralign products  board alignment and on head linescan cameras and enhancements to the semiconductor wafer mapping sensor product family 
during  research and development expenses also included initial development activities for several new sensor and systems products 
we expect that the dollar level of research and development expenses during will continue to moderately decrease compared to as we realize the full year impact of cost reductions implemented over the last two years 
selling  general and administrative expenses we reduced our selling  general and administrative expenses by to million in  compared to million in our selling general and administrative expenses increased in compared to million in as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses were in  in and in the dollar decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in was primarily due to cost reduction measures implemented in and  which primarily included workforce reductions and related costs 
the dollar increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in  was primarily due to personnel and marketing investments made to develop the end user sales and service channel including the costs of opening and operating a singapore sales office in may to better serve asian markets  and the full year impact of the imagenation acquisitions  partially offset by cost reduction measures taken in the second half of and reduced selling commissions and performance bonuses 
acquired in process research and development and other restructuring expenses in and  we implemented four see below workforce reductions and restructurings designed to reduce the losses and negative cash flow resulting from the severe decline in revenues 
two of these actions were completed in and two were completed in in january  we incurred approximately  of severance costs associated with cost reduction measures 
cost reduction measures included a workforce reduction  discretionary spending reductions  and the consolidation of semiconductor product manufacturing in portland  oregon 
severance costs were associated with a workforce reduction of people 
approximately  of these costs were paid as of december  facility exit and severance costs of  were accrued as of december  and all were paid in january  when we bought out the remaining obligations under the lease 
in june  we incurred approximately  of severance and related costs associated with cost reduction measures 
cost reduction measures included a workforce reduction  and discretionary spending reductions 
severance costs were associated with a workforce reduction of people 
approximately  of these costs were paid as of december  severance costs of approximately  were accrued as of december   and will be substantially paid over the next six months 
in april  we incurred approximately  of severance related costs associated with cost reduction measures 
in september  the company incurred approximately  of additional severance related costs associated with a second round of cost reduction measures 
a total of and employees were terminated in april and september  respectively 
substantially all of these costs were paid as of december  on october   we acquired imagenation corporation imagenation 
at the time of acquisition  imagenation had two products under development 
the first was a new generation of frame grabber pxr  formerly bluebird that contains features that greatly exceed the performance of prior frame grabber products sold by the company 
the second is a machine vision product concept that  if successfully developed  will integrate all vision components on a single circuit board visioncell tm  to be used as a wafer mapper primarily in a semiconductor manufacturing environment and other potential applications 
we recorded a million charge to operations for the estimated fair value of the acquired in process research and development 
this charge was not deductible  for income tax reporting purposes 
we introduced the pxr frame grabber late in the second quarter of  and development of the visioncell technology for wafer mapper applications has been discontinued due to the determination that there was not a significant market advantage over the laser based wafer mapping products we sell 
development of the visioncell technology for other potential applications continued in during the fourth quarter of  we made a decision to abandon the development of the firstcheck tm product line  acquired from electronic packaging co  using technology originally acquired in accordingly  intangible assets with a net book value of  were deemed to be permanently impaired and were written off 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets was approximately million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in amortization during is attributed to the adoption of the goodwill non amortization provisions of fas which eliminated the systematic amortization of the approximately million balance of goodwill 
without the impact of adoption of fas  amortization of intangible assets would have been approximately million in the increase in amortization in  compared to  is the result of the acquisition of imagenation corporation during the fourth quarter of amortization is primarily attributable to developed technology  patents and trademarks resulting from our acquisition of technology and other assets of kestra ltd 
and hama laboratories inc during the second quarter of and our acquisition of imagenation corporation 
amortization of these intangible assets is expected to be approximately million in effective tax rate we recorded a tax benefit of million in resulting in an effective income tax rate of 
the effective tax rate was substantially lower than the us statutory tax rate of primarily as the result of establishing a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets during the third quarter of see disclosure in critical accounting policies and estimates and the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
the tax benefit and effective income tax benefit rate in were impacted by establishing valuation allowances of approximately million  offsetting deferred tax assets that require future taxable income to be realized 
of the million valuation allowance established in  million represents deferred tax assets established in prior years with the balance reflecting deferred tax assets generated as the result of taxable losses 
we recorded a tax benefit of million in  resulting in an effective tax benefit rate of 
the effective tax rate was higher than the us statutory rate of primarily as a result of foreign sales corporation benefits and research and development tax credits 
these benefits were partially offset by non deductible goodwill amortization  and valuation allowances established to eliminate the future tax benefit of net operating loss carry forwards generated by cyberoptics uk  ltd 
formerly kestra following the acquisition due to uncertainty about realization 
we recorded a tax provision of million in resulting in an effective rate of 
the effective tax rate was higher than the us statutory tax rate of  primarily as a result of the non deductible  in process research and development write off resulting from the imagenation acquisition  non deductible goodwill amortization and valuation allowances established to eliminate the future tax benefit of net operating loss carry forwards generated by cyberoptics uk  ltd 
these items were partially offset by foreign sales corporation benefits and research and development tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased approximately million to million as of december  from million as of december   primarily because of the million of cash we used in operations and the million of we cash used for acquisitions of capital assets and loans to a related party 
these sources of cash were partially offset by  of cash we generated from common stock related activity 
we used million of cash from operations during  primarily due to a net loss of million  which included million of non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization  provisions for inventory obsolescence  equity in losses of avanti  establishing a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and other non cash items 
cash used by operations included a million increase in accounts receivable  a  decrease in accounts payable and a  increase in taxes receivable 
the increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to growing revenues and the decrease in accounts payable is primarily due to reduced inventory purchases and operating expenses 
the increase in taxes receivable were the result of tax losses in which will be collected as a refund from taxes paid in prior years  offset by tax refunds of approximately million received in these items were offset somewhat by  of inventory reductions and by an increase of  in accrued expenses 
reduced inventory is primarily the result of increased revenue in the second half of and increased accrued expenses are primarily due to approximately  of facility and severance costs associated with workforce reductions and other cost reduction measures implemented in we generated million of cash from operations in  due primarily to a million reduction in accounts receivable partially offset by a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses  a million increase in inventories  and a million increase in taxes receivable and deferred taxes 
the net loss of million in  was more than offset by non cash charges of million for depreciation and amortization  the provision for inventory obsolescence and the provision for doubtful accounts 
we generated million of cash in investing activities during compared to using million in cash used in investing activities in includes million for loans to related parties and  for the acquisition of fixed assets and capitalized patent costs 
these uses were more than offset by net maturities of marketable securities that generated approximately million in cash used in investing activities in includes million for acquired technology including million paid for certain intellectual property and a software license  million for acquired fixed assets and the net purchase of an additional million of marketable securities 
we generated  of cash from financing activities in  and generated million in during and  all of the cash was generated by common stock related transactions  primarily stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan share purchases 
we used  to repurchase common stock in the fourth quarter of in october  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of common stock 
the shares will be repurchased from time to time in the open market or through negotiated transactions 
shares repurchased will be used for employee compensation plans and other corporate purposes 
except for the share repurchase program discussed above  we had no material commitments for expenditures as of december  while there were no material commitments  we evaluate investment opportunities that come to our attention and could make a significant commitment in the future 
our cash and equivalents and investments totaled million at december  with this level of cash and cash equivalents  and the reduced level of cash expenditures resulting from higher revenue in the second half of and the last workforce reduction in june  we believe that cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund our cash flow needs for at least months  even if the severity of the downturn in the electronics capital equipment industries continues unabated 
if the economic conditions appear to be continuing or worsening over the next year  we may seek bank financing or make other adjustments in expense levels 
at december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of establishing off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we do not believe we are exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
the following summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
less than after december in s total year years years contractual obligations borrowings non cancelable operating lease obligations    total contractual cash obligations    related party transactions on april   we loaned million to avanti optics corporation avanti  a company founded by steven k 
case  our chairman  founder and a significant shareholder of cyberoptics 
erwin kelen  one of our directors  also serves as director of avanti  is a shareholder in avanti  and is a representative of one of the principal venture capital investors in avanti 
we held approximately of the outstanding capital stock of avanti prior to the loan  which we had acquired in consideration of the contribution of  cash and intellectual property to avanti when avanti was formed 
the loan transaction was approved by our board of directors without the participation of dr 
case or mr 
kelen and only after a determination that the loan was in our best interests 
the loan was represented by a convertible promissory note that bears interest at above the prime rate of interest and was repayable on april   or upon an earlier event of default 
the loan was secured by all of the intellectual property of avanti consisting primarily of rights in united states patents and patent applications in the area of photonics component manufacture  and provided us with the exclusive rights to manufacture and distribute manual and semi automated equipment for the assembly of surface mountable optical components that were under development by avanti 
during  we reduced the carrying value of the term loan by  to reflect our equity in the cumulative losses of avanti and to reduce our investment to reflect its net realizable value as of december  in december  we were notified that  as a result of not being able to raise additional third party funding  avanti decided to cease operations and liquidate its remaining assets 
in february  avanti s board of directors and its significant shareholders passed a resolution to cease business operations 
consequently  all of the avanti intellectual property rights were transferred to us under the terms of the loan 
at december   the carrying value of the loan is  and reflects the estimated book value of assets that we will receive in the avanti liquidation inflation and foreign currency translation our revenue has declined during the past three years primarily because of decreases in the level of unit shipments resulting from a down turn in the worldwide electronics capital equipment market 
we believe that inflation has not had any significant effect on our operations 
all of our international export sales are negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars 
accordingly  although currency fluctuations do not significantly affect our revenue and income per unit  they can influence the price competitiveness of our products and the willingness of existing and potential customers to purchase units 
as a result of the kestra acquisition  we have a sales and software development office located in the uk 
we also opened a sales office in singapore during the year 
we do not believe that currency fluctuations will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting developments in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations which provides accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  management believes the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets the statement 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement also eliminates the exception to the consolidation of a subsidiary for which control is likely to be temporary 
the company adopted the statement on january  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on either the financial position or operating results of the company 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition disclosure an amendment of fas sfas no 

this statement amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require prominent disclosures in both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december   and disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods beginning after december  we intend to continue to account for stock based compensation to our employees and directors using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb opinion no 
 and related interpretations 
we have made certain disclosures required by sfas no 
in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and will begin making the additional disclosures required by sfas no 
in the first quarter of accordingly  adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosure requirements in the financial statements concerning obligations under certain guarantees 
it also clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of liabilities by a guarantor at the inception of certain guarantees 
the disclosure requirements of this interpretation were effective for us on december  but did not require any additional disclosure 
the recognition provisions of the interpretation are applicable only to guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not expect adoption of these recognition provisions to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation addresses the requirements for business enterprises to consolidate related entities in which they are the determined to be the primary beneficiary as a result of their variable economic interests 
the interpretation is intended to provide guidance in judging multiple economic interests in an entity and in determining the primary beneficiary 
the interpretation outlines disclosure requirements for variable interest entities in existence prior to january  and outlines consolidation requirements for variable interest entities created after january  we do not expect adoption of these consolidation provisions to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest excess funds not required for current operations in marketable securities 
the investment policy for these marketable securities is approved annually by the board of directors and administered by management 
a third party  approved by our board of directors  manages the portfolio at the direction of management 
the investment policy dictates that marketable securities consist of us government or us government agency securities or certain approved corporate instruments with maturities of three years or less and an average portfolio maturity of not more that months 
as of december  our portfolio of marketable securities had an average term to maturity of approximately one year 
all marketable securities are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value 
we estimate that a hypothetical increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the market value of the portfolio of marketable securities of approximately  if such a rate increase occurred  our net income would only be impacted if securities were sold prior to maturity 
we enter into foreign currency swap agreements to hedge short term inter company financing transactions with our subsidiary in the united kingdom 
these currency swap agreements are structured to mature on the last day of each quarter and are designated as cash flow hedges 
at december   the company had one open swap agreement that was purchased on that date 
as a result  there were no unrealized gains or losses as of december  during the year ended december   we recognized a net loss of approximately  from settlement of foreign currency swap agreements that offset the approximately  translation gain on the underlying inter company balance 
our foreign currency swap agreements contain credit risk to the extent that our bank counter parties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements 
the company minimizes such risk by limiting its counter parties to major financial institutions 
we do not expect material losses as a result of defaults by other parties
