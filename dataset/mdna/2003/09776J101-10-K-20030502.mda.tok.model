item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations fiscal total and comparable store sales of the bon ton stores  inc and all subsidiaries the company decreased compared to fiscal fiscal was a difficult year for retail stores  as merchandise price became an increasingly significant component of consumer buying decisions 
the continued economic downturn and general declining consumer confidence were also major factors adversely impacting retail businesses 
while sales in most stores were below their fiscal level  sales in certain stores performed at a level below the company average 
during fiscal  the company recognized impairment charges against long lived assets at certain of these store sites 
the company will continue to monitor the performance of its stores and initiate operational improvements where possible 
the following table summarizes changes in selected operating indicators of the company  illustrating the relationship of various income and expense items to net sales for each fiscal year presented percent of net sales fiscal year net sales other income  net costs and expenses costs of merchandise sold selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization unusual expense income from operations interest expense  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales were million for fiscal  a decrease of million relative to fiscal total and comparable store sales for fiscal decreased from fiscal merchandise departments recording sales increases were accessories  coats and petites 
merchandise departments reflecting the sharpest sales declines were dresses  children s  men s clothing and intimate 
other income  net net other income  principally income from leased departments  remained constant at of net sales for fiscal and fiscal costs and expenses gross margin dollars for fiscal increased million  or over fiscal  due to an increased margin percentage partially offset by declining sales volume 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  an increase of percentage point from in fiscal gross margin percentage improvement over fiscal reflects increased markup on purchases in fiscal and reserves established for seasonal carryover merchandise in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal fiscal store expense decreased million versus fiscal  primarily due to reduced advertising expense  but reflected an expense rate increase of percentage point due to reduced net sales 
fiscal corporate expense decreased million versus fiscal driving an overall selling  general and administrative expense rate decrease of percentage point 
the decrease in corporate expense principally reflects an increase in securitization income of million from the company s proprietary credit card program and reduced equipment rental costs 
the increased securitization income in fiscal relative to fiscal was principally a reflection of increased sales on the company s proprietary credit card and lower securitization facility costs 
depreciation and amortization increased to of net sales in fiscal from in fiscal partially as a result of a lower sales base and capital expenditures in the amount of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
additionally  in fiscal the company recognized approximately million of impairment losses on the long lived assets of certain stores

gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  down percentage point from in fiscal the gross margin percentage decline was principally due to the increased markdown rate and reserves established for seasonal merchandise in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal fiscal store expense decreased million versus fiscal  but reflected an expense rate increase of percentage point due to reduced fiscal sales 
fiscal corporate expense decreased million versus fiscal  driving an expense rate decrease of percentage point 
the decrease in corporate expense principally reflects increased securitization income of million from the company s proprietary credit card program and reduced payroll costs 
the increased securitization income in fiscal relative to fiscal was principally a reflection of increased sales on the company s proprietary credit card  lower securitization facility costs and higher fee income 
depreciation and amortization increased to of net sales in fiscal from in fiscal partially as a result of a lower sales base and capital expenditures in the amount of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
additionally  in fiscal the company evaluated a store lease renewal option exercisable in january the company decided against exercising this lease option under existing terms and  therefore  accelerated depreciation of million for associated assets with lives exceeding the expected lease term 
unusual expense in fiscal of million  or of net sales  was incurred in the third quarter relating to a workforce reduction and the realignment and elimination of certain senior management positions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
unusual expense in fiscal of million  or of net sales  was incurred due to the early retirement of heywood wilansky as president and chief executive officer  the realignment and elimination of certain senior management positions and a workforce reduction 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
income from operations income from operations in fiscal amounted to million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal interest expense  net net interest expense in fiscal decreased million to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in fiscal the decrease in interest expense was attributable to decreased average borrowing levels and lower interest rates 
income taxes the effective tax rate remained constant at in fiscal and fiscal net income net income in fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes material measures of the company s liquidity and capital resources february  february  february  dollars in millions working capital current ratio debt to total capitalization debt plus equity unused availability under lines of credit the company s primary sources of working capital are cash flows from operations  borrowings under its revolving credit facility and proceeds from its accounts receivable facility 
the company had working capital of million  million and million at the end of fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s business follows a seasonal pattern and working capital fluctuates with seasonal variations  reaching its highest level in october or november 
the increase in working capital at the end of fiscal compared to the end of fiscal was principally due to increased accounts receivable and decreased income taxes payable  partially offset by a reduction in merchandise inventory 
net cash provided by operating activities amounted to million in and million in fiscal and the million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal relative to fiscal was primarily due to increased working capital requirements  partially offset by increased net income and higher depreciation and amortization costs 
net cash used in investing activities amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the net cash outflow in fiscal was the result of capital expenditures in the amount of million  primarily related to store remodeling  information services projects and general operations 
net cash used in financing activities amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the net cash outflow in fiscal was principally attributable to payments on long term debt  a decrease in bank overdrafts and repurchase of the company s common stock 
the company currently anticipates its capital expenditures for fiscal will approximate million 
the expenditures will be directed toward remodeling some of the company s existing stores  information systems enhancements and general operations 
aside from planned capital expenditures  the company s primary cash requirements will be to service debt and finance working capital increases during peak selling seasons 
the company anticipates that its cash balances and cash flows from operations  supplemented by borrowings under the revolving credit facility and proceeds from the accounts receivable facility  will be sufficient to satisfy its operating cash requirements 
the accounts receivable facility and revolving credit facility agreements expire in january and april  respectively 
the company anticipates that it will be able to renew or replace these agreements with agreements of substantially comparable terms 
cash flows from operations are impacted by consumer confidence  weather conditions in the geographic markets served by the company  the economic climate and competitive conditions existing in the retail industry 
a downturn in any single factor or a combination of factors could have a material adverse impact upon the company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to operate its business 
the company has not identified any probable circumstances that would likely impair its ability to meet its cash requirements or trigger a default or acceleration of payment of the company s debt 
the following table reflects the company s major debt and lease commitments payments required by fiscal year there dollars in thousands after total long term debt     short term debt capital leases operating leases        totals        transfers of financial assets the company engages in securitization activities involving the company s proprietary credit card portfolio as a source of funding 
gains and losses from securitizations are recognized in the consolidated statements of income when the company relinquishes control of the transferred financial assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
and other related pronouncements 
the gain or loss on the sale of financial assets depends in part on the previous carrying amount of the assets involved in the transfer  allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based upon their respective fair values at the date of sale 
the company sells undivided percentage ownership interests in certain of its credit card accounts receivable to unrelated third parties under a million accounts receivable securitization facility  which is described in further detail below and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the unrelated third parties  referred to as the conduit  have purchased a million interest in the accounts receivable under this facility at february  the company is responsible for servicing these accounts  retains a servicing fee and bears the risk of non collection limited to its retained interests in the accounts receivable 
associated off balance sheet assets and related debt were million at february  and million at february  upon the facility s termination  the conduit would be entitled to all cash collections on the accounts receivable until its investment million at february  and accrued discounts are repaid 
accordingly  upon termination of the facility  the assets of the facility would not be available to the company until all amounts due to the conduit have been paid in full 
based upon the terms of the accounts receivable facility  the accounts receivable transactions qualify for sale treatment under generally accepted accounting principles 
this treatment requires the company to account for transactions with the conduit as a sale of accounts receivable instead of reflecting the conduit s net investment as long term debt with a pledge of accounts receivable as collateral 
absent this sale treatment  the company s balance sheet would reflect additional accounts receivable and long term debt  which could be a factor in the company s ability to raise capital  however  results of operations would not be significantly impacted 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to merchandise returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  financings  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially lead to materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes its critical accounting policies are described below 
for a discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
the company continually monitors collections and payments from customers and maintains an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon its historical experience  how delinquent accounts ultimately charge off  aging of accounts and any specific customer collection issues identified eg  bankruptcy 
while such credit losses have historically been within expectations and provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past 
if circumstances change eg  higher than expected defaults or bankruptcies  the company s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due the company could be materially reduced 
the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns was million and million as of february  and february   respectively 
inventory valuation as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the retail last in  first out lifo method 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and resulting gross margin is derived by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry 
use of the retail inventory method will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are taken timely as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the retail inventory method calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  merchandise markups  markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly impact both the ending inventory valuation at cost and resulting gross margin 
these significant estimates  coupled with the fact that the retail inventory method is an averaging process  can  under certain circumstances  result in individual inventory components with cost above related net realizable value 
factors that can lead to this result include applying the retail inventory method to a group of products that is not fairly uniform in terms of its cost  selling price relationship and turnover  or applying the retail inventory method to transactions over a period of time that includes different rates of gross profit  such as those relating to seasonal merchandise 
in addition  failure to take timely markdowns can result in an overstatement of cost under the lower of cost or market principle 
management believes that the company s retail inventory method provides an inventory valuation that approximates cost and results in carrying inventory in the aggregate at the lower of cost or market 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess or old inventory based primarily on an estimated forecast of merchandise demand for the selling season 
demand for merchandise can fluctuate greatly  a significant increase in the demand for merchandise could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  estimates of future merchandise demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the company may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess or old inventory 
if the company s inventory is determined to be overvalued in the future  the company would be required to recognize such costs in the costs of goods sold and reduce operating income at the time of such determination 
likewise  if inventory is later determined to be undervalued  the company may have overstated the costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional operating income at the time of such determination 
therefore  although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future merchandise demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or the economy in the company s markets could have a significant impact on the value of the company s inventory and reported operating results 
as is currently the case with many companies in the retail industry  the company s lifo calculations have yielded inventory increases in recent years due to deflation reflected in price indices used 
this is the result of the lifo method whereby merchandise sold is valued at the cost of more recent inventory purchases which the deflationary indices indicate to be lower  resulting in the general inventory on hand being carried at the older  higher costs 
given these higher values and the promotional retail environment  the company reduced the carrying value of its lifo inventories by million and million as of february  and february   respectively  to a net realizable value nrv 
inherent in these nrv assessments and related reserves are significant management judgments and estimates regarding future merchandise selling costs and pricing 
should these estimates prove to be inaccurate  the company may have overstated or understated its inventory carrying value 
in such cases  the company would be required to recognize cost increases or decreases in costs of goods sold  and impact operating income accordingly  at the time of such determination 
vendor allowances as is standard industry practice  the company receives allowances from merchandise vendors as reimbursement for charges incurred on marked down merchandise 
vendor allowances are generally credited to costs of goods sold  provided the allowance is collectable  for merchandise either permanently marked down or sold  not predicated on a future purchase  not predicated on a future increase in the purchase price from the vendor  and authorized by internal management 
if the aforementioned criteria are not met  the company reflects the allowances as an adjustment to the cost of merchandise capitalized in inventory 
additionally  the company receives allowances from vendors in connection with cooperative advertising programs 
these amounts are recognized by the company as a reduction of the related advertising costs that have been incurred and reflected in selling  general and administrative expenses 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the process involves the company summarizing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items eg  inventory valuation reserves for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
the company must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or tax carry back availability and  to the extent the company believes recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance in a period  an expense must be recorded within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
net deferred tax assets were million and million as of february  and february   respectively 
no valuation allowance has been established against net deferred tax assets  as the company believes these tax benefits will be realizable through reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities  tax carry back availability and future taxable income 
if actual results differ from these estimates or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  the company may need to establish a valuation allowance  which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 
legislation changes currently proposed by certain states in which the company operates could have a materially adverse impact on future operating results of the company 
these legislation changes principally involve state income tax laws 
long lived assets property  fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in the company s business model or capital strategy can result in the actual useful lives differing from the company s estimates 
in cases where the company determines that the useful life of property  fixtures and equipment should be shortened  the company depreciates the net book value in excess of the salvage value over its revised remaining useful life  thereby increasing depreciation expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of fixtures or leasehold improvements could also result in shortened useful lives 
net property  fixtures and equipment amounted to million and million as of february  and february   respectively 
the company assesses  on a store by store basis  the impairment of identifiable long lived assets primarily property  fixtures and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance of stores relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of assets or overall business strategy  and significant negative industry or economic trends for a sustained period 
the company records impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect the company s best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
estimates of fair value represent the company s best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
should cash flow estimates differ significantly from actual results  an impairment could arise and materially impact the company s financial position and results of operations 
newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results 
factors such as store type  store location  current marketplace awareness of the company s private label brands  local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results 
if economic conditions prove to be substantially different from the company s expectations  the carrying value of new stores may ultimately become impaired 
in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 which supersedes sfas no 
sfas no 
 effective for fiscal  retains provisions of sfas no 
regarding recognition and measurement of long lived asset impairment 
sfas no 
supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions for segments of a business to be disposed of 
in fiscal  the company evaluated the recoverability of its long lived assets 
as a result of the evaluation  an impairment loss of approximately million was recorded in depreciation and amortization expense 
additionally  the company has identified assets in the new york market with a net book value of approximately million that have under performed relative to the company average 
the company has taken steps to address these issues and currently forecasts no impairment charge 
should the company s improvement efforts prove unsuccessful or economic conditions change  the carrying value of these assets may ultimately become impaired 
goodwill and intangible assets net goodwill was million as of february  and february  intangible assets are comprised of lease interests that relate to below market rate leases purchased in store acquisitions completed in fiscal years through  which were adjusted to reflect fair market value 
these leases had average lives of twenty five years 
net intangible assets amounted to million and million as of february  and february   respectively 
as a result of the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 the company now annually reviews goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives for impairment and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values 
the company determines fair value using discounted cash flow analysis  which requires certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and future profitability of acquired businesses 
it is the company s policy to conduct impairment testing based on its most current business plans  which reflect anticipated changes in the economy and the industry 
if actual results prove inconsistent with company assumptions and judgments  the company could be exposed to a material impairment charge 
securitizations a significant portion of the company s funding is through off balance sheet credit card securitizations via sales of certain accounts receivable through an accounts receivable facility the facility 
the sale of receivables is to the bon ton receivables partnership  lp btrlp  a special purpose entity  as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
btrlp is a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
btrlp may sell accounts receivable with a purchase price up to million through the facility to a conduit on a revolving basis 
the company sells accounts receivable through securitizations with servicing retained 
when the company securitizes  it surrenders control over the transferred assets and accounts for the transaction as a sale to the extent that consideration other than beneficial interests in the transferred assets is received in exchange 
the company allocates the previous carrying amount of the securitized receivables between the assets sold and retained interests  based on their relative estimated fair values at the date of sale 
securitization income is recognized at the time of the sale  and is equal to the excess of the fair value of the assets obtained principally cash over the allocated cost of the assets sold and transaction costs 
during the revolving period of each accounts receivable securitization  securitization income is recorded representing estimated gains on the sale of new receivables to the conduit on a continuous basis to replenish the investors interest in securitized receivables that have been repaid by the credit card account holders 
fair value estimates used in the recognition of securitization income require certain assumptions of payment  default  servicing costs and interest rates 
to the extent actual results differ from those estimates  the impact is recognized as securitization income 
the company estimates the fair value of retained interests in securitizations based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
the cash flows of the retained interest only strip are estimated as the excess of the weighted average finance charge yield on each pool of receivables sold over the sum of the interest rate paid to the note holder  the servicing fee and an estimate of future credit losses over the life of the receivables 
cash flows are discounted from the date the cash is expected to become available to the company 
these cash flows are projected over the life of the receivables using payment  default  and interest rate assumptions that the company believes would be used by market participants for similar financial instruments subject to prepayment  credit and interest rate risk 
the cash flows are discounted using an interest rate that the company believes a purchaser unrelated to the seller of the financial instrument would demand 
as all estimates used are influenced by factors outside the company s control  there is uncertainty inherent in these estimates  making it reasonably possible that they could change in the near term 
any adverse change in the company s assumptions could materially impact securitization income 
the company recognized securitization income of million  million and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the increased income in fiscal relative to fiscal was principally a reflection of increased sales on the company s proprietary credit card and lower securitization facility costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk and financial instruments the company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates 
to provide some protection against potential rate increases associated with its variable rate facilities  the company has entered into various derivative financial transactions in the form of interest rate swaps 
the interest rate swaps are used to hedge the underlying variable rate facilities 
the swaps are qualifying hedges and the interest rate differential is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swaps 
the company currently holds variable to fixed rate swaps with a notional amount of million with several financial institutions for various terms 
the notional amount does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties  but it is used as the basis to calculate amounts due and to be received under the rate swaps 
the company believes the derivative financial instruments entered into provide protection from volatile upward swings in interest rates associated with the company s variable rate facilities 
during fiscal and  the company did not enter into or hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the following table provides information about the company s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including debt obligations and interest rate swaps 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates as of february  for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average pay and receive interest rates by expected maturity date 
for additional discussion of the company s interest rate swaps  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
expected maturity date by fiscal year dollars in there thousands after total fair value debt fixed rate debt     average fixed rate variable rate debt     average variable rate interest rate derivatives interest rate swaps variable to fixed      average pay rate average receive rate seasonality and inflation the company s business  like that of most retailers  is subject to seasonal fluctuations  with the major portion of sales and income realized during the second half of each fiscal year  which includes the back to school and holiday seasons 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the company s quarterly results for fiscal and due to the fixed nature of certain costs  selling  general and administrative expenses are typically higher as a percentage of net sales during the first half of each fiscal year 
because of the seasonality of the company s business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
in addition  quarterly operating results are impacted by the timing and amount of revenues and costs associated with the opening of new stores and closing and remodeling of existing stores 
the company does not believe inflation had a material effect on operating results during the past three years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflationary adjustments in the future
