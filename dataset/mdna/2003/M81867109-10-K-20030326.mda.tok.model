item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
see special note regarding forward looking statements 
overview we develop  market and support software that enables companies to assure the scalability  efficiency and reliability of web applications 
in  we introduced our first web testing product  webload  which was initially focused on assessing the scalability of web applications 
since then  we have enhanced the functionality of webload to provide an integrated solution to assess the performance and accelerate the deployment of web applications 
in february  we introduced webrm  which is designed to facilitate the systematic verification of web application quality throughout the application development lifecycle and to accelerate the deployment of high performance web applications 
in august  we introduced webft  a testing tool for verification of the functionality of web applications 
our revenues were million in  million in and million in our revenues are primarily derived from the license of our webload and webrm software products  and to a lesser extent  from our webft software product 
we also derive revenues from related services including customer support  maintenance and training 
we license our software primarily through a direct sales force and  to a lesser extent  through indirect channels 
to date  we have licensed our software to customers in north america  europe  asia pacific  and the middle east 
revenues derived from north america as a percent of total revenues were in  in and in while we expect to continue to derive the majority of our revenues from north america  we intend to derive an increasing percentage of our revenues from europe and asia pacific 
substantially all of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
our net loss was million in  million in and million in these net losses resulted primarily from the expansion of our operations through and the significant costs incurred in the development of our software 
in january  we restructured our business through the termination of of the then current workforce 
as a result of the restructuring  we recorded a restructuring charge of  in the first quarter of consisting of employee severance costs  idle lease facilities costs and fixed asset impairment costs 
during the second quarter of  we recorded additional restructuring costs of  consisting of employee severance cost 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded additional restructuring costs of  consisting of idle lease space costs 
we had previously taken cost reduction actions in july and october  including the termination of an aggregate of approximately of our workforce and the termination of certain sales facilities leases 
significant accounting policies general we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results  we believe it is important to understand our policies for revenue recognition  software development costs and stock options 
revenue recognition we recognize software license revenues upon delivery of our software to customers  provided persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
we allocate our software license revenues under arrangements where we sell software and services together under one contract to each element based on our relative fair values  with these fair values being determined using the price charged when that element is sold separately 
if fair value for a delivered element does not exist but the fair value does exist for all undelivered elements  we defer the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the remaining value for the delivered elements 
we generally recognize software license revenues from resellers or distributors at the time of shipment  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria set forth in governing statements of position on software revenue recognition have been met 
we recognize services revenues from software maintenance agreements ratably over the term of the maintenance period  typically one year 
we recognize services revenues from training as the services are performed 
amounts collected or billed prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are reflected as deferred revenue 
software development costs we account for software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
software development costs incurred from the point of reaching technological feasibility until the time of general product release should be capitalized 
we define technological feasibility as the completion of a working model 
because we sell our products in a market that is subject to rapid technological change  new product development and changing customer needs  we have concluded that technological feasibility is not established until the development stage of the product is nearly complete 
for us  the period in which we can capitalize software development costs is very short  so the amounts that could be capitalized are not material to our financial statements 
therefore  we have charged all such costs to research and development expense in the period incurred 
stock options we account for stock options issued to employees under the intrinsic method in accordance with accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under this approach we do not record any expense unless the exercise price is greater than the fair market price of our ordinary shares on the date of grant 
we have provided disclosures of impact to our reported net loss and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to stock based employee compensation 
results of operations the following table sets forth the consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated for the year ended december  revenues software licenses service total revenues cost of revenues software licenses nonrecurring royalty reversal service total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative stock based compensation nonrecurring charges total operating expenses loss from operations other income interest income  net other income  net net loss years ended december  and revenues total revenues 
total revenues decreased million  or  from million in to million in total revenues decreased due to a million decrease in total revenues from customers in the us and a  decrease in total revenues from international customers 
total revenues from us customers decreased from million in to million in due to lower unit volume sales of software licenses experienced primarily in the second half of and continuing throughout and a reduction in related service revenues 
total revenues from international customers decreased from million in to million in due to lower unit volume sales of software licenses  offset  in part  by an increase in service revenues 
software licenses 
software license revenues decreased million  or  from million in to million in total software license revenues from us customers decreased from million in to million in due to lower unit volume sales arising primarily in the second half of and continuing throughout attributable to weakness in the us economy and slower technology spending 
total revenues from international customers decreased from million in to million in due to lower unit volume sales due to slower technology spending throughout europe 
services 
services revenues consist primarily of revenue from annual support and maintenance contracts  and to a lesser extent  training and consulting services 
service revenues decreased  or  from million in to million in the decrease was due to a decline of  of service revenues in the us  offset  in part  by an increase of  in services revenues from international customers 
service revenues from us customers decreased from million in to million in due to a slow down in product revenues  from which services revenues are derived 
service revenues from international customers increased from  in to  in due to a larger installed customer base internationally 
cost of revenues cost of software licenses 
cost of software licenses consists principally of direct product costs  such as product media and packaging  as well as royalties due to third parties 
cost of software licenses was  in  or of software license revenue  compared to  in  or of software license revenue 
the decrease was due to the absence in of royalty costs to the government of israel  through the office of chief scientist  as we had fully provided for our maximum liability for these royalties in nonrecurring royalty reversal 
the nonrecurring royalty reversal relates to a change in estimate of our royalty obligations to the government of israel  through the office of chief scientist 
through  we received grants totaling  from the office of the chief scientist that were used to fund a predecessor product 
we were obligated to pay royalties based on revenues derived from sales of products funded with these grants  up to of certain grant amounts received 
in october  the office of chief scientist completed its examination of our technology and our use of grant funds and concluded that our remaining royalty obligation was  as a result  we reversed  of accrued royalties  which has been reflected as a reduction in cost of product sales during the fourth quarter of cost of services 
cost of services consists principally of personnel related costs associated with customer support and training 
cost of services was million in  or of service revenues  compared to  in  or of service revenue 
this decrease was due to reduced personnel costs to provide support and maintenance services resulting from the headcount reductions taken in the second half of and the first half of operating expenses sales and marketing

sales and marketing expenses were million in  or of total revenues  compared to million in  or of total revenues

research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and related expenses required to develop and enhance our products 
research and development expenses were million in  or of total revenues  compared to million in  or of total revenues

general and administrative expenses consist principally of executive  finance and administrative salaries and related expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in  or of total revenues  compared to million in  or of total revenues 
the decrease in absolute dollars was due to a reduction of headcount in general and administrative personnel 
we expect that general and administrative expenses in will remain relatively constant compared to stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense reflects the accounting charge relating to the issuance of equity instruments to employees at an exercise price below fair market value and to all equity instruments issued to nonemployees 
for stock options granted to employees  the difference between the exercise price and the estimated fair value of the ordinary shares on the date options are granted is charged to operations as stock based compensation expense over the vesting period of the underlying options 
for stock options granted to nonemployees  the value of a particular grant as determined by the black scholes valuation model is charged to operations as stock based compensation expense over the service period or vesting period of the underlying option 
stock based compensation expense was  in compared to  in the decrease resulted from the cancellation of employee stock options for terminated employees for whom stock based compensation was originally recorded 
deferred compensation on the unvested options is included as a component of shareholders equity and amortized to stock based compensation expense over the vesting period of the underlying options 
deferred stock based compensation totaled  at december   and will result in additional charges to operations through may nonrecurring expenses 
nonrecurring expenses consist of restructuring charges and other nonrecurring costs 
nonrecurring expenses were million in and  in nonrecurring expenses in consisted of restructuring charges of million and a payment of  for the termination of a facility lease agreement in march the restructuring charges recorded in totaled million and were incurred in july and october  when we implemented two separate restructuring plans to lower operating costs

income taxes 
we have estimated net operating loss carryforwards for israeli tax purposes totaling approximately million through december  that would reduce future israeli income taxes  if any 
these net operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely and offset against future taxable income 
there will be no tax benefit available from these losses and no deferred income taxes have been included in our financial statements 
our us subsidiary has net operating loss carryforwards for us federal and state tax purposes totaling approximately million through december  these losses are available to offset any future us taxable income of the us subsidiary and will expire between and we have recorded a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset due to the uncertainty surrounding the ability and the timing of the realization of these tax benefits

through december   we repurchased  of our ordinary shares at an aggregate cost of  we lease all of our office facilities under noncancellable operating leases that expire over varying terms through as of december   the future total lease payments under these leases are as follows  in   in  and  in we expect that operating expenses  as well as planned capital expenditures  will constitute a material use of our cash resources 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
we may find it necessary to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
in the event additional financing is required  we may not be able to complete financing on acceptable terms or at all 
impact of inflation and currency fluctuations a large portion of our revenues is received  and a large portion of our expenses is incurred  in us dollars 
revenues denominated in us dollars as a percent of total revenues were in  in and in expenses denominated in us dollars as a percent of total expenses were in  in  and in a portion of our expenses  mainly salary and personnel costs related to our employees in israel  is incurred in new israeli shekels  or nis 
the salaries of our israel based employees are partially linked to increases in the israeli consumer price index 
as a result  the us dollar cost of our israeli operations is influenced by inflation in israel as well as the currency exchange rate between the nis in relation to the us dollar 
any increase in the rate of inflation in israel may have a negative effect on our operating results  unless such inflation is offset by a devaluation of the nis in relation to the us dollar 
exchange rates between the nis and the dollar fluctuate continuously  and therefore exchange rate fluctuations and especially larger periodic devaluations will have an impact on our operating results and period to period comparisons of its results 
the effects of foreign currency translations are reported in our financial statements in current operating results 
we believe that neither inflation in israel  nor exchange rate fluctuations between the nis and the us dollar  historically has had a material effect on our operations 
in addition to our operations in israel  we also conduct operations in germany and the united kingdom 
transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar or nis were not material 
government grants the government of israel  through the office of the chief scientist  encourages research and development projects that result in products for export 
through  we received grants totaling  from the office of the chief scientist that were used primarily to fund a predecessor product 
we were obligated to pay royalties based on revenues derived from sales of products funded with these grants  up to of certain grant amounts received 
in october  the office of chief scientist completed its examination of our technology and use of grant funding and concluded that our remaining royalty obligation was  as a result  we have reversed  of accrued royalties that has been recorded as a reduction in cost of product sales during the fourth quarter of effective corporate tax rate israeli companies are generally subject to tax at the rate of of taxable income 
however  we have derived  and expect to continue to derive  a substantial portion of our income under our approved enterprise capital investment program 
subject to compliance with applicable requirements  this income will be tax exempt for a period of two years and will be subject to a reduced corporate tax rate of in the following five years 
if we do not comply with the applicable requirements  the tax benefits may be canceled 
we believe that we comply with these conditions 
if we operate under more than one approval  or if our capital investments are only partially approved  our effective tax rate will be a weighted combination of the various applicable tax rates 
we may not be able to obtain approval for additional approved enterprise programs 
since we have incurred tax losses through december   we have not yet used the tax benefits for which we are eligible 
market risk we currently do not invest in  or hold for trading or other purposes  any financial instruments subject to market risk 
we currently do not have any outstanding borrowings or other credit facilities 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  was issued 
sfas no 
addresses the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities 
sfas no 
requires that costs associated with exit or disposal activities be recognized when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
is effective for all exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position

discussions containing forward looking statements may be found in the material set forth under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as well as in this report generally 
we generally use words such as believe  may  could  will  intend  estimate  expect  anticipate  plan  and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are subject to various risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated in such statements 
these risks  uncertainties and factors include  but are not limited to our limited operating history and history of losses  significant competition  and other factors detailed in our filings with the securities and exchange commission  including this annual report on form k 
although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  they related only to events as of the date on which the statements are made  and we cannot assure you that its future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements will meet these expectation 
moreover  neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward looking statements 
we do not intend to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of this report to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations  except as required by law 
passive foreign investment company status general we will be a passive foreign investment company  or pfic  for us federal income tax purposes in any tax year if  in such tax year  either or more of our gross income is passive in nature  also referred to as the income test  or  on average for such tax year  or more of our assets  at fair value  produce or are held for the production of passive income  also referred to as the asset test 
we must make a separate determination each year as to whether we are a pfic 
as a result  our pfic status may change 
classification of a company as a pfic has important and adverse tax implications to any us holder of a foreign corporation s stock  or a us holder 
for purposes of this summary  a us holder is a holder that is  for us income tax purposes a citizen or resident of the united states  a domestic us corporation  an estate  the income of which is subject to us federal income tax regardless of the source of its income  and any trust if either i a us court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more us persons have the authority to control all the substantial decisions of the trust  or ii the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable us treasury regulations to be treated as a united states person 
in applying the asset test  a foreign corporation will be classified as a pfic if the average percentage of its assets during the tax year which produce  or are held for the production of  passive income  or passive assets  is or more of its total assets 
our cash and cash equivalents are considered to be passive assets 
the value of the total assets of a publicly traded foreign corporation is generally equal to the sum of the aggregate value of its outstanding stock plus its liabilities 
the asset test for a tax year generally is applied by averaging the results determined as of the end of each quarter of the tax year 
our determination of pfic status we believe we were a pfic for the taxable years ended and due primarily to the decline in the market price of our ordinary shares relative to the value of our passive assets 
if we were indeed a pfic for these periods  a us holder who owned our shares in or will be subject to reporting requirements for that year and succeeding years  even if in subsequent years we are no longer a pfic 
us holders may also be subject to increased us tax liabilities 
if we cease to be a pfic  a us holder may avoid pfic classification for subsequent years upon making shareholder elections in certain circumstances  as described in greater detail below 
we expect that we will be a pfic in if our expectation is accurate  the same reporting obligations and tax consequences described below will apply to us holders who acquire shares during the taxable year 
tax consequences if we are a pfic there are no us federal income tax consequences to a us holder if we are classified as a pfic 
if we are a pfic for us federal income tax purposes for any year during a us holder s holding period of our ordinary shares and such us holder does not make either of the special elections described later  any gain recognized by a us holder upon the sale of ordinary shares  or upon the receipt of certain distributions  would be treated as ordinary income 
such income generally would be allocated ratably over a us holder s holding period with respect to our ordinary shares 
the amount allocated to prior years  with certain exceptions  will be subject to tax at the highest tax rate in effect for those years and an interest charge would be imposed on the amount of deferred tax on the income allocated to the prior taxable years 
although we generally will be treated as a pfic as to any us holder if we are a pfic for any year during a us holder s holding period  if we cease to satisfy the requirements for pfic classification  the us holder may avoid pfic classification for subsequent years if the us holder elects to recognize gain based on the unrealized appreciation in the ordinary shares through the close of the tax year in which we cease to be a pfic 
additionally  if we are a pfic  a us holder who acquires ordinary shares from a decedent would be denied the normally available step up in tax basis for our ordinary shares to fair market value at the date of death and instead would have a tax basis equal to the decedent s tax basis 
for any tax year in which we are determined to be a pfic  us holders may elect to treat their ordinary shares as an interest in a qualified electing fund  or a qef election  in which case the us holders would be required to include in income currently their proportionate share of our earnings and profits in years in which we are a pfic regardless of whether distributions of such earnings and profits are actually distributed to such us holders 
any gain subsequently recognized upon the sale of their ordinary shares by such us holders generally would be taxed as capital gain and a denial of the basis step up at death would not apply 
a shareholder may make a qef election with respect to a pfic for any taxable year of the shareholder 
a qef election is effective for the year in which the election is made and all subsequent taxable years of the shareholder 
procedures exist for both retroactive elections and the filing of protective statements 
a us holder making the qef election must make the election on or before the due date  as extended  for the filing of the shareholder s income tax return for the first taxable year to which the election will apply 
a us holder must make a qef election by completing form  return by a shareholder of a passive foreign investment company or qualified electing fund  and attaching it to their us federal income tax return  and must satisfy additional filing requirements each year the election remains in effect 
we intend to provide to each shareholder  upon request  the tax information required to make a qef election and to make subsequent annual filings 
as an alternative to a qef election  a us holder generally may be able to avoid the imposition of the special tax and interest charge described above by electing to mark to market the ordinary shares  or a mark to market election  recognizing as ordinary income or loss for each taxable year  subject to certain limitations  the difference between the fair market value of the us holder s ordinary shares and the adjusted tax basis of such ordinary shares 
losses would be allowed only to the extent of the net mark to market gain accrued under the election 
if a mark to market election with respect to ordinary shares is in effect on the date of a us holder s death  the normally available step up in tax basis to fair market value will not be available 
rather  the tax basis of such ordinary shares in the hands of a us holder who acquired them from a decedent will be the lesser of the decedent s tax basis or the fair market value of the ordinary shares 
us holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the eligibility  manner and advisability of making a qef election or a mark to market election  and the effect of these elections on the calculation of the amount of foreign tax credit that may be available to a us holder 
a us holder who beneficially owns shares of a pfic must file form with the us internal revenue service for each tax year in which the us holder holds stock in a pfic 
this form describes any distributions received with respect to these shares and any gain realized upon the disposition of these shares 
the summary above is based on current provisions of the united states internal revenue code of  as amended  the final  temporary and proposed us treasury regulations promulgated thereunder  and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof  all of which are subject to change  possibly with retroactive effect 
this summary is limited to a description of certain of the material us federal income tax consequences to us holders of our status as a pfic and does not consider any other aspects of us federal income taxation that may be relevant to us holders  nor does it consider all aspects of the pfic regime that may be relevant to particular us holders by reason of their particular circumstances 
this summary is directed only to us holders that hold ordinary shares as capital assets and does not address the considerations that may be applicable to particular classes of us holders  including tax exempt organizations  holders of ordinary shares as part of a straddle  hedge or conversion transaction  us holders who own  directly  indirectly or through attribution  or more of our outstanding ordinary shares  and persons who own ordinary shares through a partnership or other pass through entity 
rules relating to a pfic are very complex 
us holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of pfic rules to their investments in our ordinary shares 
risk factors certain factors that may affect future results a number of uncertainties exist that could affect our operating results  including  without limitation  the following risks related to our operations we have had losses since our inception and expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
we incurred net losses of million in  million in and million in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
moreover  we expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses 
we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and cannot be certain if or when we will achieve profitability 
even if we do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate  and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or our investors  our share price may decrease significantly and you could lose part or all of your investment 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to continue to vary significantly in the future 
our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
the factors that may cause fluctuations of our operating results include the following the size  timing and terms of sales of our products and services  unexpected delays we may encounter in introducing new versions of our existing products as well as any new future products and services  our ability to successfully retain our direct sales force and international sales organization  our ability to establish and maintain relationships with our partners  and the fixed nature of expenses such as base compensation and rent 
due to these and other factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of our future performance 
it is possible that in future periods our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this occurs  the price of our ordinary shares may decline 
the slow down in technology spending has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the deterioration of economies around the world and economic uncertainty that began in continued throughout and is still continuing 
this has resulted in a curtailment of technology spending by many businesses across many industries 
it has also reduced our ability to forecast orders  also referred to as low visibility 
we believe that this slow down in technology spending will continue and are uncertain as to when this slow down will end 
as a result of this slow down  our revenues decreased from million in to million in to million in the decline in technology spending has reduced our revenues  and may result in pressure on the price of our products and prolong the time until we are paid  all of which would have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations 
the terrorist attacks in the united states are impacting the global economy and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the terrorist attacks in the united states on september   followed by military action by the united states and the threat of continuing military action  are impacting the global economy 
the future course of this conflict and its effect on the global economy and technology spending cannot be predicted 
terrorist attacks can have both direct and indirect impact on our business as a result of  among other things  attacks on our suppliers  employees  customers or research facilities  military service obligations of our key employees and changes in monetary and fiscal policies  all of which may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations 
we expect to depend on sales of our webload and webrm products for substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that revenues from our webload and webrm products will constitute substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
consequently  any decline in the demand for our webload and webrm products or their failure to achieve broad market acceptance  would seriously harm our business 
if we fail to develop new products and enhance our existing products to respond to emerging technologies and industry trends  we may lose market share to our competitors and revenues may decline 
the target market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements  evolving industry standards and significant competition 
we expect to introduce new products and develop enhancements to our existing products 
our future financial performance depends upon our ability to timely identify new market trends and internet technology and to develop and commercialize software that is compatible with these emerging trends and technologies 
we may not accurately identify trends and technologies or we may experience difficulties that delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of new or enhanced software products in the future 
in addition  our products may not meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance 
if we fail to successfully and timely develop and deploy new products or product enhancements  we may lose market share to our competitors and our revenues may decline 
in addition  our existing software products could become obsolete and unmarketable with the introduction of products  web applications or computer systems employing new technologies or industry standards 
if our current software products become obsolete and we fail to introduce new products  our business will not be viable 
further  if our competitors introduce products earlier or that are more responsive than our products to emerging technologies and market trends  we will lose market share to our competitors and our revenues may decline 
we face significant competition from other technology companies and we may not be able to compete effectively 
the web application performance and testing solutions market is intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of market participants 
our primary competitors include companies who mainly offer application testing software  such as mercury interactive 
in addition  we compete against companies that provide a broader spectrum of development tools that include some verification functionality  such as rational software 
we expect that competition will intensify in the future and that additional competitors will enter the market with competing products as the size and visibility of the market opportunity increases 
increased competition is likely to result in pricing pressures  reduced margins and may result in the failure of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
some of our competitors have longer operating histories  better brand recognition  a larger installed base of customers and substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards or customer requirements 
many of our competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products directly to customers through bundling or other means 
if competitors were to bundle competing products with their products  the demand for our products might be substantially reduced and our ability to distribute our products successfully would be substantially diminished 
the entry of new competitors into our market could reduce our sales  require us to lower our prices  or both 
many of the factors that affect competition are outside our control  and there can be no assurance that we can maintain or enhance our competitive position against current and future competitors 
our sales cycle depends partly on factors outside our control and may cause our revenues to vary significantly 
our customers view the purchase of our products as an important decision 
as a result  our customers may take a long time to evaluate our products before making their purchase decisions and this could result in a long  and often unpredictable  sales and implementation cycle for our products 
this may cause our revenues and results of operations to vary significantly from period to period 
in addition  we may expend significant sales and marketing expenses during the evaluation period before the customer places an order with us 
our customers often begin by purchasing our products on a pilot basis before they decide whether or not to purchase additional licenses for broader use within their organizations 
we usually have no significant order backlog 
this makes revenues in any quarter substantially dependent upon orders we receive and deliver in that quarter 
because of this  our revenues and results of operations in any quarter may not meet market expectations or be indicative of future performance and it may be difficult for you to evaluate our prospects 
defects in our products may increase our costs and diminish the demand for our products 
our products are complex and they have occasionally contained  and may in the future contain  undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions are released 
if our products do not perform as intended in specific company environments  we may incur warranty and repair costs  be subject to liability and experience delays 
regardless of the source of the errors  we must divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our research and development efforts to address any errors 
we may incur warranty or repair costs  be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors or experience delays as a result of these errors in the future 
any insurance policies that we may have may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted 
moreover  the occurrence of errors  whether caused by our products or the products of another vendor  may result in significant customer relation problems and injury to our reputation and may impair the market acceptance of our products and technology 
failure to develop strategic relationships could limit our growth 
we believe that our success in penetrating our target markets depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain strategic relationships with resellers  systems integrators and distribution partners 
if we are unable to maintain our existing marketing and distribution relationships  or fail to enter into additional relationships  we will have to devote substantially more resources to direct sales and marketing of our products 
in addition  licenses of our products through indirect channels have been limited to date 
our existing relationships do not  and any future relationships may not  afford us exclusive marketing or distribution rights 
therefore  our partners could reduce their commitment to us at any time in the future 
in addition  many of these partners have multiple relationships and they may not regard us as significant for their business 
in addition  these partners may terminate their relationships with us  pursue other relationships with our competitors or develop or acquire products that compete with our products 
even if we succeed in entering into these relationships  they may not result in additional customers or revenues 
future acquisitions may be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute shareholder value or divert management attention 
as part of our business strategy  we may seek to acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies that we believe would complement or expand our business  augment our market coverage  enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities 
acquisitions could create risks for us  including difficulties in assimilation of acquired personnel  operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs associated with acquisitions  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  adverse effects on our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  and use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisitions 
in addition  if we consummate acquisitions through an exchange of our securities  shareholders could suffer significant dilution 
any future acquisitions  even if successfully completed  may not generate any additional revenue or provide any benefit to our business 
if we fail to manage our geographically dispersed organization  we may fail to implement our business plan and our revenues may decline 
we have our principal executive offices in the us and conduct our research and development primarily in israel 
in addition  we have sales offices in the us  israel  germany and the united kingdom 
our directors  executive officers and other key employees are similarly dispersed throughout the world 
our management must devote resources to manage geographically diverse operations 
in addition  conducting international operations subjects us to risks we do not face in the united states 
these include currency exchange rate fluctuations  seasonal fluctuations in purchasing patterns  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  difficulties in managing and staffing international operations  potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 
failure to manage our geographically dispersed organization could harm our business 
the success of our business depends on our senior management  including ilan kinreich  our chief executive officer and president  whose knowledge of our business and expertise would be difficult to replace 
our success depends largely on the continued contributions of our senior management 
in particular  we depend on the services of ilan kinreich  our chief executive officer and president 
employment agreements with our senior management team and other key personnel  including mr 
kinreich  do not require a specified service obligation 
we also do not carry life insurance on our senior management or other key personnel 
if one or more members of our senior management were to terminate their employment  we could experience delays in product development  loss of sales and diversion of management resources 
we may not be able to retain our existing personnel  which could negatively impact development  sales and support of our products 
in july  october and january  we reduced the number of our employees in order to reduce our operating expenses 
as a result  our success depends on our ability to retain our existing experienced employees 
if we fail to retain our current employees  our revenues could decline 
competition for qualified personnel is intense  and we may not be able to retain our highly qualified personnel 
our future success also depends upon the continued service of our key sales  marketing and support personnel 
in addition  our products and technologies are complex and we are substantially dependent upon the continued service of our existing engineering personnel 
none of our key employees are bound by an employment agreement that requires a specified service obligation 
if we are not able to retain our existing personnel  we could have difficulty developing  selling or supporting our products 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights and we may lose a valuable asset or incur costly and time consuming litigation attempting to protect our rights 
our success depends upon the protection of our technology  trade secrets and trademarks 
to protect our rights to our intellectual property  we rely on a combination of trade secret protection  patent law  trademark law  confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements 
the protective steps we have taken may be inadequate to deter infringement or misappropriation 
we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of our intellectual property or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
policing unauthorized use of our products and technology is difficult 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries in which we currently or may in the future sell our products do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
failure to adequately protect against or to promptly detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property could devalue our proprietary content and impair our ability to compete effectively 
defending our intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources  whether or not the defense is successful 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop similar technology  or duplicate our products or our other intellectual property 
we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or know how or to determine the scope  validity or enforceability of our intellectual property rights 
our protective measures may prove inadequate to protect our proprietary rights  and any failure to enforce or protect our rights could cause us to lose a valuable asset 
we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims that  with or without merit  could be costly to defend or settle 
substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry 
we expect that software products may be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segments grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
third parties may make a claim of infringement against us with respect to our products and technology or claims that our intellectual property rights are invalid 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  or delay product delivery 
in addition  if our products were found to infringe a third party s proprietary rights  we could be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to continue to be able to sell our products 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
a successful claim of product infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology could harm our business 
we do not have sufficient insurance to cover all of our potential product liability and warranty claims 
companies use our products to assure the performance of their web applications 
in many cases  web applications serve critical business functions 
the sale and support of our products may entail the risk of product liability or warranty claims based on our products not detecting critical errors or problems with web applications that fail in a live environment and cause companies financial loss 
in addition  the failure of our products to perform to customer expectations could give rise to warranty claims 
although we seek to limit our exposure to claims under our license terms and we carry general liability insurance  it is unlikely that our insurance would cover potential claims of this type and our insurance may not be adequate to protect us from all liability that may be imposed 
if we are subject to any claims  our results of operations may be harmed 
we may need additional capital to finance our operations and may not be able to raise additional financing 
we may need to raise additional capital to finance our operations if we are unable to generate cash flow from operations 
through december   we have been using cash in operating our business 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
this could inhibit our ability to run our business 
the market price of our ordinary shares has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly 
our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly 
the price of our ordinary shares has decreased significantly since august fluctuations in our share price can occur for reasons that may be unrelated to operating results  including stock market wide downturns and events in the technology industry as well as in israel 
these fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares 
there may be an adverse effect on the market price of our shares as a result of shares being available for sale in the future 
if our shareholders sell substantial amounts of our ordinary shares  including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options  the market price of our ordinary shares may decline 
these sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and place that we deem appropriate 
our principal shareholders  executive officers and directors have substantial control over most matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders  thereby limiting the power of other shareholders to influence corporate action 
as of february   our officers  directors and principal shareholders beneficially owned of our outstanding ordinary shares 
as a result  these shareholders may have the power to control the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of shareholders  including the election of members of our board and the approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of making it more difficult to obtain approval for a change in control of us 
risks relating to our industry and the internet our future revenues and profits  if any  depend upon the use of the internet as an effective medium of business and communication our success will depend  in large part  on the acceptance of the internet to conduct business and on the ability of third parties to provide a reliable internet infrastructure network with the speed  data capacity and security necessary for reliable internet access and services 
to the extent that the internet continues to experience increased numbers of users  increased frequency of use or increased bandwidth requirements of users  the internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it and the performance or reliability of the internet could suffer  resulting in decreased users and resulting harm to our business 
our performance depends on the demand for high technology products and services 
our success depends heavily on the demand for products and services related to the high technology sector of the economy 
growth within this sector has slowed or even declined over the past months 
if demand for high technology products and services does not grow or even experiences negative growth  demand for our products and services will be reduced and our revenues will be negatively impacted risks relating to our location in israel conditions in israel affect our operations and may limit our ability to produce and sell our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are incorporated under israeli law and our primary research and development facilities are located in israel 
political  economic and military conditions in israel directly affect our operations 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a state of hostility  varying in degree and intensity  has led to security and economic problems for israel 
several countries still restrict business with israeli companies as a result of the israeli arab conflict 
in particular  the hostilities between the state of israel and the palestinians have increased in the past two years 
the future of peace efforts between israel and its arab neighbors is uncertain 
in addition  military confrontations in the region  including iraq  may ultimately involve the state of israel 
any major hostilities involving israel could lead to attacks on our suppliers  employees  customers or research facilities  military service obligations of our key employees  interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its trading partners  a significant increase in inflation  or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if our key personnel are required to perform military service  we could experience disruptions in our business 
a number of our key personnel in israel have standing obligations to perform periodical reserve duty in the israel defense forces and are subject to be called for active military duty at any time 
if our key personnel are absent from our business for a significant period of time  we may experience disruptions in our business that could affect the development  sales or technical support of our products 
as a result  we might not be able to compete in the market and our results of operations could be harmed 
because substantially all of our revenues are generated in us dollars  while a portion of our expenses is incurred in new israeli shekels  or nis  inflation in israel could harm our results of operations 
substantially all of our revenues are generated in us dollars  while a portion of our expenses  primarily salaries and personnel expenses related to our israeli facility  is in nis 
our israeli based employees salaries are influenced by inflation in israel 
as a result  any increase in the rate of inflation in israel may have a negative impact on our dollar measured operating results unless the inflation in israel is offset by a devaluation of the nis in relation to the us dollar 
in  the rate of inflation in israel was 
we cannot predict any future trends in the rate of inflation in israel or trends in the rate of exchange between the nis and the dollar 
if the dollar cost of our operations in israel increases  our dollar measured results of operations will be adversely affected 
israeli regulations may impact our ability to engage in research and development and export of our products in accordance with our current practices 
israeli law requires us to obtain a government license to engage in research and development of  and export of  the encryption technology incorporated in our products 
we currently have government licenses to engage in production of our encryption technology in our products in their and bit versions 
our research and development activities in israel would need to be modified to transfer this activity to our us development organization  and our current practice of exporting our products from israel to the us  with embedded encryption technology  would need to be changed if the israeli government revokes our current licenses  our licenses fail to cover the scope of the technology in our products  or israeli laws regarding research and development  export or use in general of encryption technologies were to change 
we currently benefit from government programs and tax benefits that may be discontinued or reduced 
we received grants and currently receive tax benefits under government of israel programs 
in order to maintain our eligibility for these programs and benefits  we must continue to meet specified conditions  including making specified investments in fixed assets and paying royalties with respect to grants received 
we may not be able to continue to meet all of these conditions 
in addition  some of these programs restrict our ability to manufacture particular products or transfer particular technology outside of israel 
if we fail to comply with these conditions in the future  the benefits received could be canceled and we could be required to refund any payments previously received under these programs or to retroactively pay tax on any income at a higher tax rate than that applying under these benefits 
the government of israel has reduced the benefits available under these programs in recent years and we cannot guarantee that these programs and tax benefits will continue in the future at their current levels or at all 
if the government of israel reduces or ends these tax benefits  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
it may be difficult to enforce a us judgment against us or our officers and directors  or to assert us securities laws claims in israel or serve process on our officers and directors 
we are incorporated in israel 
our chief executive officer and president resides in the united states under a pending application to adjust status to united states permanent resident  with an employment authorization document card 
the chairman of the board of our directors is a nonresident of the united states and a portion of our assets and the assets of these persons are located outside the united states 
therefore  it may be difficult to enforce a judgment obtained in the united states against us or any of those persons or to effect service of process upon these persons in the united states 
it may also be difficult to enforce civil liabilities under us federal securities laws in original actions instituted in israel 
the israeli companies law may cause uncertainties regarding corporate governance  israeli tax law may inhibit an acquisition of us 
the israeli companies law   which became effective on february   has brought about significant changes to israeli corporate law 
this law provides for new arrangements in various corporate areas  including shareholder voting rights  fiduciary obligations of shareholders and directors  mergers  tender offers  transactions involving related parties or significant shareholders  and anti takeover provisions 
until a body of case law develops with respect to this new law  uncertainties will exist regarding its interpretation 
these uncertainties could have the effect of inhibiting third party attempts to acquire us  and other transactions and decisions by or involving us 
israeli tax law treats some acquisitions  such as stock for stock exchanges between an israeli company and a foreign company  less favorably than united states tax law 
for example  israeli tax law may subject a shareholder who exchanges our ordinary shares for shares in another corporation to immediate taxation 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investing portfolio 
we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards such as money market funds  government securities  and commercial paper 
we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we do not expect any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio 
we conduct business in various foreign currencies  primarily in europe and the middle east 
as a result  we are exposed to the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the us dollar value of foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses 
we do not use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency denominated receivables 
looking forward  there can be no assurance that changes in foreign currency rates  relative to the us dollar  will not materially adversely affect our consolidated results
