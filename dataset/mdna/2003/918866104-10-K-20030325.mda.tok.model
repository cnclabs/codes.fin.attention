critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and estimates addressed below 
we also have other key accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions 
for additional information see note  significant accounting policies  of our annual report on form k for the year ended december  the company does not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets historically have been reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net cash flows estimated to be generated by such assets utilizing discount cash flow analysis 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
as described in note  goodwill and intangible assets of this form k  the accounting treatment for goodwill and other intangible assets changed effective january  revenue recognition revenue for newspaper delivered promotions is recognized in the period the product is distributed in the newspaper 
in accordance with industry practice  the company generally pre bills fsi customers in advance of the related distribution date

products and services not distributed via newspaper are recognized in revenue when the product is shipped or the service is performed
