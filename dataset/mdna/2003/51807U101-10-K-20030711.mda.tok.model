critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
product sales primarily consist of card sales and sales of read write drives 
the company recognizes revenue from product sales when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes revenue on product sales at the time of shipment when shipping terms are fob shipping point  orders are placed pursuant to a pre existing sales arrangement and there are no post shipment obligations or customer acceptance criteria 
where appropriate  provision is made at the time of shipment for estimated warranty costs and estimated returns 
the company s us government subcontract requires delivery to a secure  government funded vault built on company premises 
deliveries are made into the vault on a fixed schedule specified by the prime contractor 
at the time the cards are delivered to the vault  title to the cards transfers to the government  the prime contractor is invoiced  and payment is due according to normal trade payment terms 
however  revenue is recognized when the cards are shipped from the vault to the government unless the company receives a fixed schedule  notification  or plan for shipments out of the vault to the government  in which case revenue is recognized upon the latter of receipt of such fixed shipment schedule or delivery of the cards into the vault 
license revenue  which may consist of up front license fees and long term royalty payments  is recognized as revenue when realized 
the cost of license revenue  unless patent litigation is involved  is not material and is included in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
the company applies the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions to all transactions involving the sale of software products 
revenue from the license of the company s software products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software product has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured  and  if applicable  upon acceptance when acceptance criteria are specified or upon expiration of the acceptance period 
to date  software sales have not been significant to the company s business 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that management believes recovery is not likely  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent that a valuation allowance is established or increased in a period  the company must include an expense within the tax provision in the statements of income 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance of million as of march   due to uncertainties related to the company s ability to utilize some of the deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses attributable to stock option deductions carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on management s estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which the company operates and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
the company s methodology for determining the realizability of its deferred tax assets involves estimates of future income which assumes ongoing profitability of its core business and includes the estimated impact of future stock option deductions and the expiration dates and amounts of net operating loss carryforwards 
these estimates of future income are projected through the life of the related deferred tax assets using assumptions which management believes to be reasonable 
as of march   the company would require approximately million of future taxable income to realize the related deferred tax assets recognized as of march  in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or that these estimates are adjusted in future periods  the company may need to adjust the amount of the valuation allowance based on future determinations of whether it is more likely than not that some or all of its deferred tax assets will be realized 
an increase to the valuation allowance would require a corresponding amount recorded as additional income tax expense  while a decrease in the valuation allowance would be recorded as a credit to stockholders equity 
inventories 
the company values its inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the estimated forecast of product demand 
demand for read write drives can fluctuate significantly 
lasercard market growth could be limited and operating results could be harmed if the company is unable to produce and sell read write drives in volume 
in order to obtain favorable pricing  purchases of read write drive parts are made in quantities that exceed the historical annual sales rate of drives 
the company purchases read write drive parts for its anticipated read write drive demand and takes into consideration the order to delivery lead times of vendors and the economic purchase order quantity for such parts 
management s analysis of the carrying value of card and read write drive inventory is performed on a quarterly basis 
at march   read write drive parts  work in process  and finished goods inventory totaled million compared with million at march  during fiscal  the company sold approximately read write drives 
the company believes that the read write drive inventory as of march  is reflected at its net realizable value 
during fiscal  the company neared production ready status for a newer version of a read write drive 
the design change resulted in a lower cost model with enhanced functionality that is expected to fulfill the needs of a number of prospective customers 
this newer version  however  does not have a major function offered by the older drive model  which is therefore not obsolete 
many of the component parts of the previous read write drive model are also used in the new model 
however  the company determined that a write down of the other component parts not used by the new model was necessary since there are no current plans to manufacture additional units of the old model 
the company recorded a  charge in fiscal to write off these parts 
there are drives of the previous model in finished goods inventory that are available for purchase for the primary use as encoders in personalization systems 
in addition  there are drives of the new design in finished goods inventory 
during the first six months of fiscal  the company expects to purchase approximately  in read write drive parts and complete the assembly of an additional drives of the new design 
the company believes there is a market for both designs of its read write drives to support and expand optical card sales and  based on current proposals in process  that the read write drive inventory on hand at march   including parts to be received  will be ordered by customers 
for example  on april   the us department of homeland security issued a presolicitation notice for the purchase of approximately  optical stripe read write drives 
the company is also working  through a var  with the italian government regarding a national card identification program  in addition to supplying the company s optical memory cards for the program  the company expects that there will be demand for its read write drives necessary for encoding and initialization needs under the program 
the company believes that demand for such drives could be significant  but will ultimately depend on the nature and scope of deployment of the program 
if these anticipated drive orders do not materialize  the company may need to write down the value of its inventory for any potential excess quantities 
however  the company concluded that as of march   there was no need to write down the value of its read write drive inventory on hand 
in reaching this conclusion  the company considered the potential market demand  that the company is the only provider of read write drives that function with the company s cards  that the drives of the previous model provide a function not offered by the new model  and that the new model provides a solution for applications not requiring the encoding or initialization function 
with respect to inventory carrying values  the company follows the principles articulated in accounting research bulletin arb  chapter  inventory pricing  paragraphs through and and other authoritative guidance sab as it relates to determining the appropriate cost basis of inventory and determining whether firm  noncancelable purchase commitments should be accrued as a loss if forecasted demand is not sufficient to utilize all such committed inventory purchases 
as part of the company s quarterly excess obsolete analysis  management also determines whether lower of cost or market adjustments ie where selling prices less certain costs are not sufficient to recover inventory carrying values are warranted  to date  the company has not recorded any significant lower of cost or market adjustments 
in those instances where the company has recorded charges for excess and obsolete inventory  management ensures that such new cost basis is reflected in the statement of operations if that inventory is subsequently sold 
restatement of results for fiscal and first nine months of fiscal in connection with the company s audit for the fiscal year ended march   the company and its newly appointed independent accountants conducted an internal review of revenue recognition practices that were being followed as they related to a government subcontract 
this review  as more fully described in the company s report on form k dated may   resulted in accounting adjustments arising from changes in the timing of revenue recognition of lasercard optical memory card shipments into and out of a secure  government funded vault built for the government on company premises to comply with security regulations under the subcontract 
in the past  the company had recognized revenue upon deliveries to the vault since the customer takes title to the cards  assumes all risks of ownership  is obligated to remit payment for the cards at that time  and has no rights of return except for product defects 
however  the company s newly appointed independent accountants advised the company that under the terms and conditions of the company s us government supply subcontract  the transfer of title and the imminent cash payment pursuant to the contract payment terms upon delivery of the cards to the vault are necessary but not necessarily sufficient to recognize revenue upon delivery of cards to the vault  under the sec s staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition  and under the prior criteria set forth in the sec s accounting and auditing enforcement release no 
in the restated financial statements  revenue was recognized upon shipment of cards from the vault to the customer since the company had not been provided with a fixed schedule  notification  or plan for shipments out of the vault to the government 
the company restated previously issued results for fiscal years through and the first nine months of fiscal to reflect these adjustments in the timing of revenue recognition 
as a result of the restatement  revenue for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal declined  while revenue for fiscal and the first nine months of fiscal increased 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal and fiscal overview the company s principal lasercard market today involves high security  counterfeit resistant  tamper resistant cards for digital governance 
in this regard  the company provides governments with high security lasercard optical memory cards and read write drives to facilitate or expedite the process of governing by documenting the grant of certain rights to citizens and or non citizen permanent residents 
these counterfeit and tamper resistant cards are consumable products because they typically are replaced when the rights documented by the cards expire 
within this market  the company s largest customer for lasercard products is the united states government  representing of total revenues for fiscal year compared with of total revenues for fiscal and of total revenues for fiscal these revenues are predominantly the result of two card programs department of homeland security  previously the us immigration and naturalization service ins  permanent resident cards green cards and us department of state dos laser visa border crossing cards bccs 
sales of cards and read write drives for the canadian permanent resident card program represented of total revenues for fiscal and of revenues in fiscal when shipments began 
visx  incorporated  a non government customer since  represented of the company s fiscal revenues and near zero in fiscal the company anticipates orders for two programs in italy the cie card carta d identica elettronica and the pse card permesso di soggiorno elettronico 
the company has been informed by its italian var that the italian government plans to issue million cie cards and  pse cards this year through december however  the company has not as yet received any corresponding card orders 
potential applications for optical memory card digital governance programs in various countries include identification cards for saudi arabia and macedonia  motor vehicle registration cards in india  children s healthcare cards in the people s republic of china  and the expansion of current us government id card programs due to the increasing need for enhanced us border security 
since governmental card programs typically rely on government policy making  which in turn is subject to technical requirements  budget approvals  and political considerations  there is no assurance that these programs will be implemented as expected 
in addition to using its own marketing staff  the company utilizes value added reseller var companies and card distribution licensees for the development of commercial markets and applications for lasercard products 
product sales to vars and licensees consist primarily of the company s optical memory cards and optical card read write drives 
the company also offers for sale  its customized software applications and add on peripherals made by other companies such as equipment for adding a digitized photo  fingerprint  hand template  or signature to the cards 
the vars licensees may add application software  personal computers pcs  and other peripherals  and then resell these products integrated into data systems 
the company is continuing its efforts to recruit new vars and card distribution licensees and eliminate nonproductive vars 
revenues for the fiscal year ended march   the company s total revenues were  compared with  for fiscal and  for fiscal product revenues 
sales of lasercard r optical memory cards and related products totaled  for fiscal compared with  for fiscal and  for fiscal the changes in product revenues over these periods were due primarily to the sale of optical memory cards for two us government card programs  as described below 
for fiscal  the company sold lasercard products to approximately customers in six states and foreign countries 
the company sold million optical memory cards and approximately read write drives for fiscal compared with million optical cards and read write drives for fiscal and million cards and  read write drives for fiscal read write drive revenues decreased by million for fiscal compared with fiscal and by approximately million in fiscal as compared with fiscal read write drives comprised less than of total revenues during fiscal and fiscal and approximately of total revenues during fiscal of the  read write drives sold during fiscal  approximately drives were delivered mainly for the us department of defense automated manifest system as compared with approximately read write drives for fiscal and approximately drives for fiscal orders for this program have historically been sporadic 
the remaining decrease in read write drive deliveries was due to a reduction in sales to a visx  incorporated  a var 
sales of cards and drives to visx were negligible in fiscal  but represented of the company s fiscal revenues and in fiscal although some of visx s lasercard equipped surgery systems that are already installed at laser eye surgery clinics continue to use the company s optical memory cards  visx does not employ lasercard drives for system activation of its currently produced laser eye surgery equipment 
in addition to sales to other customers  the company anticipates delivery of approximately  read write drives for the department of homeland security during fiscal revenues during fiscal included sales of million green cards and laser visa bccs 
the company anticipates that fiscal revenues will include sales ranging from million to million cards for these programs 
in order to maintain card revenues at the fiscal level  fiscal revenues will need to include additional orders from new and existing programs 
such programs could include those in italy  macedonia  saudi arabia  and the united states government s us visit and twic programs 
license fees and other revenues 
the company entered into a read write drive kits assembly license with a customer in italy which generated license revenue of  during fiscal and  during fiscal the arrangement was structured whereby the customer agreed to pay us a contractually agreed upon fee in exchange for the transfer of technical knowledge and know how and training in the assembly of read write drives 
the training period extended over months  which is the period over which the company recognized the fee as revenue 
the company recorded revenue of  during fiscal and  in fiscal realized on digital sound patent licenses sold to sony corporation and dolby laboratories  inc the revenues were net of legal costs and third party contingency success fees 
there are no ongoing royalty payments 
fiscal license and other revenue included  representing the unamortized portion of a  nonrefundable distribution license fee received in from a licensee in asia that had committed to purchase a minimum number of optical memory cards for a program in the licensee s country 
the company recorded this fee as deferred revenue and has been amortizing it as revenue in proportion to the actual card purchases by the licensee 
during december  the company determined that  due to the licensee s failure to meet the minimum contractual purchase commitment  the licensee s distribution rights had become unenforceable and that the licensee would no longer be acting as the card supplier for that program 
in addition  at that time the company decided it would no longer work with the licensee under the terms of the license agreement 
since there were no further obligations  the company recognized the remaining  of revenue in the quarter ended december  fiscal license and other revenue also included  relating to a payment received in january from a third party that was considering entering into a license agreement with the company  the company originally recorded this payment as deferred revenue 
the third party had subsequently foregone its rights under this agreement due to non performance and accordingly  the company recognized revenue on this arrangement in the fourth quarter of fiscal backlog as of march   the backlog for lasercard optical memory cards totaled approximately million in firm card orders under card supply contracts  of which amount is for us government green cards or laser visas under a us government subcontract for the purchase of optical memory cards 
since the company had a fixed delivery schedule for card shipments out of a secure  us government funded vault on company premises  the company recognized revenues on the cards located in the vault  and therefore such cards were not included in backlog at march  as of march   the backlog for lasercard optical memory cards totaled approximately million  consisting of approximately million in firm card orders under card supply contracts  and approximately million in cards produced  delivered to  and located in the government funded vault 
of the million amount  was for us government green cards or laser visa bccs under the company s us government subcontract 
of the million amount  all were green cards or laser visa bccs produced under this subcontract 
the fluctuation in backlog for fiscal compared with fiscal is due to the receipt of fixed delivery schedules in fiscal  in addition to the fact that government release orders arrive at irregular intervals 
purchase order releases under the company s five year us government subcontract are issued at irregular intervals and for varying card quantities 
at march   the company had six months remaining on a january  release of million cards 
on may   the company announced a million order for canadian maple leaf permanent resident cards 
this order called for deliveries beginning in may gross profit excluding license and other revenue  the gross margin on product sales was for fiscal  for fiscal  and for fiscal historically  optical memory card gross margins have approximated 
optical memory card gross profit and margins can vary significantly based on average selling price  sales and production volume  mix of card types  production efficiency and yields  and changes in fixed costs 
as discussed below  read write drive gross margins are currently negative  inclusive of fixed overhead costs 
even if read write drive sales volume achieves profitable levels  the company believes that read write drive gross margins will remain below for the foreseeable future 
the decrease in gross margin on product sales for fiscal as compared to fiscal and fiscal was due largely to the initial production of cards for the canadian program under a new manufacturing process initiated by the company during fiscal  and the larger negative gross margin on read write drive sales discussed below 
optical memory cards 
the company depends on gross profit generated from optical memory card sales 
gross profit on optical memory card sales was about million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal the changes in gross profit from year to year was mainly due to changes in sales volume 
read write drives 
for fiscal  gross profit on read write drive sales decreased by about  to a negative gross profit of about  the negative gross margin for fiscal includes inventory write offs of about  and unabsorbed overhead costs that were charged to cost of product sales due to manufacturing volume being well below capacity during the year 
for fiscal  gross profit on read write drive sales decreased by about million  to a negative gross profit of about  compared with a gross profit of about  for fiscal the decrease for fiscal was due to lower selling prices for drives and lower sales volume to a level that does not fully absorb fixed manufacturing expenditures 
prior to fiscal  the company had been selling read write drives for less than three thousand dollars per unit in quantities of six or more  and these units generally included interface software 
in fiscal  the company reduced the selling price by for these read write drives for typical purchase quantities in an effort to develop a broader market and customer base for lasercard optical memory cards 
this reduced gross profit on read write drive sales in fiscal  and increased the level of sales required to achieve gross profits on read write drive sales  inclusive of fixed overhead costs 
the company believes that assembly and sales of approximately read write drives per quarter would be necessary to achieve a gross profit on read write drive sales at current selling prices and costs 
currently  in an effort to stimulate optical memory card sales  the company s priority is to increase the number of read write drives in the marketplace rather than maximizing per unit gross profit on read write drives 
the company has no plans to further lower read write drive prices for the current model 
the margin on the new drive model recently introduced by the company is expected to be similar to that of the current drive model 
the company believes that potential markets for read write drives include the us department of homeland security  the us department of state  the us armed forces  and the governments of canada  italy  and several other countries 
on april   the us department of homeland security issued a presolicitation notice for the purchase of approximately  optical stripe read write drives for delivery over a five month period beginning thirty days after contract award 
the company anticipates winning such award when granted 
the company maintains an inventory of read write drive parts and finished drives that it believes is adequate to meet customer demand 
however  an interruption in the supply of read write drive parts or difficulties encountered in read write drive assembly could cause a delay in deliveries of drives and optical memory cards and a possible loss of sales  which would adversely affect the company s operating results 
income and expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a 
sg a expenses were  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal the increase for fiscal compared with fiscal included approximately  for increased marketing and selling expenditures  an increase of  in general and administrative expenditures  an increase of  for insurance expenditures  and an increase of  for legal and accounting services 
the increase for fiscal compared with fiscal included approximately  for increased marketing and selling expenditures  an increase of  in general and administrative expenditures  and an increase of  in company k matching and company contribution to the employee stock purchase plan 
the company believes that sg a expenses for fiscal will be higher than fiscal levels  mainly due to increases in marketing and selling expenses  increases in insurance premiums and accounting and audit fees  and other general increases 
research and engineering expenses r e 
the company is continuing its efforts to develop new optical memory card features  including the insertion of contactless chips with radio frequency rf capability  optical memory card read write drives  read only drives readers  and software products in an effort to provide new products that can stimulate optical memory card sales growth 
for example  the company has developed a prototype of a lasercard handheld reader 
the company anticipates that these ongoing research and engineering efforts will result in new or enhanced card capabilities  production model read only drives  or drives with advanced security features and lower manufacturing costs  however  there is no assurance that such product development efforts will be successful 
these factors are important for the company s existing and future optical memory card markets 
total r e expenses were  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal the decrease for fiscal compared with is mainly due to a reduction in purchased services and prototype expenditures 
the increase in r e spending for fiscal was due to the increase in read write and read only drive manufacturing engineering and product development 
the company anticipates that r e expenses will increase during fiscal  primarily due to optical memory card read write drive development efforts 
other income 
total other income for fiscal consisted of  of interest income compared with  of interest income for fiscal and  of interest income in fiscal the difference for fiscal compared with fiscal is due to interest rate declines 
pretax profit 
for fiscal  pretax profit increased by million compared with fiscal due to the million increase in gross profit partially offset by the million increase in operating expenses 
pretax profit for fiscal decreased by million compared with fiscal due primarily to the million reduction in product gross profit  a million increase in expenses  and a million decrease in license revenue 
income taxes 
the company recorded an income tax expense of  for fiscal as compared to the income tax benefits of  for fiscal and  for fiscal as of march   the company had recognized all prior tax benefits for income statement purposes 
the income tax benefit for fiscal included a credit of  due to the change in the valuation allowance relating to the federal deferred tax asset  net of federal alternative minimum taxes  partially offset by  for state tax expense 
the income tax benefit for fiscal included a credit of  due to the change in the valuation allowance relating to the federal deferred tax asset  net of federal alternative minimum taxes  partially offset by  for state tax expense and  for foreign income taxes 
the company analyzes its deferred tax assets with regard to potential realization  as described above under critical accounting policies accounting for income taxes 
the company has established a valuation allowance on a significant portion of the deferred tax assets attributable to stock option deductions based upon the uncertainty of their realization 
any release of the remaining valuation allowance would be recorded as a credit to equity and would have no impact on net income 
the company has considered estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
all or some portion of the deferred tax asset that has been recognized would be reversed if it is determined that it is more likely than not that such portion would not be realized on the company s tax return 
there are timing differences between when certain items are included in book income and when the same items are included on income tax returns 
therefore  tax payments or credits often occur in different periods than when an income tax expense or benefit is included in the statements of income 
for income tax purposes  the company estimates that if these timing differences are fully realized on the tax return  future federal tax cash payments could be reduced by approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   the company had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of  a current ratio of to  and no long term debt 
the company also had  in long term investments with original maturities from to years 
net cash used in operating activities was  for fiscal compared with net cash provided by operating activities of  for fiscal  and  for fiscal the major categories comprising cash provided by used in operating activities are in thousands fiscal year net income    depreciation and amortization    increase decrease in deferred tax asset    increase in inventory  decrease increase in deferred revenue and advance payments from customers   decrease in deferred gross profit   other  cash provided by used in operating activities   the  increase in inventory during fiscal was largely due to a  increase in raw materials inventory for optical memory card manufacture  and a  increase in optical memory card finished goods inventory partially offset by a  decrease in optical memory card work in process inventory 
the advance payments from customer amount fluctuates with the amount of company backlog on which advance payments are received 
deferred revenue increases when cash is received for items on which revenue has not yet been recognized 
deferred revenue decreases when revenue is recognized on these items 
the company believes that the estimated level of revenues over the next months will be sufficient to generate cash from operating activities over the same periods 
however  quarterly fluctuations are probable 
operating cash flow could be negatively impacted to a significant degree if either of the company s largest us government programs were to be delayed  canceled  or not extended and not be replaced by other card orders or other sources of income  or if increases in product revenues or licenses do not keep pace with increased marketing and r e expenditures 
the company has not established a line of credit and has no current plans to do so 
the company may negotiate a line of credit if and when it becomes appropriate  although no assurance can be made that such financing would be available on favorable terms or at all  if needed 
as a result of the  net income recorded for fiscal  the company s accumulated deficit was reduced to  stockholders equity increased to  as a result of the net income recorded and  in additions to equity  mainly due to stock option exercises 
net cash used for investing activities was  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal these amounts include changes in the maturity of liquid investments  purchases of property and equipment of  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal  and increases in patents and other intangibles of  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal the company considers all highly liquid investments  consisting primarily of commercial paper  taxable notes  and us government bonds  with original or remaining maturities of three months or less at date of purchase  to be cash equivalents 
all investments with original or remaining maturities of more than three months but not more than one year at date of purchase  are classified as short term 
the company determines the length of its investments after considering its cash requirements and yields available for the type of investment considered by the company 
management also determines the appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates the classification of investments as of each balance sheet date 
as of march   the company had  classified as short term and long term investments  compared with  at march  all marketable securities were classified as held to maturity 
cash plus short term and long term investments were  at march  and  at march  the company added capital equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately million during fiscal compared with approximately million during fiscal and million during fiscal depending on card type  the company s card production capacity currently is approximately million cards per year 
the company plans to purchase additional production equipment in a series of steps when deemed appropriate by the company 
in addition to investment used for expansion  the company expects to make additional capital expenditures for cost savings  quality improvements  and other purposes 
the company plans to use cash on hand and cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures of about million during fiscal for equipment and leasehold improvements for card production  read write drive tooling and assembly  and general support items 
the majority of this proposed expenditure is slated for new card manufacturing equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for fiscal and  for fiscal compared with  used for financing activities for fiscal financing activities consisted of proceeds on sales of common stock through the company s stock option and stock purchase plans and cash used for purchases of common stock under a stock repurchase program  discussed below 
net cash provided by sales of common stock through stock plans were in the amounts of  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal during fiscal  the company commenced a share repurchase program under which up to  shares of common stock could be purchased by the company from time to time in nasdaq stock market transactions in an aggregate amount not exceeding million 
during fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal  the company used cash of  and  for this purpose and has since terminated this program without further activity 
there were no debt financing activities for fiscal   or item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risks interest rate risk 
the company invests its cash  beyond that needed for daily operations  in high quality debt securities 
in doing so  the company seeks primarily to preserve the value and liquidity of its capital and  secondarily  to safely earn income from these investments 
to accomplish these goals  the company invests only in debt securities issued by a the us treasury and us government agencies and corporations and b debt instruments that meet the following criteria x commercial paper rated a p or debt instruments rated aaa  as rated by the major rating services x can readily be sold for cash foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company sells products in various international markets
