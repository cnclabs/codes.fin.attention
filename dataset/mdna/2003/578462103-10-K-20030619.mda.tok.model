table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the discussion and analysis below contains trend analysis and other forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in any forward looking statements as a result of certain factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
the company filed a form k with the sec on january  indicating  among other things  its change in fiscal year end for financial reporting purposes  effective january   from a fiscal year ended on the saturday closest to january to the saturday closest to march the years ended march   february  and february  are referred to herein as fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the success of the company s operations depends to a certain extent on the ability of mall anchor tenants and other attractions to generate customer traffic in the vicinity of the mayor s stores 
the loss of mall anchor tenants in the regional malls where the mayor s stores are located  the opening of competing regional malls or stores and other economic downturns affecting customer mall traffic could have an adverse effect on the company s net sales and profitability 
the retail jewelry business is seasonal in nature with a higher proportion of sales and a significant portion of earnings generated during the third fiscal quarter holiday selling season 
restructuring plan during its fiscal year ended january  fiscal  the company embarked upon an expansion strategy that included opening five stores in fiscal  ten stores in fiscal and seven stores in fiscal merchandising and marketing issues  the poor economic climate and a capital intensive expansion strategy that the company executed in fiscal through fiscal served to force the company to retrench from that strategy as part of a restructuring plan that was adopted in the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal the restructuring plan which included  among other significant initiatives  an infusion of equity  the refinancing of the company s bank debt  the closing of thirteen unprofitable and under performing stores  the liquidation of certain non performing assets and the reduction of various field and corporate costs 
during fiscal  the company successfully executed the restructuring plan and was able to achieve the initiatives previously mentioned  at terms more favorable than originally estimated primarily through an equity infusion via the birks transaction described above  the refinancing of the company s bank debt  which increased borrowing availability and the closing of certain stores at more favorable terms than originally expected 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the amount and the percentage of net sales for certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations  as it relates to continuing operations  and other information year ended year ended year ended mar

 net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring  asset impairments and other charges depreciation and amortization goodwill impairment writedown operating income loss interest and other income interest and other financial costs loss from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle number of stores 
table of contents sales the company s net sales from continuing operations for fiscal were million compared to million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
comparative store net sales for fiscal  which includes all stores that were open during the year  decreased compared to fiscal the decrease in net sales for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to merchandising and marketing issues related to the company s significant reduction in available capital  the continued slowdown of the economy  the impact of decreased tourism and the fifteen store closures during fiscal thirteen stores identified as part of the restructuring plan and two other underperforming stores identified in fiscal  one of which is accounted for as a discontinued operation in accordance with new accounting rules 
sales from these closed stores were million in fiscal versus million in fiscal in addition  sales earlier in the fiscal year were negatively affected by certain suppliers withholding shipments  principally rolex  due to concerns regarding the company s liquidity 
subsequent to the equity investment on august  by birks  these suppliers resumed normal shipments and the company s relationship with these suppliers has greatly improved 
the decrease in net sales for fiscal compared to fiscal is due to merchandising and marketing issues coupled with the slowdown of the economy and the effects that the tragic events of september th had on the company s retail environment 
comparative store net sales for fiscal decreased compared to fiscal the retail jewelry market is particularly subject to the level of consumer discretionary income and the subsequent impact on the type and value of goods purchased 
with the consolidation of the retail industry  the company believes that competition both within the luxury goods retail industry and with other competing general and specialty retailers and discounters will continue to increase 
the luxury watch brands business comprises a significant portion of mayor s business  which is a result of the company s ability to effectively market high end watches 
during fiscal  watch sales constituted approximately of the company s total net sales with rolex sales alone comprising of total net sales in fiscal cost of sales and gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin in fiscal was compared to and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal is primarily due to low margin sales in connection with the liquidation of certain merchandise in the stores that were closed during fiscal as well as heavy discounting to generate cash flow prior to the birks equity investment 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal is primarily due to the liquidation of slow moving and discontinued inventory through caravan events that traveled through various stores 
the company s strategy is to increase gross margin and gross profit over the next several years 
areas for gross margin improvement include strategies to reduce the cost of merchandise purchased through leveraging the company s purchasing power and increasing sales of mayor s brand merchandise  and to move the mix of sales towards higher margin jewelry items 
in addition  by leveraging the relationship with birks and the new management at mayor s  the company expects to refine the allocation and management of inventory in its stores  and as a result  other direct costs such as slow moving inventory reserves are expected to decrease 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s strategy to increase gross margin and gross profit will be successful 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal compared to million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily a result of the closing of stores stores closed as part of the restructuring plan as well as two additional stores closed not identified in the restructuring plan  one of which is classified as a discontinued operation in accordance with new accounting rules as well as decreased advertising and marketing expenses due to capital constraints during the year and operating in fewer geographical markets due to the closing of stores outside the core florida and georgia marketplace 
the increase in fiscal is primarily a result of a full year s operations for stores opened in fiscal and the stores opened in fiscal restructuring  asset impairments and other charges other charges recorded in fiscal consist of one time charges primarily for professional fees related to the execution of the restructuring plan of approximately million  reserves related to sales tax liabilities of approximately million  severance costs related to the departure of the former chief executive officer of approximately million and charges related to the sale of certain of the company s accounts receivable of approximately million 
additionally  approximately million of reserves recorded in fiscal related to the exit of leases for closed stores were reversed to income due to the fact that the leases were terminated at costs more favorable than originally estimated 

table of contents restructuring  asset impairments and other charges for fiscal were million 
this includes consulting fees related to a strategic cost reduction project  non recurring legal fees associated with shareholder related matters  a write down of the corporate headquarters building which the company placed on the market for sale  the write down of the fixed assets for the stores that were included in the restructuring plan  and a reserve for early termination of the leases for the stores that were included in the restructuring plan 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses were million for fiscal  compared to million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in depreciation expense for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the disposal of fixed assets previously located at the corporate headquarters  which were sold on july   and no depreciation and amortization for fiscal related to the assets and goodwill written off in fiscal the increase in depreciation expense for fiscal was the result of the capital expenditures associated with the construction of new and remodeled stores 
goodwill impairment writedown the goodwill impairment income of million for fiscal relates to the reversal of excess tax reserves due to a settlement with the internal revenue service for less than the amount reserved 
the tax matters existed prior to the acquisition of mayor s jewelers  inc in and would have been reversed against goodwill  however  due to the fact that the goodwill was written off in fiscal the reversal is classified in the same line item as the impairment 
goodwill impairment writedown for fiscal was million 
management determined that the long term future cash flows did not support the carrying value and recorded an impairment charge to take the goodwill to zero 
interest and other income and interest and other financial costs interest and other income was million in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal  respectively 
other income for fiscal includes a payment of million received in connection with a settlement with former mayor s stockholders 
interest and other financial costs were million for fiscal  compared to million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in interest and other financial costs for fiscal is primarily attributable to the write off of financing costs for the former working capital facilities when the new credit facility and term loan were executed 
the increase in interest and other financial costs for fiscal is primarily attributable to the increase in the outstanding balance of the credit facility due to the build out of new stores and the incremental inventory needed to stock these stores 
income taxes the benefit in income taxes for fiscal of  is primarily a result of a refund claim to recover previously paid alternative minimum tax as a result of a change in tax law offset by a provision recorded for a settlement related to one of the company s subsidiaries 
the provision of million for fiscal is primarily the result of an increase in a valuation allowance to fully reserve the company s net deferred tax assets 
loss gain from discontinued operations the loss from discontinued operations for fiscal is made up of approximately million loss from operations and a million loss related to the closing of a store that was outside of mayor s core marketplace  and as such was classified as a discontinued operation 
the loss from discontinued operations for fiscal is related to the required reclassification of the store s net loss from operations to discontinued operations due to its classification in fiscal the net gain from discontinued operations in fiscal is related to a million gain from the disposal of a division of the company 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   the company had a million working capital credit facility with fleet retail finance and gmac and a million junior secured term loan with back bay capital 
both of the debt facilities have an expiration of august  and are collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets 
availability under the working capital facility is determined based upon a percentage formula applied to certain inventory and has certain restrictions regarding borrowing availability 
the interest rate under the working capital facility is prime plus  which was as of march  
table of contents as of march   after accounting for the foregoing borrowing restrictions  the company had approximately million of borrowing capacity and  after netting the outstanding borrowings of million and letter of credit commitments of  the company had excess borrowing capacity of approximately million 
the working capital facility currently contains certain financial covenants that limit capital expenditures 
the junior secured term loan currently bears an effective interest rate of and is subject to similar restrictions and covenants as the working capital facility 
during fiscal  cash flows from continuing operating activities used million in cash 
cash flows for discontinued operations used million in cash 
the use of cash for operating activities was primarily the result of the net loss for the year  the increase in inventories and other assets and the payout of restructuring costs offset by the reduction of accounts receivable and increase in accounts payable 
during fiscal  cash flows from continuing operating activities provided million in cash 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal  primarily related to the proceeds from the sale of the company s corporate headquarters  net of capital expenditures for the opening of two new stores 
fiscal capital expenditures also include back office computer software and hardware 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal due to capital expenditures 
net cash provided by financing activities of million is primarily related to the net proceeds from the birks equity investment of million and net proceeds from the sale of a majority of the credit card portfolio of million offset by the reduction of net borrowings under the credit facility of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal primarily due to net borrowings on the line of credit and tenant incentives from the opening of new stores 
management believes that barring a significant external event that materially adversely affects mayor s current business or the current industry trends as a whole  mayor s borrowing capacity under the credit facility  projected cash flows from operations and other short term borrowings will be sufficient to support the company s working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt service for at least the next twelve months 
effects of inflation gold prices are affected by political  industrial and economic factors and by changing perceptions of the value of gold relative to currencies 
investors commonly purchase gold and other precious metals perceived to be rising in value as a hedge against a perceived increase in inflation  thereby bidding up the price of such metals 
the company s sales volume and net operations are potentially affected by the fluctuations in prices of gold  diamonds and other precious or semi precious gemstones as well as watches and other accessories 
the company currently does not hedge its gold inventories 
hedging is not available with respect to possible fluctuations in the price of precious and semi precious gemstones  watches or other accessories 
the company s selling  general and administrative expenses are directly affected by inflation resulting in an increased cost of doing business 
although inflation has not had and the company does not expect it to have a material effect on operating results  there is no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
interest rate risk the company s credit facility accrues interest at floating rates  currently based upon prime plus 
the company manages its borrowings under this credit facility each day in order to minimize interest expense 
the impact on the company s earnings per share of a one percentage point interest rate change on the outstanding balance as of march  would increase or decrease earnings per share by approximately 
per share 
the company extends credit to its mayor s customers under its own revolving charge plan with up to three year payment terms 
finance charges are generally currently assessed on customers balances at a rate of per month 
since the interest rate is fixed at the time of sale  market interest rate changes would not impact the company s finance charge income 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results may differ from those estimates 
these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis and are based on historical experience and on various factors that are believed to be reasonable 

table of contents the company s accounting policies are more fully discussed in note b to the financial statements 
the company has identified certain critical accounting policies below 
allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated unmarketable inventory or slow moving inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value below cost based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of mayor s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
risk factors the company is controlled by a single stockholder 
birks  in connection with its investment in the company  was issued  shares of series a convertible preferred stock that upon conversion into common stock would give birks approximately a interest in the company 
birks  as the holder of such series a convertible preferred stock  is entitled to vote the number of votes equal to the number of votes it could cast if it converted all its shares of the series a convertible preferred stock into common stock 
additionally  birks  as the sole owner of such preferred stock  has the right to elect a percentage of the total authorized directors of the company  rounded to the next highest whole number  corresponding to the percentage of common stock that would be held by the holders on the record date of such election if the holders converted 
currently  birks has the right to elect seven of the nine members of the board of directors 
birks was also issued  in connection with its investment in the company  warrants to acquire additional shares of common stock  which  upon exercise  would increase birks interest in the company to approximately 
accordingly  birks can control the outcome of certain stockholder votes  including votes concerning the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions 
this level of concentrated ownership by one entity may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in the management or voting control of the company 
the company s stock price could be adversely affected if a large number of shares of the company s common stock were to be registered and sold 
in connection with birks investment in the company  the company has granted certain registration rights to birks  which entitles birks to cause the company to effect an unlimited number of registrations under the securities act of of sales of up to an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock that could be acquired by birks upon exercise or conversion of the securities it currently holds 
by exercising these registration rights birks could cause a large number of shares to be registered and become freely tradable without restrictions under the securities act except for those purchased in the offering by the company s affiliates immediately upon the effectiveness of such registration 
such sales may have an adverse effect on the market price of the common stock and could impair the company s ability to raise additional capital 
the company s business could be adversely affected if its relationships with any of its primary vendors are terminated 
the company s merchandising strategy depends upon its ability to maintain good relations with a few choice vendors 
certain brand name watch manufacturers  including rolex  have distribution agreements with the company that among other matters provide for specific sales locations  yearly renewal terms  and early termination provisions at the manufacturer s discretion 
the company competes with other jewelry retailers for access to vendors that will provide it with the quality and quantity of merchandise necessary to operate its business 
in fiscal  merchandise supplied by rolex  the company s largest supplier  accounted for approximately of the company s total net sales 
the company s relationships with its primary suppliers are generally not pursuant to long term agreements  including its relationship with rolex 
although the company believes that alternative sources of supply are available  the abrupt loss of any of its vendors  especially rolex  or a decline in the quality or quantity of merchandise supplied by its vendors could cause significant disruption in its business 
if rolex terminated its distribution agreement with the company  it would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
fluctuations in the availability and prices of the company s merchandise may affect its results of operations 
the company offers a large selection of distinctive high quality merchandise  including diamond  gemstone and precious metal jewelry  rings  wedding bands  earrings  bracelets  necklaces  charms  and its own private label jewelry 
accordingly  significant changes in prices of diamonds  gemstones  and precious metals required by the company could adversely affect the company s earnings 
further  both the supply and price of diamonds are significantly influenced by a single entity  diamond trading corporation 
the company does not maintain long term inventories or otherwise currently hedge against fluctuations in the cost of these materials 
a significant increase in the price of these materials could adversely affect the company s sales and gross margins 

table of contents a substantial portion of the merchandise the company sells is carried on a consignment basis prior to sale or is otherwise financed by vendors  thereby reducing the company s direct capital investment in inventory 
the willingness of vendors to enter into such arrangements may vary substantially from time to time based on a number of factors  including the merchandise involved  the financial resources of vendors  interest rates  availability of financing  fluctuations in gem and gold prices  inflation  the company s financial condition and number of economic or competitive conditions in the jewelry business or the economy 
any significant change in these relationships could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company s industry is highly competitive 
the retail jewelry business is mature and highly competitive 
the company s jewelry business competes with foreign and domestic guild and premier luxury jewelers  specialty stores  national and regional jewelry chains  department stores  and to a lesser extent  catalog showrooms  discounters  direct mail suppliers  television home shopping networks and jewelry retailers who make sales through internet sites 
the company s credit operations compete with credit card companies and other providers of consumer credit 
the company believes that competition in its markets is based primarily on trust  quality craftsmanship  product design and exclusivity  product selection  service excellence  and to a certain extent  price 
many competitors are substantially larger than the company is and have greater financial resources than the company 
the company may not be able to compete successfully with such competitors 
competition could cause the company to lose customers  increase expenditures or reduce pricing  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s earnings and stock price 
the company s quarterly operating results will fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors  and variation in quarterly results could cause the price of the company s common stock to decline 
the company s business is highly seasonal  with a significant portion of the company s sales and most of its sales generated during the third fiscal quarter  which includes the holiday shopping season 
sales in the third quarter of fiscal accounted for of annual net sales for such fiscal year 
the company has historically experienced lower net sales in the other fiscal quarters  and the company expects this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
a significant shortfall in results for the third quarter of any fiscal year could have a material adverse effect on the company s annual results of operations 
the company s quarterly results of operations also may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings  net sales contributed by new stores  increases or decreases in comparable store sales  timing of certain holidays  changes in merchandise  general economic conditions  industry and weather conditions that affect consumer spending  and actions of competitors 
the company s business is particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions 
jewelry purchases are discretionary for consumers and may be particularly affected by adverse trends in the general economy 
the success of the company s operations depends to a significant extent upon a number of factors relating to discretionary consumer spending  including economic conditions and perceptions of such conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment wages and salaries  business conditions  interest rates  availability  and cost of credit and taxation  for the economy as a whole and in regional and local markets where the company operates 
in addition  the company is dependent upon the continued popularity of malls as a shopping destination and the ability of malls or tenants and other attractions to generate customer traffic for the company s stores 
there can be no assurance that consumer spending will not be adversely affected by general economic conditions or a decrease in mall traffic  thereby negatively impacting the company s results of operations or financial condition 
a majority of the company s customers use credit either from the company s proprietary credit cards or another consumer credit source to purchase jewelry from the company 
when there are adverse trends in the general economy or increases in interest rates  fewer people use credit 
general economic trends also affect the company s credit operations 
the downturn in the general economy and the economic conditions in the markets in which the company operates could affect the company s ability to collect outstanding credit accounts receivable  which could have a material adverse affect on the company s financial condition 

table of contents the company s current levels of debt could impact its operations in the future 
the company s debt as of march  was approximately million 
the company s debt levels fluctuate from time to time based on seasonal working capital needs 
the degree to which the company is leveraged could impair the company s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general corporate purposes 
in addition  the company s credit facility includes negative covenants and financial covenants which could restrict or limit its operations 
a substantial portion of the company s indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating rates  and changes in interest rates could adversely affect the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company s credit business may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations governing its business 
the operation of the company s credit business subjects it to substantial regulation relating to disclosure and other requirements upon origination  servicing  debt collection and particularly upon the amount of finance charges it can impose 
any adverse change in the regulation of consumer credit could adversely affect the company s earnings 
for example  new laws or regulations could limit the amount of interest or fees the company could charge on consumer loan accounts  or restrict the company s ability to collect on account balances  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s earnings 
compliance with existing and future laws or regulations could require material expenditures or otherwise adversely affect the company s business or financial results 
failure to comply with these laws or regulations  even if inadvertent  could result in negative publicity  and fines  either of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the trading price of the company s common stock may be volatile 
the stock market  including the american stock exchange on which the shares of the company s common stock are listed  has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in addition  the market price of the company s common stock  like the stock prices of many publicly traded companies in the retail industry  has been and may continue to be highly volatile 
the company may not be able to retain key personnel or replace them if they leave 
our success is largely dependent on the personal efforts of thomas andruskevich  the company s chief executive officer  and certain other key members of the senior management team 
although the company has entered into employment agreements with mr 
andruskevich  and certain other key members of the senior management team  the loss of any of their services could cause the company s business to suffer 
the company s success is also dependent upon its ability to hire and retain qualified operations  development and other personnel 
competition for qualified personnel in the retail industry is intense  and the company cannot assure that we will be able to hire or retain the personnel necessary for its planned operations 
the company s business could be adversely affected if it is unable to successfully negotiate favorable lease terms 
all of the company s stores are leased 
as of may   the company had a total of leased stores 
the company s store leases are generally for a term of ten years  with rent being a fixed minimum base plus a percentage of the store s sale volume subject to certain adjustments over a specified threshold 
the company has generally been successful in negotiating leases for new stores and lease renewals as its current leases near expiration 
however  the company s business  financial condition  and operating results could be adversely affected if the company is unable to continue to negotiate profitable lease and renewal terms 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as discussed in more detail in item  the company s exposure to market risk is limited primarily to fluctuating interest rates associated with variable rate indebtedness that is subject to interest rate changes in the united states 
the company does not use  nor has it historically used  derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce market risk
