significant accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the company to estimate the effect of various matters that are inherently uncertain as of the date of the financial statements 
each of these required estimates varies in regard to the level of judgment involved and its potential impact on the company s reported financial results 
estimates are deemed significant when a different estimate could have reasonably been used or where changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  and would materially impact the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical estimates inherent in these accounting policies are discussed in the following paragraphs 
allowance for uncollectible accounts the company records an allowance for uncollectible accounts to reflect management s best estimate of losses inherent in its portfolio of receivables from cole licensed brands host stores  pearle vision franchisees and managed vision care accounts 
the allowance is established through a charge to the provision and represents amounts of current and past due receivable balances which management estimates will not be collectible 
the company calculates the allowance for uncollectible accounts using historical experience  current trends  credit policy and aging reports 
an analysis  including historical performance  break even analysis and payment arrangements is performed on delinquent accounts 
the company s calculation is reviewed by management to assess whether additional consideration is required to appropriately estimate losses in the receivable portfolio 
management believes its receivables are adequately reserved under current conditions 
any significant deterioration in the economic environment could materially affect these expectations 
valuation of inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market based on the first in  first out fifo method for the optical inventories and based on the weighted average cost method for the gift inventories 
the company records a reserve for future inventory cost markdowns to be taken for inventory not expected to be part of its ongoing merchandise offering 
the reserve is estimated based on historical information regarding sell through for similar products 
the company records a reserve for estimated shrinkage based on various factors including sales volume  historical shrink results and current trends 
management believes its inventories are appropriately valued 
valuation of long lived assets property and equipment  systems development  and other finite intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an initial screening is performed on all long lived assets 
store locations less than three years old and stores relocated within three years of fiscal year end are excluded from testing 
if the undiscounted future cash flows from the long lived asset are less than the carrying value  the company recognizes a loss equal to the difference between the discounted future cash flow and the carrying value 
management s estimate of future cash flow is based on our experience  knowledge and market data 
however  these estimates can be affected by factors such as future store profitability  real estate demand and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict 
goodwill  noncompete agreements and tradename assets were amortized over their estimated useful economic life using the straight line method and are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
beginning with fiscal year  all goodwill and tradename amortization ceased in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  and both goodwill and tradenames are tested at least annually for impairment 
the company adopted the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter for the annual impairment review 
valuation of deferred income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
management regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance for tax assets based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
in determining the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets  management estimates taxable income into the future 
the assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including the forecast of future taxable income and the evaluation of tax planning initiatives 
adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowance are made to earnings in the period when such assessment is made 
allowance for remakes and returns sales are recorded in accordance with the company s policy for revenue recognition and deferred revenue discussed in the summary of significant accounting policies 
revenues have been reduced by allowances for remakes of product and returns 
the estimated allowances are calculated as a percentage of sales and based upon historical return percentages 
managed vision underwriting results the company sells capitated managed vision care plans which generally have a duration of one year 
based upon its experience  the company believes that it can predict utilization and claims experience under these plans with a high level of confidence 
underwriting results are recognized using an estimated percentage of claims revenue 
each quarter  a portion of the resulting gain is reserved for potential variances between predicted and actual results 
the reserves are reconciled following the end of each plan year 
self insurance reserves due to the significant deductible under its insurance policies  the company is primarily self insured for property loss  workers compensation  automobile and general liability costs 
the liabilities are determined actuarially based on claims filed and estimates for claims incurred but not reported 
these liabilities are not discounted 
in estimating the obligation associated with incurred losses  the company utilizes loss development factors prepared by independent third party actuaries 
these development factors utilize historical data to project the future development of incurred losses 
loss estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims settlements and reported claims 
defined benefit retirement plans the plan obligations and related assets of defined benefit retirement plans are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using market quotations 
plan obligations and annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries and through the use of a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate and the estimated future return on plan assets 
in determining the discount rate  the company utilizes the yield on high quality  fixed income investments currently available with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of the benefit payments 
asset returns are based upon the anticipated average rate of earnings expected on the invested funds of the plans 
at february   the weighted average actuarial assumptions of the company s plans were discount rate  and long term rate of return on plan assets forward looking statements the company s management expects its continued emphasis on becoming better retailers to have a positive impact on the company s operations in fiscal however  the difficult economy and weak mall traffic negatively impacted store performance early in the fiscal year  and it is difficult to predict when the current conditions in the retail industry are likely to improve 
for the first quarter of fiscal  the company expects low single digit negative same store sales in the cole vision segment continuing similar trends seen in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company expects positive same store sales at things remembered for the first quarter of fiscal  compared to a negative fourth quarter in fiscal legal and accounting fees associated with the restatement  the resulting litigation and the sec inquiry and the litigation in california are likely to have a negative impact on results in fiscal the company s expectations and beliefs concerning the future contained in this document are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of actual results may differ materially from those forecasted due to a variety of factors that can adversely affect the company s operating results  liquidity and financial condition such as risks associated with potential adverse consequences of the restatement of the company s financial statements  including those resulting from litigation or government investigations  restrictions or curtailment of the company s credit facility and other credit situations  costs and other effects associated with the california litigation  the timing and achievement of improvements in the operations of the optical business  the results of things remembered  which is highly dependent on the fourth quarter holiday season  the nature and extent of disruptions of the economy from terrorist activities or major health concerns and from governmental and consumer responses to such situations  the actual utilization of cole managed vision funded eyewear programs  the success of new store openings and the rate at which new stores achieve profitability  the company s ability to select  stock and price merchandise attractive to customers  success of systems development and integration  competition in the optical industry  integration of acquired businesses  economic and weather factors affecting consumer spending  operating factors affecting customer satisfaction  including manufacturing quality of optical and engraved goods  the company s relationships with host stores and franchisees  the mix of goods sold  pricing and other competitive factors  and the seasonality of the company s business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s major market risk exposure is to changes in foreign currency exchange rates in canada and in euros  which could impact its results of operations and financial condition 
foreign exchange risk arises from the company s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because the company s reporting currency is the united states dollar 
management seeks to minimize the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations through natural internal offsets to the fullest extent possible 
a adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of investments and notes and interest receivables of million 
during the third quarter of the company entered into interest swap agreements to take advantage of favorable market interest rates 
these agreements require the company to pay an average floating interest rate based on six month libor plus to a counter party while receiving a fixed rate on million of the company s million senior subordinated notes due the agreements mature august  and qualify as fair value hedges 
the libor rate is reset in arrears 
the reset effective on february  for six month libor was and resulted in a rate of applied from the inception date of the swaps through february  at february  the fair value of the swap agreement was an unrealized gain of approximately million 
a change in six month libor would effect the interest cost associated with the million notional value of the swap 
a change approximately basis points in the market rates of interest for six month libor as compared to the rate in effect for fiscal would increase the company s annual interest cost by million 
in addition  the company is exposed to changes in the fair value of our debt portfolio  primarily resulting from the effects of changes in interest rates 
the company utilizes interest rate swaps to manage its exposure 
management believes that its use of these financial instruments is in the company s best interests 
the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes
