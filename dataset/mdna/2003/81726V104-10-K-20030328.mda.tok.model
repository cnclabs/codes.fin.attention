item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a holding company conducting business through two wholly owned operating subsidiaries  cmt and sentigen corp 
cmt is comprised of a service organization that provides contract research and development services  and a products organization that provides cell culture media  reagents and other research products to companies engaged in the drug discovery process 
sentigen corp 
is engaged in scientific research to develop assays for the screening of g protein coupled receptors  or gpcrs 
these assays potentially would have applications in drug discovery  micro array based detection technologies and environmentally sound pest management solutions for agricultural and human health vectors 
cmt operates through two divisions molecular cell science  or mcs and specialty media  or sm 
mcs provides contract research and development services and high throughput screening applications and services to companies engaged in the drug discovery process 
sm develops  manufactures  markets and sells specialty cell culture media  reagents and other research products 
significant accounting policies cell molecular technologies  inc we evaluate the performance of cmt through its two divisions both are treated as separate business segments 
revenue  income after direct costs and net income are used to measure and evaluate the financial results of cmt 
revenue recognition 
the mcs division s services are performed on a fee for service  fixed contract basis that provides for payments after specific research milestones are achieved 
revenues from the mcs division are recognized using the percentage of completion method for fixed price contracts extending over more than one accounting period 
work in process  representing time and costs incurred on projects in process in excess of amounts billed to customers  are recorded as unbilled services in our consolidated balance sheets 
unearned revenue represents amounts billed in excess of costs incurred and are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
revenues from the product sales of the sm division are recognized upon transfer of title to the product  which generally occurs upon shipment to the customer 
direct costs 
the following major classes of direct costs for the mcs division include costs incurred for direct materials used in the services performed under research contracts  an allocation of the compensation costs for the time incurred on such contracts by our scientists  an allocation of indirect materials costs for general laboratory expenses incurred for the benefit of all contracts in process  and an allocation of certain general and administrative expenses incurred by cmt 
the direct costs of the sm division represent the direct costs of research products sold  including an allocation of the compensation costs for production personnel  and an allocation of certain general and administrative expenses incurred by cmt 
the inventory of the sm division is determined using the fifo first in  first out method of accounting 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
the following major classes of selling  general and administrative expenses incurred by cmt include the compensation and employee benefit costs of cmt s management  sales  and administrative staff  the compensation and employee benefit costs for the time of scientific and production personnel spent on selling  general and administrative activities  facilities rental  utilities  communication costs and related operating expenses  marketing  sales and advertising costs  business travel expenses  commercial and product liability insurance costs  repairs and maintenance costs on facilities and laboratory equipment and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
sentigen corp 
the operations of sentigen corp 
are reflected as research and development expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
sentigen corp s operations  since its inception in february  consist entirely of research and development 
we expense research and development costs as such costs are incurred 
on august   sentigen corp 
was awarded a federal phase i grant in the amount of  from the national institute of health 
the term of the grant was from september  through february  the grant provides for the direct costs of a specific project within sentigen corp 
s overall research program budgeted in the grant for  as well as an allocation for the facilities and administrative costs of sentigen corp 
related to the project budgeted in the grant at 
as of december   sentigen corp 
completed the research project covered under the grant and all funds have been received from the national institute of health 
the receipt of grant funds was accounted for as revenue  the direct costs of the project were accounted for as direct costs and the related facilities and administrative costs were shown as operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
sentigen holding corp 
the expenses of sentigen holding corp 
are reflected as corporate overhead expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and include the following major classes compensation and employee benefits cost for our chairman of the board  chief financial officer  and administrative assistant  professional fees for legal and accounting services  office rental  utilities and communication costs  stock market listing fees and business travel expenses 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience and existing  known circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
specifically  management must make estimates in the following areas allowance for doubtful accounts 
we provide a reserve against our receivables for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay 
we determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts  aged receivables  historical losses and our customers credit worthiness 
amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve 
to minimize the likelihood of uncollectible accounts  customers credit worthiness is reviewed periodically based on our experience with the account and external credit reporting services if necessary and adjusted accordingly 
should a customer s account become past due  we generally place a hold on the account and discontinue further shipments or services to that customer  minimizing further risk of loss 
additionally  our policy is to fully reserve for all accounts with aged balances greater than one year 
reserves are fully provided for all expected or probable losses of this nature 
inventory adjustments 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we review the components of our inventory on a regular basis for excess  obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales 
our stock levels generally do not exceed one quarter s expectation of usage or sales 
inventories were stated at  and no reserve for impairment or obsolescence was necessary as of december  impairment of intangibles 
our intangible assets consist primarily of license costs of  as of december   and are the result of our exclusive licensing agreement with the trustees of columbia university 
the value of the license reflects the closing share price of our common stock on april  the closing date of our agreement with the trustees of columbia university less accumulated amortization 
the value of the license is subject to an amortization period of years 
we review the value of the license for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable 
a review for impairment includes comparing the carrying value of the license to an estimate of the undiscounted net future cash inflows over the life of the license 
the license is considered to be impaired when the carrying value exceeds the calculation of the undiscounted net future cash inflows or fair market value 
an impairment loss in the amount of the excess would be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations if the carrying value exceeded the fair market value of the license 
we believe no such loss is necessary as of december revenue recognition 
revenues from the mcs division are recognized using the percentage of completion method for fixed price contracts 
percentage of completion is determined based on the proportion of completed costs to total anticipated costs on each contract 
we use estimates of remaining costs to complete each contract to determine the revenue and profitability on each contract 
we reevaluate these estimates periodically and such reevaluations may  in the future  lead to changes in the rate of profitability on each contract 
there were no contracts where the expected costs exceeded the contract price 
all contract receivables are due within one year 
stock based compensation 
sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  encourages  but does not require companies to record compensation cost for stock based employee compensation plans at fair value 
we continue to account for stock based compensation to employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
apb no 
requires no recognition of compensation expense for the stock based compensation arrangements provided by us where the exercise price is equal to the market price at the date of the grants 
options issued to non employees are valued at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measurable 
the expense for options issued to non employees is recorded as stock based compensation in our consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
results of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  were  compared to revenue of  for the year ended december  this increase of  or  was the result of an increase of  or  in contract revenue from cmt s mcs division  an increase of  or  in revenue from cmt s sm division  and a federal phase i grant award from the national institute of health to sentigen corp 
for  other than the federal phase i grant award received by sentigen corp  our revenues for were entirely attributable to the operations of cmt and its two divisions  mcs and sm 
an analysis of our revenues during from the mcs division is as follows for the year ended december  percent change hts contract   all other contracts   total   the increase from the mcs division was due in part to the renegotiation  as of january   of a significant contract for high throughput screening  or hts  services from a pay per service contract to a retainer contract 
the new retainer contract provides for payments of  per month  regardless of the volume of services performed 
the term of the contract was for one year and ended on december  we provided more hts services to this customer during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  and  under the old pay per service agreement  would have also shown an increase in revenues from this contract 
on december  this contract was renewed for a term of one year and provides for payments of  per month beginning in january the growth from other contracts was driven by mouse genetics services  protein expression services and services for the pre clinical analysis of compound efficacy on diminishing or eliminating pathogen infection 
revenues from the sm division grew for the year ended december  from the year ended december  this growth was driven by four factors an increase in sales of the sm division s line of murine embryonic stem cells and feeder cells as well as media associated with this product line  increase in sales of the sm division s proprietary formulations sold under private label  an increase in sales to japan through the sm division s distributor  the research products division of dainippon pharmaceuticals  and price increases implemented as of january  income after direct costs and gross margin 
income after direct costs for the year ended december  was  compared to income after direct costs of  for the year ended december  gross margin for the year ended december  excluding income after direct costs from the federal phase i grant award received by sentigen corp 
was compared to for the year ended december  this increase was driven by reduced direct materials costs for the mcs division  offset in part by rising serum costs in the sm division 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  this increase of  or  was primarily attributable to an increase of  in selling  general and administrative expenses due to the increased rental and facilities expenses relating to the opening of cmt s new facility in phillipsburg  new jersey  as well as increases in salaries and employee health insurance expenses at cmt  and increases in cmt s advertising  marketing and sales costs 
a portion of the increase in operating expenses also was due to an increase of  in depreciation and amortization due to capital expenditures made in connection with cmt s new facilities and an increase of  in stock based compensation 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of  in the research and development costs of sentigen corp 
due to the receipt of the grant from the national institute of health  and a decrease of  in corporate overhead driven by reduced professional fees 
loss from operations 
loss from operations for the year ended december  was  compared to a loss from operations of  for the year ended december  the components of this improvement were as follows for the year ended december  percent change cmt   sentigen corp 
  holding company expenses   total   income from operations for cmt increased by which was due to its increase in revenues 
loss from operations attributable to sentigen corp 
improved by which was due to the grant award from the nih  offset by higher stock based compensation costs 
sentigen corp s operations consist entirely of research and development activities 
loss from operations attributable to holding company related expenses improved by which was largely attributable to lower professional fees 
interest income 
interest income  net of interest expenses declined by  or  due to the fall in yields on us treasury and money market securities 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues 
revenue for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  this increase of  or  was the result of an  or  increase in revenues from the mcs division and a  or  increase in revenues from the sm division 
revenue growth through mcs was attributable to more aggressive hts programs employed by our customers 
revenues from the mcs division also grew in part due to increased sales and marketing efforts 
revenue growth through sm was attributable to a more effective sales and marketing program  increased business from companies private labeling our media  and increased sales of our cell line based products 
income after direct costs and gross margin 
income after direct costs for the year ended december  was  compared to income after direct costs of  for the year ended december  gross margin for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  this increase was due to pricing increases implemented at the beginning of and a shift in our revenue mix towards sales of higher margin contract r d relationships and media products 
operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative costs of cmt increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase of  or  was attributable to the increased infrastructure costs resulting from our new north wales  pennsylvania facility  additional hiring of new employees and increased sales and marketing activity 
research and development costs increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  prior to may  we did not conduct significant research activities 
consequently  research and development costs for the year ended december  represent only seven months of activity 
corporate overhead increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the  or  increase was attributable to higher personnel and professional costs 
non cash charges for stock based compensation decreased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the decrease of  or  was attributable to certain changes we made to the consulting agreements with our scientific consultants 
under our new agreements  dated december   the consultants remaining unvested options will vest based on the sole discretion of our board of directors 
the amendments to the agreements constituted a change in accounting resulting in low charges for non cash stock based compensation for the unvested options of these consultants  accounting for the decrease 
depreciation and amortization increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the increase of  or  was attributable to the increased equipment expenditures in associated with the build out of cmt s new north wales  pennsylvania facility  and its expansion at the marshall street  phillipsburg  new jersey site 
interest income  net of interest expenses increased by  which was directly attributable to the investment of proceeds from our november private placement 
our income tax provision increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to the increase in our income from operations  primarily as a result of increased income from cmt 
as a result of the foregoing  our net loss increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources at december  we had  in cash   in investment securities and working capital of  during the year ended december  we financed our operations primarily through working capital and we financed capital expenditures through bank loans 
we believe our financial resources will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  we may  in the future  need to obtain additional debt or equity financing to meet our liquidity needs 
it is possible that any such financing may be dilutive to our stockholders and the terms of any debt financings likely could contain restrictive covenants limiting our ability to do certain things  including paying dividends 
our ability to obtain financing depends upon the status of our future business prospects  as well as conditions prevailing in the capital markets 
cell molecular technologies  inc in october  cmt leased equipment for use in the performance of certain contracts in the mcs division 
the lease qualified for treatment as a capital lease for accounting purposes 
at the inception of the lease  we recorded the equipment on our balance sheet and an offsetting capital lease liability of  we used fixed interest rate of to approximate the borrowing rate for the lease 
the equipment will be depreciated on a straight line basis through the term of the lease that expires in september through december   we made rental payments of  of those payments  we applied  to the capital lease liability and  to interest expense 
as of december  the total remaining lease obligation amounted to  during the first quarter of we leased approximately  square feet of laboratory space to accommodate cmt s high throughput screening applications and assay development services group 
in connection with this new facility  cmt borrowed  under a  loan commitment to finance capital equipment expenditures 
in march  cmt borrowed the remaining  available under this loan commitment to finance capital expenditures made in connection with our new facility in phillipsburg  new jersey 
we are required to repay this loan  which bears interest at a fixed rate of  over a seven year period that commenced in june the terms of the loan require cmt to maintain annual cash flow equal to to times the total annual debt service of cmt and a ratio of debt to net worth of to 
cmt complied with these terms as of and for the year ended december  sentigen holding corp 
guarantees this obligation of cmt 
the unpaid principal balance on this loan at december  was  five stockholders and one affiliate of a stockholder advanced an aggregate of  to cmt in the promissory notes had an interest rate of  payable at maturity  and had an original due date of july  as a result of the cmt merger  the above loans maturity dates were accelerated to may  during  the stockholders agreed to extend the above loans maturity date to may  in july  the stockholders agreed to further extend the maturity date of the loans until september   at which time we repaid principal and interest of  to retire these obligations 
sentigen corp 
in june  sentigen corp 
borrowed an additional  under its existing  loan facility 
this facility has a term of five years  may be used to finance capital expenditures and bears interest at 
sentigen holding corp 
guarantees this obligation of sentigen corp 
the loan also requires that sentigen holding corp 
keep unencumbered liquid assets equaling two times the combined outstanding loan balances for sentigen and cmt 
as of december  and the date of filing of this report  sentigen corp 
had borrowed a total of  under this facility  and the unpaid principal balance on this loan at december  was  on february  we renegotiated the interest rate on this borrowing from the fixed rate of to a variable interest rate 
the variable interest rate is the prime plus with a minimum interest rate of 
sentigen corp 
was formed in february of and is focusing on research and development activities 
our licensing agreement with the trustees of the columbia university in new york required us to contribute a minimum of  into sentigen corp 
within one year of the date of the agreement by april or we must have been involved in active negotiations to raise  in additional funding 
we satisfied this provision through the consummation of our private placement in november in which we sold  shares of our common stock at per share for aggregate gross proceeds of another provision of the agreement calls for a minimum of  per six month period or  per annual period to be spent on bona fide research and development of the patents and licenses subject to the agreement from the second through the fourth years of the agreement april through april or we must be involved in active negotiation to raise  in additional funding 
we satisfied this provision through april and the second and third fiscal years of the license agreement 
we believe that we have enough capital resources to meet the financial requirements of this provision for the agreement years and beyond 
there is no assurance that the technology involved in the research and development activities related to the licensing agreement with the trustees of columbia university will prove to be productive 
in the event we decide to terminate such activities  there will be associated costs to us  such as payment to employees and expenses related to the closing of our facility at broadway  new york  new york 
no provisions have been made for such possible further expense 
commitments under debt obligations and leases we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of and for the year ended december  principal maturities of long term debt over the next five years are as follows december   thereafter  the estimated future minimum rental payments under capital and operating type leases over the next three years are as follows capital operating for the year ending december    minimum rental payments   less interest portion of rental payments  capital lease obligation  inflation inflation has historically not had a material effect on our operations
