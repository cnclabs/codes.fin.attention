item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business strategy is to emphasize increasing operating cash flow and improving profitability at each business location through strategies that carry out our culture of service and leadership excellence 
we do not expect our strategy will require significant investments of new capital over the next two years 
we plan to continue reducing our debt and improving our leverage ratios 
our focus is on continuing to improve our organizational leadership and quality of personnel 
successful execution during and has  in our view  positioned the company as a leader in our industry and improved our financial flexibility 
we expect to replace our revolving credit facility during and prior to its maturity in june we expect to resume selective acquisitions later in a reconciliation of the company s revenues and earnings for the year ended december  to the year ended december  is as follows comparison of earnings year ended dec

 excluding reversal of deferred tax valuation allowance    reversal of deferred tax valuation allowance  reported year ended december     critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that effect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  realization of accounts receivable  intangible assets  property and equipment and deferred tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience  third party data and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these considerations form the basis for making judgments about the amount and timing of revenues and expenses  the carrying value of assets and the recorded amounts of liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change 
historical performance should not be viewed as indicative of future performance  as there can be no assurance the margins  operating income and net earnings as a percentage of revenues will be sustained consistently from year to year 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements presented herewith  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
funeral and cemetery operations we record the sales of funeral merchandise and services when the funeral service is performed 
sales of cemetery interment rights are recorded as revenue in accordance with the retail land sales provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
this method generally provides for the recognition of revenue in the period in which the customer s cumulative payments exceed of the contract price related to the real estate 
costs related to the sales of interment rights  which include property and other costs related to cemetery development activities  are charged to operations using the specific identification method in the period in which the sale of the interment right is recognized as revenue 
revenue from the sales of cemetery merchandise and services are recognized in the period in which the merchandise is delivered or the service is performed 
revenues to be recognized from the delivery of merchandise and performance of services related to contracts that were acquired in acquisitions are typically lower than those originated by the company and are likely to exceed the cash collected from the contract and received from the trust at maturity 
allowances for customer cancellations  refunds and bad debts are provided at the date of sale based on our historical experience 
in addition  we monitor changes in delinquency rates and provide additional bad debt and cancellation reserves when warranted 
when preneed funeral services and merchandise are funded through third party insurance policies  we earn a commission on the sale of the policies 
insurance commissions are recognized as revenues when the commission is no longer subject to refund  which is typically one year after the policy is issued 
preneed funeral contracts deferred preneed funeral contracts revenue cash proceeds from preneed funeral sales are deposited to a trust or to purchase of a third party insurance product 
unperformed guaranteed preneed funeral contracts are included in the consolidated balance sheets as preneed funeral contracts 
the balance in this asset account represents amounts due from customer receivables and third party insurance companies  and the amounts deposited with the trustee and the accumulated earnings on these deposits 
a corresponding credit is recorded to deferred preneed funeral contracts revenue 
the funeral revenue is not recorded until the service is performed 
the trust income earned and the increases in insurance benefits on the insurance products are also deferred until the service is performed  in order to offset inflation in cost to provide the service in the future 
deferred obtaining costs deferred obtaining costs consist of sales commissions and other direct related costs of originating preneed sales contracts 
these costs are deferred and amortized into funeral and cemetery costs and expenses over the expected timing of the performance of the services or delivery of the merchandise covered by the preneed contracts 
effective october   we adopted an actuarial method that more closely matches the expected maturity of the preneed contracts 
the effect of this change was to reduce expense in the fourth quarter of by approximately million and for the year by approximately million from that which would have been recorded using the prior amortization method 
goodwill and other intangible assets the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired  as determined by management in transactions accounted for as purchases  is recorded as goodwill 
many of the acquired funeral homes have provided high quality service to families for generations 
the resulting loyalty often represents a substantial portion of the value of a funeral business 
goodwill is typically not associated with or recorded for the cemetery businesses 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we review the carrying value of goodwill at least annually on a regional basis to determine if facts and circumstances exist which would suggest that this intangible asset might be carried in excess of fair value 
fair value is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows of the businesses in each region at the company s weighted average cost of capital less debt allocable to the region 
the calculation of fair value can vary dramatically with changes in estimates of the number of future services performed  inflation in costs and the company s cost of capital 
if impairment is indicated  then an adjustment will be made to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill to fair value 
pursuant to the implementation of sfas no 
as discussed in the accounting changes section below  the company no longer amortizes goodwill effective as of the beginning of amortization of goodwill recorded during the years ended december  and totaled million and million  respectively 
income taxes the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated us federal income tax return 
we record deferred taxes for temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
for  the company had an effective financial statement tax rate of percent  reflecting the benefit of previously unrecognized tax losses from prior periods related to the fresh start restructuring program 
when the company incurred the fresh start restructuring costs and write downs in late  the company recorded a valuation allowance to offset these tax benefits until such time that it could be determined that the company would be able to deduct them 
management determined in the first quarter of that it is more likely than not that the company will be able to utilize substantially all of these previously unrecognized tax benefits 
accordingly  in the first quarter of the company eliminated substantially all of the valuation allowance which resulted in a tax benefit in the amount of million  equal to per diluted share 
the company recorded income taxes at the effective rate of percent in  excluding the affect of the reversal of the deferred tax valuation allowance 
had the company also used the percent tax rate for the year ended december   net income for that period  including the related tax effect of the change in accounting for goodwill amortization discussed above  would have been lower by million or per diluted share 
the company has operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax reporting purposes see note to the consolidated financial statements 
stock options and employee stock purchase plan the company has four stock option plans currently in effect under which stock options may be issued 
additionally  the company sponsors an employee stock purchase plan espp under which employees can purchase common stock at a discount 
the stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair market value of the company s common stock 
substantially all of the options granted under the four stock option plans have ten year terms 
the options generally vest over a period of two to four years 
the company accounts for stock options and shares issued under the espp under apb opinion no

the provisions of this statement would be effective beginning with carriage s third quarter of selected income and operational data the following table sets forth certain income statement data for carriage expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the periods presented year ended december  total revenues  net total gross profit general and administrative expenses operating income  excluding special charges interest expense  net the following table sets forth the number of funeral homes and cemeteries owned and operated by carriage for the periods presented year ended december  funeral homes at beginning of period acquisitions or openings divestitures  mergers or closures of existing funeral homes funeral homes at end of period cemeteries at beginning of period acquisitions divestitures cemeteries at end of period the following is a discussion of carriage s results of operations for   and for purposes of this discussion  the company s locations are in three groups  as a result of the annual stratification of our funeral home and cemetery portfolios 
a core group  which represents approximately two thirds of our revenues and cash flow  a second underperforming group  and a third group consisting of businesses that are targeted for sale 
the term same store refers to funeral homes and cemeteries owned and operated for the entirety of each period being compared 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  funeral home segment 
the following sets forth certain information regarding carriage s net revenues and gross profit from our funeral home operations during the years ended december  and year ended december  change amount percent dollars in thousands location same store revenues core   underperforming   targeted for sale   total same store revenue   acquired  sold and closed    preneed insurance commissions revenue    total net revenues    field ebitda    field ebitda margin gross profit same store gross    acquired  sold and closed preneed insurance commissions revenue    total gross profit    not meaningful 
funeral same store revenues for the year ended december  increased when compared to the year ended december   as we experienced a decrease of in the number of services and an increase of in the average revenue per service for those existing operations 
the decrease in the number of services compares favorably with the reported decline in the national death rates for the increase in the average revenue per service  which equated to  was hampered by an increase from to in the percentage of funeral services involving cremations  which generally have a lower sales value 
the average revenue for cremation services increased from year to year 
the number of funeral services decreased for the core group in comparing to  and the average revenue per service for those existing locations increased in comparing those same periods 
the number of funeral services performed by the underperforming group decreased while the average revenue per service increased in comparing to in addition to the net revenues from funeral location operations above  insurance commission revenues from preneed funeral contract sales totaled million for  as compared to million for  primarily due to nonrecurring commissions in the prior year period on the conversion of trust funded contracts to insurance funded contracts 
total funeral same store gross profit for the year ended december  increased million or from the comparable year of the higher gross profit is primarily due to the elimination of goodwill amortization which totaled million during the year ended december  total funeral field ebitda for the year ended december  decreased million or from the comparable prior year  the largest factor for which was the contribution associated with businesses we sold during as a percentage of revenue  the field ebitda margin for the year ended december  of declined compared with the prior year period

in particular  we experienced a decrease in preneed sales of interment and entombment sites from million to  and a decrease of million in finance charges earned on preneed receivables 
income from trust funds was substantially the same in both years 
total gross margin increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  gross margin in the current year period benefited by a lower bad debt experience 
other general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million as compared to the year ended december  these expenses  as a percentage of net revenues  increased from to primarily because of a million charge related to the termination of an employment agreement with a former officer and million in professional fees incurred in connection with changes in tax accounting methods during excluding these two unusual charges  general and administrative expenses totaled of net revenues 
higher salaries and benefits accounted for the remaining increase in year over year expenses 
interest expense and other financing costs for the year ended december  declined slightly compared to the year ended december  primarily because average debt outstanding was less than the average debt outstanding in the same period for additional amortization in the amount of million was recorded in because of the reduction in the maximum principal available under the company s revolving credit facility from million to million and paydowns on the senior notes 
income taxes the following table sets forth the components of the provision benefit of income taxes for the company for the year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  amount percent of pretax income amount percent of pretax income provision for income taxes before the reduction of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance   reduction of deferred tax asset valuation allowance  total provision benefit for income taxes   the company has a net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes

because of the ability to use the net operating loss to offset taxable income and the timing of when revenue and expenses are recognized for tax purposes  we do not expect to pay federal income taxes in and year ended december  compared to year ended december  funeral home segment 
the following sets forth certain information regarding carriage s net revenues and gross profit from our funeral home operations during the years ended december  and year ended december  change amount percent dollars in thousands location same store revenues core    underperforming    targeted for sale   total same store revenue    acquired  sold and discontinued    preneed insurance commissions revenue    total revenues    field ebitda    field ebitda margin gross profit same store gross profit    acquired  sold and discontinued preneed insurance commissions revenue    total gross profit    not meaningful 
funeral same store revenues for the year ended december  were up when compared to the year ended december   as we experienced a decrease of in the number of services and an increase of in the average revenue per service for those existing operations 
the lower total net revenues were primarily a result of the decline in revenues related to the businesses that we have sold during and the number of funeral services decreased for the core group in comparing to  while the average revenue per service for those existing locations increased in comparing the two years 
the number of funeral services for the underperforming group decreased while the average revenue per service increased in comparing to in addition to the net revenues from funeral location operations above  insurance commission revenues from preneed funeral contract sales totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenue in included higher than normal level of commissions resulting from the conversion of previously sold trust funded contracts to insurance funded contracts 
commissions received from new sales of preneed funeral insurance were also higher than in these commissions are recorded when they have been held beyond their refund period  which is generally one year 
total funeral same store gross profit for the year ended december  increased million or from the year ended december  the higher gross profit is due primarily to depreciation and amortization that was million less than the prior period due to the impairments recorded in the latter half of cemetery segment

the higher same store gross profit reflected an increase of million from core operations and million from cemeteries that have been targeted for sale 
total gross margin increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   primarily due to a higher level of deliveries of previously contracted preneed merchandise and services  increased property sales and improved business practices 
other general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   decreased million or from as a percentage of net revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in resulting from the downsizing of the corporate organization and other cost saving initiatives of fresh start 
interest expense and financing costs for the year ended december   decreased million or from while the average debt outstanding during was less than the average debt outstanding during  we experienced higher amortization of loan costs in due to debt modification fees incurred late in the year additionally  the amount of interest capitalized on construction in progress declined from  in to  in there were no special charges for the year ended december  special charges and other charges for the year ended december   were million as discussed in the overview section above 
preferred dividends of  for and  for were subtracted from net income in computing earnings attributable to common stockholders for purposes of computing basic and diluted earnings per common share 
we provided for tax benefits and income taxes on income before income taxes at a combined state and federal tax rate of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the sale of properties in and generated substantial losses for income tax purposes 
the low tax rate for the year was due to the limitation on the tax benefit  of the losses deducted in  to the amount that can reasonably be expected to be refunded in the foreseeable future from carrybacks of the tax loss 
the rate for benefited from the utilization of tax benefits that were generated in the fourth quarter of  those tax benefits are recognized when realized through taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december  and at december  it is carriage s practice to apply available cash balances against its revolving line of credit to minimize interest expense 
if the company needs cash for working capital or investment purposes  it can draw upon available capacity under its million revolving line of credit  such availability being million as of december  for the year ended december   cash provided by operations was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the higher level of cash provided by operations during was primarily due to million in tax refunds received in and catch up trust withdrawals in the period totaling million that normally would have been withdrawn during the year 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to cash provided from investing activities in the amount of million for december   the change being primarily due to the higher amount of proceeds from the sales of businesses during as compared to cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to cash used in financing activities in the amount of million for december   the change being primarily due to the higher amount of payments on debt in which funds were available from the sales of businesses during as compared to debt the company s debt at december  totaled million and consisted of million in senior notes  a million revolving credit facility million outstanding at december  and million in acquisition indebtedness and capital lease obligations 
the credit facility matures in the senior notes are unsecured  mature in traunches of million in  million in and million in and bear interest at the fixed rates of  and  respectively 
the senior note agreement additionally requires that a significant portion of any proceeds from the sales of assets be offered to the note holders as prepayment of the amounts outstanding 
these prepayments are made at par value 
prepayments were made in the amount of million and million during and  respectively  related to the proceeds from sales of assets 
the company has a revolving credit facility with a group of banks 
the credit facility is unsecured and contains customary restrictive covenants  including a restriction on the payment of dividends on common stock  and requires that we maintain certain financial ratios 
the company met all financial covenants at december  interest under the credit facility is provided at both libor and prime rate options 
as of december   the company s debt to total capitalization was percent as compared to percent at december  during october  management voluntarily reduced the capacity of the revolving line of credit from million to million to reduce bank fees on a portion that is not expected to be used 
with the lower capacity  the company has million available to draw under the credit facility 
we do not have any liquidity sources or financing arrangements with unconsolidated or limited purpose entities in which we may be economically or legally required or reasonably likely to fund losses of an unconsolidated  limited purpose entity  provide it with additional funding  issue securities pursuant to a call option held by that entity  purchase the entity s capital stock or assets  or otherwise may be financially affected by the performance or non performance of an entity or counterparty to a transaction or arrangement 
in particular  we do not expect to be required to fund any unrealized or realized losses in the preneed trust funds 
preferred stock as of december   we had  shares of series d preferred stock issued and outstanding 
during  we redeemed  shares in a noncash exchange in connection with the sale of certain businesses to the holder of those shares at value of per share 
effective december   we redeemed the remaining  shares at a redemption price of per share 
on june   the company s subsidiary  carriage services capital trust  completed the sale of  units of convertible preferred securities  with a maturity of years  resulting in approximately million in net proceeds that are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets as company obligated mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of carriage services capital trust 
dividends are tax deductible and may be deferred at our option for up to five years 
for purposes of debt ratios  under our revolving credit and senior note agreements  the convertible preferred securities are treated as equity 
significant uses of cash during the company modified its approach to marketing preneed funeral contracts to emphasize insurance products over trust products  eliminate the national and regional overhead management structure  and outsource a significant portion of the administration 
these changes significantly reduced the cash investment that has historically been required to generate this backlog of business 
in  million of preneed funeral sales were generated for a cash outlay of million 
in  million of preneed funeral sales were generated for a cash outlay of million 
in  million of preneed sales were generated for a cash outlay of million 
during the twelve months ended december   the company incurred approximately million in capital expenditures  primarily related to refurbishing and improving funeral home facilities and construction of lawn crypts and mausoleums at cemeteries 
the company believes that cash flow from operations and borrowings under the credit facility should be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures as well as other ongoing operating requirements 
during  the company spent approximately million for the acquisition of two funeral homes 
other investing activities for included the final payment in the amount of million related to a performance based contingent purchase price payment 
acquisition spending during was limited to a performance based contingent consideration payment on a prior year acquisition 
the company anticipates that the capital expenditures in will primarily be limited to those that are required to maintain the revenue capability of its existing businesses 
it does not anticipate making significant capital expenditures to grow or enhance new revenue streams or acquire new businesses 
because future cash flows and the availability of financing are subject to a number of variables  there can be no assurance that the company s capital resources will be sufficient to fund its capital needs 
additional debt and equity financings may be required in the future 
the availability and terms of these capital sources will depend on prevailing market conditions and interest rates and the then existing financial condition of the company 
obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements  as well as other financial commitments 
where appropriate we have indicated the footnote to our annual consolidated financial statements where additional information is available 
payments by period in millions contractual obligations footnote reference total after years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases noncompete agreements total contractual cash obligations related party transactions two of the company s directors are prior owners of previously unrelated businesses that carriage acquired in as an incentive  the company entered into arrangements with the directors to pay them of the amount by which the annual field level cash flow exceeds predetermined targets on certain businesses in their respective geographic region through  with a final payment equal to a multiple of six times the average of the last three years payments 
the business purpose of the arrangements was to incentivise the directors to provide carriage with high quality acquisition targets and to have input in the competitive strategies of those businesses post acquisition so that cash flows grow over time 
the terms were determined by reference to similar arrangements within the death care industry 
the incentives earned by the two directors totaled   and  for the years  and  respectively 
in connection with the acquisition of two funeral homes from a group of individuals  one of which is one of the directors referred to in the preceding paragraph  a portion of the purchase price of each of those funeral homes was to be payable based on a formula related to the annual field level cash flows subsequent to the year of acquisition 
the business purpose was to determine the final purchase prices of the acquisitions since both were expected to show strong growth in cash flow 
the terms were negotiated by the sellers  one of which later was appointed to director of carriage 
the contingent purchase price payments paid to the director totaled  and  during the years and  respectively 
the final contingent purchase price payment of  was paid in march  of which  was paid to the director 
the company rents office space  at an annual rate of  per year through  from an entity in which one of the company s directors has a financial interest 
the terms were determined by reference to rentals of similar office space in the area 
seasonality although the death care business is relatively stable and fairly predictable  our business can be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the death rate 
generally  death rates are higher during the winter months 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the results of carriage s operations 
forward looking statements in addition to historical information  this annual report contains forward looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements include any projections of earnings  revenues  asset sales  cash flow  debt levels or other financial items  any statements of the plans  strategies and objectives of management for future operation  any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance  any statements of belief  and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing 
forward looking statements may include the words may  will  estimate  intend  believe  expect  project  forecast  plan  anticipate and other similar words 
cautionary statements we caution readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future  could affect  our actual consolidated results and could cause our actual consolidated results in the future to differ materially from the goals and expectations expressed in the forward looking statements above and in any other forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
risks related to our business earnings from and principal of trust funds and insurance contracts could be reduced by changes in stock and bond prices and interest and dividend rates 
earnings and investment gains and losses on trust funds and insurance contracts are affected by financial market conditions that are not within our control 
earnings are also affected by the mix of fixed income and equity securities that we choose to maintain in the funds  and we may not choose the optimal mix for any particular market condition 
the size of the funds depends upon the level of preneed sales and maturities  the amount of investment gains or losses and funds added through acquisitions  if any 
declines in earnings from perpetual care trust funds would cause a decline in current revenues  while declines in earnings from other trust funds and insurance contracts could cause a decline in future cash flows and revenues 
in addition  any significant or sustained investment losses could result in there being insufficient funds in the trusts to cover the cost of delivering services and merchandise or maintaining cemeteries in the future 
any such deficiency would have to be covered by cash flow  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
as of december   net unrealized depreciation in the funeral  cemetery merchandise and perpetual care trust funds amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
see note in our consolidated financial statements 
unrealized gains and losses in the funeral trust funds and cemetery merchandise trust funds have no immediate impact on our revenues  margins  earnings or cash flow  unless the fair market value of the funds were to decline below the estimated costs to deliver the underlying products and services 
if that were to occur  we would record a charge to earnings to record the expected loss currently 
over time  gains and losses realized in the funds are allocated to underlying preneed contracts and affect the amount of the trust fund earnings to be recognized when we deliver the underlying product or service 
accordingly  if current market conditions do not improve  the funds may eventually realize losses  and our revenues  margins  earnings and cash flow would be negatively affected by the reduced revenue when we deliver the underlying products and services 
in addition  any significant or sustained investment losses could result in there being insufficient funds in the trusts to cover the cost of delivering services and merchandise or maintaining cemeteries in the future 
any such deficiency would have to be covered by cash flow  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
see note increased costs may have a negative impact on earnings and cash flows 
cost increases may impair our ability to achieve revenue growth that exceeds our cost increases 
our plan assumes that we will be successful in increasing revenues at a rate that is greater than the growth in the cost of sales 
although we believe we can achieve that goal  we can give no assurance that we will be successful in doing so in we expect insurance costs  in particular  to increase substantially in the terrorist attacks in the united states on september  and related subsequent events have resulted in higher insurance premiums 
the volume of claims made in such a short span of time resulted in liquidity challenges that many insurers have passed on to their policyholders 
additionally  insurers have increased premiums to offset losses in equity markets due to recent economic conditions 
while our insurance costs are expected to increase materially  the actual increase in insurance costs cannot be predicted 
our ability to achieve our debt reduction targets and to service our debt in the future depends upon our ability to generate sufficient cash  which depends on many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
our ability to achieve our debt reduction targets in the time frame projected by us depends upon our ability to generate sufficient cash from two main sources disposing of underperforming assets and locations  and our ongoing operations 
we expect to generate cash proceeds from disposing of assets and locations which depends upon our ability to negotiate transactions on acceptable terms and conditions with qualified buyers who can obtain third party financing 
our ability to generate cash flow from operations depends upon  among other things  the number of deaths in our markets  competition  the level of preneed sales and their maturities  our ability to control our costs  stock and bond market conditions  and general economic  financial and regulatory factors  most of which is beyond our control 
we may experience declines in preneed sales due to numerous factors including changes made to contract terms and sales force compensation  or a weakening economy 
declines in preneed sales would reduce our backlog and revenue and could reduce our future market share 
in an effort to increase cash flow  we modified our preneed sales strategies early in fiscal year by increasing finance charges  requiring larger down payments and shortening installment payment terms 
we also changed the compensation structure for our preneed sales force 
these changes  and the accompanying sales force attrition and adverse impact on sales force morale  caused preneed sales to decline 
although we do not anticipate making further significant changes in these areas  we may decide that further adjustments are advisable  which could cause additional declines in preneed sales 
in addition  a weakening economy that causes customers to have less discretionary income could cause a decline in preneed sales 
declines in preneed cemetery property sales would reduce current revenue  and declines in other preneed sales would reduce our backlog and future revenue and could reduce future market share 
increased preneed sales may have a negative impact on cash flow 
preneed sales of cemetery property and funeral and cemetery products and services are generally cash flow negative initially  primarily due to the commissions paid on the sale  the portion of the sales proceeds required to be placed into trust or escrow and the terms of the particular contract such as the size of the down payment required and the length of the contract 
in fiscal year  we changed the terms and conditions of preneed sales contracts and commissions and moderated our preneed sales effort in order to reduce the initial negative impact on cash flow 
nevertheless  we will continue to invest a portion of cash flow in preneed acquisition costs  which reduces cash flow available for other activities  and  to the extent preneed activities are increased  cash flow will be further reduced  and our ability to service debt could be adversely affected 
price competition could reduce market share or cause us to reduce prices to retain or recapture market share  either of which could reduce revenues and margins 
our funeral home and cemetery operations generally face intense competition in local markets that typically are served by numerous funeral homes and cemetery firms 
we have historically experienced price competition primarily from independent funeral home and cemetery operators  and from monument dealers  casket retailers  low cost funeral providers and other non traditional providers of services or products 
in the past  this price competition has resulted in losing market share in some markets 
in other markets  we have had to reduce prices thereby reducing profit margins in order to retain or recapture market share 
increased price competition in the future could further reduce revenues  profit margins and the backlog 
increased advertising or better marketing by competitors  or increased activity by competitors offering products or services over the internet  could cause us to lose market share and revenues or cause us to incur increased costs in order to retain or recapture our market share 
in recent years  marketing through television  radio and print advertising  direct mailings and personal sales calls has increased with respect to the sales of preneed funeral services 
extensive advertising or effective marketing by competitors in local markets could cause us to lose market share and revenues or cause us to increase marketing costs 
in addition  competitors may change the types or mix of products or services offered 
these changes may attract customers  causing us to lose market share and revenue or to incur costs in response to competition to vary the types or mix of products or services offered by us 
also  increased use of the internet by customers to research and or purchase products and services could cause us to lose market share to competitors offering to sell products or services over the internet 
increases in interest rates would increase interest costs on our variable rate long term debt and could have a material adverse effect on our net income and earnings per share 
as of december   million of our long term debt was subject to variable interest rates  although that amount was fixed pursuant to the terms of interest rate swaps expiring in may accordingly  any significant increase in interest rates  could increase our interest costs on our variable rate long term debt  which could decrease our net income and earnings per share 
covenant restrictions under our revolving credit facility and senior notes limit our flexibility in operating our business 
our revolving credit facility and the senior notes contain  among other things  covenants that limit  among other things  our ability to borrow money  pay dividends or distributions  purchase or redeem stock  make investments  engage in transactions with affiliates  engage in sale leaseback transactions  effect a consolidation or merger or sell  transfer  lease  or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all assets  and create liens on assets 
we must also stay within specified limits of financial ratios  such as a debt to capital ratio  debt to ebitda ratio  and fixed charge coverage ratio 
events beyond our control  including changes in general economic and business conditions  may affect our ability to satisfy these covenants 
a breach of any of those covenants could result in a default allowing the lenders to declare all amounts immediately due and payable 
our projections for include adjustments to earnings and cash flow for estimated disposition activity 
several important factors  among others  may affect our ability to consummate dispositions 
our projections for include adjustments to earnings and cash flow for estimated disposition activity 
the actual level of disposition activity  if any  will depend not only on the number of properties sold  but also on the size of the businesses sold 
several important factors  among others  may affect our ability to consummate sales 
we may not be able to find a sufficient number of buyers at prices we are willing to sell 
risks related to the death care industry declines in the number of deaths in our markets can cause a decrease in revenues 
changes in the number of deaths are not predictable from market to market or over the short term 
declines in the number of deaths could cause at need sales of funeral and cemetery services  property and merchandise to decline  which could decrease revenues 
although studies estimate that the number of deaths in the united states will increase by approximately percent per year to  longer lifespans could reduce the rate of deaths  and appear to be doing so currently 
for example  data obtained from the centers for disease control and prevention cdc indicate a decrease in deaths in the united states of percent during our fiscal year ended december   compared to the same period in the prior year 
in addition  changes in the number of deaths can vary among local markets and from quarter to quarter  and variations in the number of deaths in our markets or from quarter to quarter are not predictable 
these variations can cause revenues to fluctuate 
our comparisons of the change in the number of families served to the change in the number of deaths reported by the cdc from time to time may not necessarily be meaningful 
the cdc receives weekly mortality reports from cities and metropolitan areas in the united states within two to three weeks from the date of death and reports the total number of deaths occurring in these areas each week based on the reports received from state health departments 
the comparability of our funeral calls to the cdc data is limited  as reports from the state health departments are often delayed  and the cities reporting to the cdc are not necessarily comparable with the markets in which we operate 
nonetheless  we believe that the cdc data is the most comprehensive data of this kind available 
the increasing number of cremations in the united states could cause revenues to decline because we could lose market share to firms specializing in cremations 
in addition  basic cremations produce no revenues for cemetery operations and lesser funeral revenues and  in certain cases  lesser profit margins than traditional funerals 
our traditional cemetery and funeral service operations face competition from the increasing number of cremations in the united states 
industry studies indicate that the percentage of cremations has steadily increased and that cremations will represent approximately percent of the united states burial market by the year  compared to percent in the trend toward cremation could cause cemeteries and traditional funeral homes to lose market share and revenues to firms specializing in cremations 
in addition  basic cremations with no funeral service  casket  urn  mausoleum niche  columbarium niche or burial produce no revenues for cemetery operations and lower revenues than traditional funerals and  when delivered at a traditional funeral home  produce lower profit margins as well 
if we are not able to respond effectively to changing consumer preferences  our market share  revenues and profitability could decrease 
future market share  revenues and profits will depend in part on our ability to anticipate  identify and respond to changing consumer preferences 
during the last three years  we have implemented new product and service strategies based on results of customer surveys that we conduct on a continuous basis 
however  we may not correctly anticipate or identify trends in consumer preferences  or we may identify them later than our competitors do 
in addition  any strategies we may implement to address these trends may prove incorrect or ineffective 
because the funeral and cemetery businesses are high fixed cost businesses  positive or negative changes in revenue can have a disproportionately large effect on cash flow and profits 
companies in the funeral home and cemetery business must incur many of the costs of operating and maintaining facilities  land and equipment regardless of the level of sales in any given period 
for example  we must pay salaries  utilities  property taxes and maintenance costs on funeral homes and maintain the grounds of cemeteries regardless of the number of funeral services or interments performed 
because we cannot decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when we experience declines in sales  declines in sales can cause margins  profits and cash flow to decline at a greater rate than the decline in revenues 
changes or increases in  or failure to comply with  regulations applicable to our business could increase costs or decrease cash flows 
the death care industry is subject to extensive regulation and licensing requirements under federal  state and local laws 
for example  the funeral home industry is regulated by the federal trade commission  which requires funeral homes to take actions designed to protect consumers 
state laws impose licensing requirements and regulate preneed sales 
embalming facilities are subject to stringent environmental and health regulations 
compliance with these regulations is burdensome  and we are always at risk of not complying with the regulations or facing costly and burdensome investigations from regulatory authorities  regardless of the merit thereof 
in addition  from time to time  governments and agencies propose to amend or add regulations  which could increase costs or decrease cash flows 
for example  federal  state  local and other regulatory agencies have considered and may enact additional legislation or regulations that could affect the death care industry 
as discussed in item under the heading regulation  senator dodd has recently proposed legislation that  if adopted  would more heavily regulate the death care industry 
if adopted  this bill could result in an increase in our costs 
several states and regulatory agencies have considered or are considering regulations that could require more liberal refund and cancellation policies for preneed sales of products and services  limit or eliminate our ability to use surety bonding  increase trust requirements and prohibit the common ownership of funeral homes and cemeteries in the same market 
if adopted by the regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate  these and other possible proposals could have a material adverse effect on us  our financial condition  our results of operations and our future prospects

quantitative and qualitative market risk disclosure carriage is exposed to market risk primarily related to potential adverse changes in interest rates as discussed below 
management is actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and developing and utilizing appropriate risk management techniques 
we are not exposed to any other significant market risks including commodity price risk  nor foreign currency exchange risk 
carriage is currently exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
our variable rate long term borrowings primarily consist of the million outstanding under our million floating rate line of credit maturing in any change in the floating rate will cause a change in interest expense 
we seek to minimize the risk that interest rates will increase by entering into interest rate swap transactions 
as of december   we were engaged in two interest rate swaps in which we exchange the floating rate payments for fixed rate payments at day intervals 
the interest rate swaps have a combined notional amount of million  mature in may  and have a weighted average fixed rate of and a negative fair value of million at december  the fair values of the swaps are recorded as a liability in the balance sheet at december  any decrease in market interest rates  assuming all other things being equal  causes the fair value of our interest rate swaps to decrease 
the remainder of carriage s long term debt and leases consist of non interest bearing notes and fixed rate instruments 
any increase in market interest rates causes the fair value of those liabilities to decrease
