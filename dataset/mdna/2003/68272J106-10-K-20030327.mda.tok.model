overview onesource provides primarily web based business and financial information products and services to professionals who need quick access to timely and reliable company  industry  and market intelligence 
onesource was formed as a division of lotus development corporation in and became an independent company when it was purchased in a management buy out in until december  onesource s business was to provide business information to the financial community using cd rom technology as the primary method of distribution 
the introduction of the business browser product line in december marked a fundamental shift in the business as onesource began a transition away from its legacy cd rom business and toward web based products 
the onesource business browser product line is designed to be a comprehensive and easy to use business and financial information resource  integrating over  sources of business information from more than business and financial information providers and onesource s own corptech high technology company database 
the onesource product line also includes the applink software development kit  which allows business browser customers access business browser content with their own internal applications 
these applications may be internally developed or utilize third party software  and typically apply to corporate intranets  portals  or customer relationship platforms 
on october   onesource acquired corporate technology information services  inc  a delaware corporation located in woburn  massachusetts 
corporate technology information services  inc is a provider of high technology company profiles with a focus on emerging private companies 
pursuant to the terms of an agreement and plan of merger  the consideration paid by onesource was million in cash 
for financial statement purposes  this acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  the results of operations of corporate technology information services  inc subsequent to october  have been included in onesource s consolidated statements of operations 
in may  onesource sold its cd insurance division to allow onesource to focus more completely on its new web based product line 
onesource recognized a gain of million on this sale during in addition  in connection with the disposition  onesource licensed certain of its cd rom software to the acquiror in exchange for million of license fees 
these license fees were paid in eight equal quarterly installments beginning january  and ending on december  and were recognized ratably as other income 
for each of the years ended december  and  onesource recorded million of other income related to the software license agreement 
revenues from both cd rom and web based products generally consist of monthly subscription fees from customer contracts 
customer contracts span varying periods of time but are generally for one year  are renewable for like periods  and are payable in advance 
subscription fees generally are quoted to clients on an annual basis but are earned as revenues on a monthly basis over the subscription period 
invoices are recorded as accounts receivable until paid and as deferred revenues until earned 
deferred revenues attributable to web based products increased to million as of december  from million as of december  and increased from million as of december  cost of revenues consists primarily of royalties to information providers and  to a lesser extent  employee salaries and benefits  facilities allocation and related expenses  depreciation associated with computers for data processing and on line requirements  amortization of capitalized software development costs  and web hosting expenses 
onesource enters into contracts with information providers  which are generally for a term of at least one year and are automatically renewable if not canceled with advance notice 
these contracts may be terminated under certain circumstances 
under these agreements  royalties are generally paid on a quarterly basis to information providers 
royalties are generally calculated as a flat percentage of onesource revenues  as a per user fee that declines as the number of authorized users of the product increases  as a fixed fee per period  or in some cases  as a calculated fee based upon product growth compared to like periods from the prior year 
royalties are recorded as deferred royalties and are expensed as revenues are earned over the term of the contract period 

table of contents selling and marketing expense consists primarily of employee salaries and benefits and sales commissions paid to onesource s sales force  customer support organization  and marketing personnel  as well as facilities allocation and related expenses  direct marketing promotional materials  trade show exhibitions and advertising 
sales commissions are paid when customers are invoiced  recorded as deferred commissions  and expensed as revenues are earned over the term of the contract period 
all other selling and marketing costs are expensed as incurred 
platform and product development expense consists primarily of employee salaries and benefits  facilities allocation and related expenses  as well as outside contractor expenses  relating to the development of the platform of core software supporting onesource products and the development of new products based upon that platform 
platform and product development expense includes expenses relating to the editorial staff that implements the global business taxonomy to integrate disparate information sources into the onesource web based products 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of employee salaries and benefits  facilities allocation and related expenses associated with onesource s management  finance  purchasing  human resources  legal  management information systems  and administrative groups 
critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates onesource s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon onesource s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires onesource to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  onesource evaluates its estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
onesource believes the following accounting policies are most critical to fully understanding and evaluating its financial results  as well as the areas of more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
onesource products are generally sold on a subscription basis pursuant to customer contracts that span varying periods of time  but are generally for a period of one year 
onesource initially records accounts receivable and defers the related revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenues are recognized ratably over the related subscription period beginning when access to products is granted to the customer in accordance with customer agreements 
onesource believes that this policy significantly reduces subjectivity in determining the timing of revenue recognition 
software development costs 
platform and product development costs  other than certain software development costs  are charged to expense as incurred 
onesource has adopted statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  which requires research and development costs associated with the application development stage to be capitalized for internal use software 
examples of capitalized software development projects are software platforms used in onesource products and programs used for its proprietary classification system 
management is required to use professional judgment in determining whether development costs meet the criteria in sop for immediate expense or capitalization 
capitalized software is amortized over its estimated useful life of three years 
management periodically reviews the carrying value of the projects that have been capitalized to determine if impairment may exist 
if it is determined that the carrying value of the asset has been impaired  the value will be reduced by a charge to operations in the amount of the impairment 
deferred royalties and commissions 
deferred royalties and commissions include sales commission and royalty costs that are associated with securing a subscription and procuring information to be delivered 
table of contents over the subscription period  respectively 
these costs are deferred and amortized ratably over the associated subscription period as a component of selling and marketing expense and cost of revenues  respectively 
if a contract relating to the procurement of information used in the onesource products is terminated prematurely  for any reason  expense recognition may be accelerated and incurred sooner than originally anticipated 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
onesource assesses collectibility of accounts receivable based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  past transactions history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
onesource does not request collateral from its customers 
onesource maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of onesource s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
intangible assets 
intangible assets consist of goodwill  trademark  non compete agreement  subscriber list  and a database 
intangible assets  excluding goodwill  are amortized using the straight line method over periods of three to seven years  based on the estimated useful life 
the carrying value of other intangible assets is reviewed on a quarterly basis for the existence of facts or circumstances both internally and externally that may suggest impairment 
for other intangible assets  onesource determines whether an impairment has occurred based on gross expected future cash flows  and measures the amount of the impairment based on the related future estimated discounted cash flows 
to date  no such impairment has occurred 
factors which onesource considers important and that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the cash flow estimates used to determine the impairment  if any  contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  onesource ceased amortizing goodwill as of january  and will annually review the goodwill for potential impairment in the third quarter  as well as on an event driven basis  using a fair value approach 
since onesource constitutes one reporting unit under sfas no 
 its fair value  which equals its market capitalization based on the closing price of its common stock as quoted on the nasdaq national market  is compared to its net assets  which includes the carrying value of goodwill 
if market capitalization exceeds net assets  it is determined that no impairment has occurred and no adjustment is required 
income tax 
onesource records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
at december   onesource has provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of its net deferred tax assets 
while onesource has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event onesource were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination was made

 percentage of total revenues revenues web based product cd rom product and other total revenues cost of revenues web based product cd rom product and other total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing platform and product development general and administrative restructuring amortization of goodwill amortization of other intangible assets total operating expenses income from operations annualized contract value one measure of the performance of onesource s business is annualized contract value 
annualized contract value is a measurement that onesource uses for normalized period to period comparisons to indicate business volume and growth  both in terms of new customers and upgrades and expansions at existing customers 
onesource s presentation and calculation of annualized contract value may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
it is not an absolute indicator  and onesource cannot guarantee that any annualized contract value will be ultimately realized as revenues 
onesource uses annualized contract value as a measure of its business because it shows the growth or decline in onesource s customer base in a way that revenues cannot 
since onesource s business is primarily subscription based  revenues are recognized not when a sale is made  but in ratable portions over the term of the subscription which is usually twelve months 
as a result  from a revenue viewpoint the addition or loss of even a major customer contract may not have a dramatic impact on a quarter to quarter basis 
on the other hand  by looking at the value of customer contracts in hand at the end of each quarter  onesource can more readily see trends in its business 
for example  the addition of a one year subscription contract with total payments of million may only increase revenues by approximately  million divided by four in the quarter in which the sale is made  but would increase annualized contract value by million 
similarly  if the customer did not renew that contract  revenues in the next quarter would only decrease by  while annualized contract value would decrease by million 
in calculating annualized contract value  onesource factors only those contracts for which the customer has actually been invoiced 
since amounts invoiced are included in deferred revenues on onesource s balance sheet for all customer contracts with terms extending beyond the month of invoice  this demonstrates that annualized contract value is based on actual customer contracts reflected in onesource s historical financial statements 
to compute annualized contract value  one multiplies by twelve the amount of total invoiced fees for one month that are included in deferred revenues 
annualized contract value is not intended to be an absolute indicator of future revenues 
onesource only annualizes existing  invoiced contracts  but does so without regard to the remaining term of those contracts 
most of onesource s contracts are for months  but as of the date that onesource calculates annualized contract value  the remaining term of nearly all of onesource s contracts will be less than months 
if a customer fails to pay its invoiced fees or terminates the contract or if onesource is unable to renew a contract  its revenues in subsequent periods may be less than expected if based solely on annualized contract value 
conversely  if onesource adds additional customers or 
table of contents renews existing contracts at higher rates  its revenues in future periods may exceed expectations if based solely on annualized contract value 
the calculation of annualized contract value for onesource s web based products is illustrated below one month of web based invoiced fees deferred in deferred annualized measurement date revenues revenues contract value in thousands december  december  the aggregate annualized contract value for web based products was million as of december  and december  of this million  million was attributable to those customers that were under contract as of both december  and the renewal rate for subscribers of the business browser product line as of december  was calculated on a dollar basis  whereas the renewal rate for those subscribers that also used the applink software development kit as of december  was calculated on a dollar basis 
the number of web based customers decreased to at december  from at december  on average  onesource s customers for web based products as of december  had an annualized contract value of  per customer  compared to an average annualized contract value of  per customer as of december  onesource believes this growth in average annualized contract value was attributable to an increase in the number of user licenses purchased by individual customers and the addition of new products subscribed to by individual customers 
as of december   organizations subscribed to the applink software development kit 
such customers as of december  generated  on average  approximately  each in annualized contract value 
liquidity and capital resources since acquiring the business from lotus development corporation in  onesource has funded operations through a combination of seller financing  proceeds received from the sale of class p common stock and common stock in connection with the purchase of the business from lotus development corporation  bank debt  proceeds received from the sale of non strategic lines of business  capitalized equipment leases  cash flows from operations  our initial public offering which closed in may  and issuance of stock pursuant to stock options and employee stock purchase plan 
in addition  during december  onesource entered into a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank for borrowings up to million 
the loan and security agreement is for one year from the date of the signing and represents a working capital revolving line of credit and an equipment line of credit for up to million each 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december   compared to million at december  the increase was primarily due to funds provided by operating activities of million  partially offset by net cash used in investing activities of million and in financing activities of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the net increase of million period to period was the result of a net increase in assets and liabilities of million and an increase of million due to an increase of tax benefit associated with the disposition of stock options  partially offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization of million  and net income of million in compared to net income of million in net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to purchases of property and equipment for million during the year ended december  and million during the year ended december   as well as million for capitalized software 
table of contents development costs for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of the repurchase of common stock of million during the year ended december  and million during the year ended december   offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of stock pursuant to stock options and employee stock purchase plan of million during the year ended december  and million during the year ended december  onesource believes that its current cash and cash equivalents and funds anticipated to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the following twelve months 
however  in the event of a strategic cash requirement  onesource has entered into a revolving loan agreement during december with silicon valley bank for up to million

the following is a summary of provisions of onesource s agreements that onesource has determined are within the scope of fin onesource s agreements with onesource product customers  third party information and technology providers  and vendors include standard indemnification provisions 
under these agreements  onesource generally agrees to defend  indemnify  and hold harmless the indemnified party with respect to any third party claim that the onesource product  excluding any data or technology provided by the indemnified party  infringes a united states or united kingdom patent  copyright  trade secret  or other proprietary right 
the terms of these indemnification provisions are generally perpetual after execution of the agreement 
the maximum potential amount of future payments onesource may be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited 
onesource has never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle actions related to these indemnification provisions 
as a result  onesource believes that the estimated fair market value of these indemnification provisions is minimal 
accordingly  onesource does not have any liabilities recorded in its financial statements related to these provisions as of december  onesource s agreements with onesource product customers also include standard warranty provisions 
onesource warrants that it has the right to license the onesource product line to customers  but does not warrant the accuracy  adequacy  completeness  or timeliness of business browser content or the onesource product 
if necessary  onesource would provide for the estimated cost of product warranties based on specific warranty claims and claim history 
however  onesource has never incurred expense under its product warranties 
as a result  onesource believes that the estimated fair market value of this warranty provision is minimal 
accordingly  onesource does not have any liabilities recorded in its financial statements as related to this provision as of december  in november  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on emerging issues task force issue eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue addresses revenue recognition on arrangements encompassing multiple elements that are delivered at different points in time  defining criteria that must be met for elements to be considered to be a separate unit of 
table of contents accounting 
if an element is determined to be a separate unit of accounting  the revenue for the element is recognized at the time of delivery 
onesource does not expect that the adoption of eitf issue will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 
 which becomes effective for interim and fiscal periods ending after december  sfas no 
amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
onesource does not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a significant impact on its financial position and results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin addresses how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
the requirements of fin apply to all variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  onesource does not expect that the adoption of fin will have a significant impact on its financial position and results of operations 
certain factors that may affect future results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
onesource s actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including without limitation  those set forth in the following risk factors discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating onesource and its business we have a cumulative deficit and expect to continue to have a cumulative deficit for the foreseeable future  and we may not sustain or increase net income unless we continue to offset our royalty payments and operating expenses with revenues from our web based products and services 
we incurred losses from operations of approximately million in  million in  million in  million in  and million in  and had income from operations of million in and million in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
if we are unable to offset our royalty payments and operating expenses with revenues from our web based products and services  we may not be able to sustain or increase net income 
we rely on generating subscription revenues from our web based product line  and we may not sustain or increase net income unless demand for our web based products remains the same or continues to grow 
subscription revenues from our web based product line accounted for of total revenues in  of total revenues in  of total revenues in  of total revenues in  of total revenues in  and of total revenues in as a result  our future financial condition may depend heavily on the success or failure of our web based product line  including the ease of integration of information from these products with customer internal applications 
these products were introduced in december  and it is difficult to predict demand and market acceptance in the rapidly evolving web based business information products and services market 
if the demand for our web based products does not remain the same or continue to grow  whether due to  among other factors  increased competition  lack of 
table of contents market acceptance  insufficient enhancements  failure of internet or web use to grow in general  or technological change  we may not be able to sustain or increase net income 
our sales efforts to our target market may be lengthy  involve delays  or involve uncertainty  all of which may adversely impact our business  operating results  and financial condition 
selling our products and services to global companies  our target market  involves sales cycles that we believe are potentially longer and more uncertain than those involving small size organizations 
our customers generally commit significant time and resources to evaluate our products and services  and they often require us to expend substantial time  effort  and money to educate them about our products and services 
in addition  these sales efforts often require final approval from our customers senior level management  potentially resulting in delays to the sales cycle 
any of these factors may extend the sales cycle and increase the uncertainty of whether a sale will actually be completed 
the timing and uncertainty of sales and the length of the sales cycle may cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and may have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
annualized contract value may not be an accurate indicator of our performance 
we use annualized contract value as a measurement for normalized period to period comparisons to indicate business volume and growth 
our presentation and calculation of annualized contract value may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
it is not an absolute indicator  and we cannot guarantee that any annualized contract value will be ultimately realized as revenues 
competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have greater resources than we do  this competition may adversely affect our financial results 
the business information products and services industry is intensely competitive 
several of our information providers compete against each other and in some cases with us 
we face direct or indirect competition from numerous companies including the following large  well established business and financial information providers such as dow jones co  pearson plc  reuters group plc  and mcgraw hill companies inc  aggregators of business and financial information  such as lexisnexis group a reed elsevier plc subsidiary  the dialog corporation a thomson corporation subsidiary  factiva a dow jones co 
subsidiary  and bureau van dijk computer services sa  providers of company information  such as thomson financial  inc a thomson corporation subsidiary  market guide inc a multex 
com  inc 
subsidiary  hemscott group ltd  and hoovers  inc a subsidiary of the dun bradstreet corporation  providers of sales  marketing  and credit information such as dun bradstreet  inc a subsidiary of the dun bradstreet corporation and infousa inc  and web retrieval  web portal companies  and other free or low cost mass market on line services  such as yahoo inc  aol time warner  inc  marketwatch 
com  inc  and thestreet 
com  inc 
based on reported operating results  industry reports and other publicly available information  we believe that many of our existing competitors  as well as a number of prospective competitors  have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases  and significantly greater financial  technical  and marketing resources than we possess 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in user requirements  or to devote greater resources to the research  development  promotion  and sale of their products and services than we can 
these competitors may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies  and make more attractive offers to potential employees  customers  and information providers 
our competitors also may develop products and services that are equal or superior to our products or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services 
ultimately  we may lose customers to competitors if we are not able to satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements  improve existing onesource products and services  and develop new products and services in a timely  economical fashion 
in addition  increased 
table of contents competition may result in price reductions  reduced margins  or loss of market share  any of which may materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
our failure to increase the number of our subscribers or retain our current subscriber base may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
our future success remains highly dependent on attracting organizations that are financially able to and willing to allocate funds to subscribe to on line business information products and services 
if the market for subscription based on line business information products and services develops more slowly than we may anticipate  or if our efforts to retain existing subscribers or attract new subscribers are not successful or cost effective  our operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
if a significant number of our customers experience a decline in their financial condition  the collectability of our accounts receivable may suffer  and may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
a decline in the financial condition of additional customers owing significant amounts to us may cause us to write off the amounts owed by these customers as bad debt  and or a revenue reduction  either of which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
expanding into international markets where we have limited prior experience may materially and adversely affect our business 
we presently have offices located primarily in the united states and in the united kingdom  but look to expand our business opportunities into new markets 
expanding into diverse international markets exposes us to certain risks of conducting business that include  but are not limited to  the following potential higher costs  unanticipated regulatory changes  political instability  difficulties in staffing and managing operations  adverse tax consequences  currency and exchange rate fluctuations  and seasonal reductions in business activity 
in addition  the impact of language and other cultural differences may result in product and service offerings that may not satisfy the needs of our customers and may not be profitable 
further  strategic relationships may be necessary to facilitate expansion into certain markets  and our business may be adversely affected if we misallocate our resources and ultimately fail to gain new or effective alliances in these areas 
moreover  possible nationalization  expropriation  and limits and unique laws pertaining to the collection and provision of certain types of information on individuals eg  the data protection act may hinder operations in international markets  and may materially and adversely affect our business 
general economic and geopolitical conditions may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 
an ongoing economic downturn and uncertain geopolitical environment may cause organizations to delay or forego entirely investments in value added business information products and services such as our web based products and services 
we have experienced these effects in the last year as a result of the recent economic slowdown and geopolitical conditions 
a prolonged recession and geopolitical crisis may cause organizations that comprise our target market to significantly reduce discretionary spending with business information providers and create a greater risk of business failure among existing subscribers 
these effects may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
if our information providers provide us with inaccurate or unreliable data  fail to transmit their data feeds in a timely manner  cease doing business with us  or require us to significantly increase our royalty obligations  future sales of our web based products and services may be jeopardized  and this may materially and adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we depend significantly on information providers to supply accurate and reliable information and data feeds to us on a timely basis 
our web based products and services may experience interruptions and potentially may be compromised due to any failure  delay  or cut off in the transmission or receipt of this information  or a requirement by our information providers that royalty payments be significantly increased 
in addition  our products and services may be negatively affected if our information providers provide us with faulty or erroneous data that becomes 
table of contents integrated with our products and services 
we may then have to seek alternatives to the information providers information and data feeds  and  in some cases  it is possible that reasonable alternatives may not exist without resorting to multiple sources  or may not be provided in a timely manner 
this may result in increased costs or reduced functionality of our products and services and may materially and adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
if our third party hosting facility suffered a disaster  it may be costly to correct  and our business may suffer significant losses 
our third party hosting facility may suffer a disaster relating to the facility  its power supplies  or telecommunications transports 
defects  errors  or a disaster at our third party hosting facility also may result in significant downtime  and our business may as a consequence suffer significantly from potential adverse customer reaction  litigation  negative publicity  loss of revenues  or harm to our reputation 
if our software or hardware becomes defective  or if our software  hardware  or web site becomes the target of intentional disruptions  directly or indirectly  our products and services may be negatively impacted  and our reputation  future sales  operating results  and financial condition may be harmed if these efforts are successful 
complex software like the software we develop and use and the hardware we use for our products and services may contain or develop errors or defects  especially when first implemented and as our product and service offerings increase in scope and complexity  that may be difficult and costly to correct 
in addition  our software  hardware  or web site may become the target of intentional disruptions  directly or indirectly  including software viruses and malicious code specifically designed to impede the performance of our products and services  such software viruses and malicious code may avoid detection by our anti virus software in place 
similarly  experienced computer programmers or hackers may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our web site and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions to the delivery of our products and services 
as a result  our activities may be substantially disrupted  the introduction of new products  services  and enhancements may be delayed  and our reputation  future sales  operating results  and financial condition may be adversely affected if these efforts are successful 
potential growth in our future operations may strain our managerial and financial resources and operating systems 
failure to successfully manage growth  or unexpected difficulties during expansion  may materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we have experienced growth in our operations and plan to pursue growth opportunities as relate to business browser product line  related software applications  and fee based services  particularly in our target market accounts 
in order to support such potential growth  we may need to i implement and modify relevant financial  operational  and management controls  reporting systems  and procedures on a timely basis  ii expand  train  and manage our employee base  and iii alter the coordination among our staff responsible for product and platform development  sales and marketing  and finance and administration 
if we are unable to accomplish any of these objectives during a period of growth  our operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted 
we may have difficulty identifying and competing for acquisition opportunities  and the time  energy  and resources dedicated to these acquisition opportunities may materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
our business strategy includes the pursuit of strategic acquisitions 
from time to time we may engage in discussions with third parties concerning potential acquisitions of niche expertise  business  and or proprietary rights 
in executing our acquisition strategy  we may be unable to identify suitable companies as acquisition candidates 
in addition  if we pursue an acquisition and are unable to identify a suitable acquisition candidate  management may potentially spend a significant amount of time  energy  and resources that may materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

table of contents pursuing and completing any potential acquisition s may divert management attention and financial resources and may not produce the desired business results 
if we pursue and complete any potential acquisition s  our management team may spend a significant amount of time and management and financial resources in the acquisition process and to integrate the acquired business with our existing business 
to pay for acquisition s  we may use capital stock  cash  or a combination of both 
alternatively  we may borrow money from a bank or other lender 
if we use cash or debt financing  our financial liquidity will be reduced 
in addition  from an accounting perspective  the potential acquisition s may involve nonrecurring charges or involve amortization of significant amounts of goodwill that may materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
despite the investment of these management and financial resources and completion of due diligence with respect to these efforts  the potential acquisition s may not produce the revenues  earnings  or business synergies that we may anticipate  and the acquired technology or proprietary right s may not perform as expected for a variety of reasons  including the following difficulty in the integration of the operations  technologies  rights  products  services  and personnel of the acquired business es  difficulty in maintaining controls  procedures  and policies during the transition and integration  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  inability to maintain the key business relationships and the reputations of acquired business es  potential dilution to current stockholders from the issuance of additional equity securities  failure through the due diligence process to identify significant issues with product and service quality  product architecture  legal and financial contingencies  and product and service development  among other things  expenses of any undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the acquired business es  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired business es 
we may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly results  which may make it difficult for investors to perform reliable period to period comparisons  and contribute to volatility in the market price for our common stock  thus potentially reducing investment in our stock 
our quarterly revenues  gross profits  and operating results may fluctuate in the future 
in addition  we believe that an important measure of our business is the annualized contract value at the end of each period  which also may fluctuate 
causes of such fluctuations have included and may include  among other factors  as follows changes in demand for our products and services  the size  value and timing of both new and renewal subscriptions with our corporate customers  the cost and renewal status of contracts with our content providers  competition particularly price  product  and service competition  increases in selling and marketing expense  as well as other operating expenses  technical difficulties or system downtime affecting our products or the web generally  overall performance of our products  services  and technology  our ability to develop  market  and introduce new and enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis  
table of contents economic conditions specific to the web  as well as general economic and political conditions  and consolidation of our customers 
further  a substantial portion of our expenses  including most product and platform development and selling and marketing expenses  must be incurred in advance of revenue generation 
if we are unable to expand our sales and marketing efforts and our projected revenues do not meet our expectations  then we are likely to experience a shortfall in our income from operations relative to our expectations 
moreover  although we are not presently a party to a lawsuit  any potential claims  even if not meritorious  against us may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources on our part  which may contribute to a decrease in investment of our stock and may materially impact our operating results and financial condition by potentially subjecting us to significant liabilities and negative publicity and by diverting management s attention and resources 
we may be subject to potential litigation by any third party concerning the infringement of any proprietary right  and such litigation may be costly and time consuming 
in addition  we may have to incur legal expenses to protect our intellectual property rights 
there has been substantial litigation in the information services industry involving intellectual property rights 
although we believe that we have not infringed  and are not infringing  the intellectual property of others through our products and services  if such claims were to be asserted  with or without merit  they may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
in addition  to the extent that we license from third parties informational content that is included in our business browser product line  our potential exposure to copyright infringement actions may increase because we must rely upon warranties and representations by such information providers as to the origin and ownership of content that we are subsequently licensing to users of our business browser products  such warranties and representations that may be inaccurate or inadequate 
in addition  although we generally obtain indemnification provisions in our agreements with information providers  indemnification may not be adequate compensation for breach of such warranties and representations 
in the event of a successful claim against us  we may be required to pay significant monetary damages if we are held to have willfully infringed a patent  copyright  trade secret  or other proprietary right  discontinue use or sale of the infringing products or information  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  and or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that may not be offered on acceptable terms 
if a successful claim is filed against us and we fail to commercially develop or license a substitute technology  our business may be materially harmed 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to defend  enforce  and or protect our own intellectual property  including our copyrights  patents  trademarks  and other proprietary information 
the protective steps we have taken and continue to take may be inadequate to deter misappropriations of our intellectual property rights  and we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of  or take appropriate steps to enforce  our intellectual property rights 
any litigation involving intellectual property rights may be costly and time consuming  and divert management s attention  either of which may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
adverse determinations in this litigation may result in the loss of our proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from additional third parties  cause our customers to prematurely cancel their subscriptions to our products  and prevent us from selling our products  any one of these results may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
additionally  our general liability insurance may not cover any of these claims or may not be adequate to protect us against all liability that may be imposed 
further  effective protection of intellectual property rights is limited or unavailable in certain foreign countries  thus making the possibility of misappropriation of our intellectual property more likely 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  expensive  and time consuming  and the unique technology of the internet may provide new methods for illegal copying and distribution 
accordingly  we cannot be certain that we may be able to protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized third party copying  distribution  or use 
this may subject us to litigation and materially and adversely affect our competitive position 

table of contents if we lose key personnel and are unable to attract additional and retain existing key personnel  it may cause a material and adverse effect on our business 
we expect that our future success will depend  in substantial part  on the continued services of our senior management  including daniel j 
schimmel  our president and chief executive officer  william g 
schumacher  our senior vice president  content development  philip j 
garlick  our senior vice president  global sales  service  and marketing  roy d 
landon  our senior vice president and chief financial officer  patti purcell  our senior vice president  products and solutions  and david j 
desimone  our chief information technology officer 
none of our senior management has entered into employment agreements with us  and we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees 
the loss of the services of one or a group of our key personnel may have a material  adverse effect on development of new products and services  our ability to manage the business  and our financial condition 
in addition  we expect that our future success will depend on our continuing ability to attract  retain  and motivate highly qualified technical  customer support  sales  financial  accounting  and managerial personnel 
competition for such key personnel is intense  and we cannot assure that we will be able to retain such personnel or that we will be able to attract  assimilate  or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 
moreover  competition for highly qualified key personnel may lead to increased recruitment and retention costs  thus potentially hindering our financial condition 
the future sales of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price  which may cause difficulties in the future to sell equity 
if our stockholders decide to sell substantial amounts of our common stock  including shares that may be issued upon the exercise of outstanding options in the public market  the market price of our common stock may decrease 
such potential sales may make it increasingly difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable and appropriate 
if we are unable to maintain our reputation and expand our name recognition  we may have difficulty attracting new business and retaining our current customer base and employees  and our brand name  reputation  and business may suffer 
establishing and maintaining a solid reputation and name recognition are critical for attracting and retaining customers as well as employees 
the importance of reputation and name recognition is increasing and will continue to increase due to the growing number and quality of providers of web based business and financial information products and services 
if our reputation is damaged or if potential customers and employees are not familiar with our products and services  we may not be able to attract new  or retain existing  customers and employees 
the promotion and enhancement of our name will depend largely on our success in continuing to provide valuable products and services and to successfully market our products and services 
if customers do not perceive our products and services to be effective or high quality  our brand name  reputation  and business may suffer 
laws  rules  and regulations with respect to corporate governance  reporting  and disclosure may hinder our ability to attract and or retain capable board members  a chief executive officer  and a chief financial officer  and may result in a reduction in the number of board members  which may materially and adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition and our ability to meet listing criteria 
in july  president george w 
bush signed the sarbanes oxley act of into law  and several new rules and regulations were announced thereafter 
among other things  the sarbanes oxley act of imposes new corporate governance  reporting  and disclosure requirements  introduces stricter independence and financial expertise standards for audit committees  and imposes stiff penalties for securities fraud 
in addition  the united states securities and exchange commission and the nasdaq national market are considering proposals on related corporate governance topics 
the sarbanes oxley act of and the related rules and regulations will likely increase the scope  complexity and costs of our corporate governance  reporting  and disclosure practices  and may increase the risk of personal liability for our board members  chief executive officer  and chief financial officer 
consequently  it may become more difficult to attract and or retain such individuals  and may result in a decrease in the number of board members  which may materially 
table of contents and adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition and our ability to meet listing criteria 
if the internet becomes subject to increased legislation and government regulation  use of the internet as a medium to receive subscription based information products and services may decline  and we may be subject to litigation  either of which may have a material and adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
the laws governing the internet continue to be unsettled  even in areas where there has been legislative action 
legislation may dampen the growth in the use of the internet generally and decrease the acceptance of the internet as a medium to receive subscription based information products and services 
in addition  due to the global nature of the internet  it is possible that  although our corporate headquarters are located in the commonwealth of massachusetts and pre production and development relating to our products and services occurs primarily in the commonwealth of massachusetts  other states  the united states  or foreign countries may attempt to regulate our products and services or levy sales or other applicable taxes on our web based products and services 
we cannot guarantee that violations of federal  state  local  or other laws will not be alleged by governmental entities  that we may not unintentionally violate these laws  or that these laws will not be modified  or new laws enacted  in the future 
any of these developments may have a material and adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
if requirements related to accounting treatment for employee stock options are modified  we may be forced to change our business practices  which may hinder our ability to retain existing employees and attract highly qualified candidates  which may have a negative effect on our earnings 
we currently account for the issuance of stock options under accounting principles board opinion no 
apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
if proposals currently under consideration by accounting standards organizations and governmental authorities are adopted  we may be required to treat the value of stock options granted to employees as a compensation expense 
as a result  we may decide to reduce the number of stock options granted to employees or to grant options to fewer employees 
this may affect our ability to retain existing employees and attract highly qualified candidates  and increase the cash compensation we may be required to pay these individuals 
such a change may have a negative effect on our earnings 
some of our stockholders may be able to significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval  which may delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer  or proxy contest  and may adversely affect the rights of our stockholders 
our current directors  officers  and greater than stockholders together beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding shares of common stock 
while these stockholders do not hold a majority of our outstanding common stock  they will be able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval  which may delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer  or proxy contest  and may adversely affect the rights of our stockholders that may otherwise receive a premium over the fair market value of our common stock 
provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by laws contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing certain corporate actions  which may adversely affect the rights of our stockholders 
our board of directors is authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges  and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without further approval by stockholders 
preferred stock may be issued with voting  liquidation  dividend  and other rights superior to those of common stock  without stockholder approval 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or may discourage a third party from acquiring  a majority of our outstanding common stock 
this may delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer  or 
table of contents proxy contest and may adversely affect the rights of our stockholders that may otherwise receive a premium over the fair market value of our common stock 
as we complement the business browser product line with new products and services  this may divert management and technical attention and financial resources and may not produce the desired business results 
as we complement the business browser product line with new business information products and services  our management team and technical personnel may spend a significant amount of time and management and financial resources in such development and implementation 
despite the investment of these management and financial resources with respect to these efforts  the potential new products and services may not produce the revenues  earnings  or business results that we may anticipate for the following reasons we may experience difficulty in developing and implementing products and services that integrate and operate effectively with our customers existing applications  business processes  and functions  the market may not adopt these products and services as readily as we envision  we may contract with certain third parties to provide content and or supplement the products and services we provide  which may yield lower gross margins than our existing business  we may experience delays in the development and implementation of these products and services  and the introduction of new services may require changes to accounting methods  policies and procedures 
any one or more of these factors may affect our business  operating results  and financial condition  and this makes the prediction of operating results on a quarterly basis unreliable 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical operating results and annualized contract values are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication for future performance 
also  due to these and other factors  it is possible that our quarterly operating results including the annualized contract value may be below expectations 
if this happens  the price of our common stock would likely decrease 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk onesource is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations has been and is expected to continue to be modest due to the fact that the operations of our united kingdom subsidiary are almost exclusively conducted in local currency  rather than multiple foreign currencies 
operating results are translated into united states dollars and consolidated for reporting purposes 
the impact of currency exchange rate movements on intercompany transactions was immaterial for the years ended december   and onesource does not engage in hedging activities 
onesource also owns money market funds that are sensitive to market risks as part of its investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve onesource s capital until it is required to fund operations  including onesource s sales and marketing and product development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
the investment portfolio contains instruments that are subject to the risk of a decline in interest rates 
onesource does not enter into derivatives or any other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
onesource has no long term debt obligations 
as of december   onesource had million in cash and cash equivalents
