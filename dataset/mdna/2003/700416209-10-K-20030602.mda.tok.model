item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general park is a leading global designer and producer of advanced electronic materials used to fabricate complex multilayer printed circuit boards and other electronic interconnect systems 
the company s customers include leading independent printed circuit board fabricators  electronic manufacturing service companies  electronic contract manufacturers and major electronic original equipment manufacturers in the computer  telecommunications  transportation  aerospace and instrumentation industries 
the severe correction and downturn that occurred in the global electronics industry early in the fiscal year ended march  and that dramatically affected the company s financial performance during that fiscal year  with steep declines in sales by the company s north american  european and asian operations  persisted during the fiscal year ended march  and caused the global electronics industry to be very depressed throughout the fiscal year  with no clear signs of recovery 
consequently  the company s sales declined during the fiscal year  although not as steeply as in the prior fiscal year  with decreased sales of electronic materials in north america and europe 
while the company s operations continued to be weak during the fiscal year as almost all markets for sophisticated printed circuit materials continued to experience severely depressed conditions  the company s gross profit in the fiscal year was significantly more than its gross profit in the fiscal year as a result of the company s reductions of its costs and expenses and higher percentages of sales of higher technology  higher margin products 
in addition to its depressed financial results of operations  during the fiscal year the company recorded pre tax charges totaling million related to the closure of its nelco uk manufacturing facility and workforce reductions at a north american business unit and the writedowns of fixed assets at its continuing operations in north america and germany resulting from the realignment of its north american fr business operations in new york and california and the closure of the mass lamination operation in germany 
these charges were only slightly offset by the pre tax gain of million realized by the company during the fiscal year second quarter in connection with the sale of its dielectric polymers  inc dpi subsidiary for million cash 
the company recorded a pre tax charge of million in its fiscal year third quarter for the cost of closing its nelco uk manufacturing facility located in skelmersdale  england  which it announced in october in response to the almost complete collapse of the uk high technology circuit board industry 
for many years  nelco uk was one of the most vital parts of the company s global high technology circuit materials business  but the uk high technology circuit board industry had been devastated  and the closure of the nelco uk facility was unavoidable  as there was not enough business available in the entire uk market to justify the company s having an operation in the uk in the future 
the company is supplying its few remaining customers in the uk with product produced at its nelco facility located in mirebeau  france and will continue to provide these uk customers with local account management  technical service and materials and inventory support 
in addition  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million during the fiscal year third quarter for severance payments for workforce reductions at a north american business unit 
in its fiscal year first quarter  the company announced that dielektra gmbh  the company s advanced electronic materials business located in cologne  germany  was closing its mass lamination operation 
dielektra s mass lamination operation supplied higher end mass lamination products to european circuit board manufacturers 
however  the market for these products in europe had eroded to the point where the company no longer believed it was possible to operate a viable mass lamination business in europe  and the company did not believe that  at any time in the foreseeable future  the higher end european mass lamination market would recover to the extent necessary to justify the company s operating a mass lamination business in europe 
after the closure of dielektra s mass lamination operation  its manufacturing operations will consist exclusively of high technology treating and dielektra s proprietary datlamt automated continuous laminate manufacturing  and the dielektra business will be focused exclusively on its unique high technology manufacturing processes and product line 
the company is developing new and more advanced products to be manufactured by dielektra on its datlamt automated continuous manufacturing lines 
the company believes that dielektra s datlam products have certain unique technological capabilities which are useful to high technology circuit board customers which produce complex high density circuit boards 
in the fiscal year first quarter  the company also announced the realignment of its north american fr business operations located in new york and california and the establishment of a new business unit called nelco north america  which will include the company s fr manufacturing operations in new york and california and will be administered principally from fullerton  california 
as part of the realignment  the new york operation will be scaled down to a smaller focused operation and the california operation will be significantly scaled up to a larger volume operation  and there will be significant workforce reductions at the company s new york facility and significant workforce increases at the company s california facility 
after the new york operations have been scaled back  a large portion of the new york facility will be mothballed 
the company will have the flexibility in the future to scale back up the newburgh  new york facility if the opportunity to do so presents itself 
the realignment is designed to help the company achieve improved operating and cost efficiencies in its north american fr business and to help the company better service all of the its existing north american customers 
the company does not contemplate losing any north american customers as a result of the realignment 
the company believes it has recently gained market share with two of its major customers in north america 
as a result of continuing declines in the company s north american business operations and dielektra s mass lamination operation  during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year the company reassessed the recoverability of the fixed assets of those operations based on cash flow projections and determined that such fixed assets were impaired  and the company recorded pre tax impairment charges of million in the company s fiscal year fourth quarter to reduce the book values of such fixed assets to their estimated fair values 
in the fiscal year first quarter  the company decided to realign its north american fr business operations located in newburgh  new york and fullerton  california and to close dielektra s mass lamination operation  and the company expects to record additional pre tax charges totaling approximately million in the first half of the company s fiscal year as a result of the north american realignment and the closure of dielektra s mass lamination operation and related workforce reductions 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information regarding the realignment and closure 
during the company s fiscal year and for several years prior thereto  more than of the company s total worldwide sales were to delco electronics corporation  a subsidiary of general motors corp  and the company s wholly owned subsidiary  nelco technology  inc nti located in tempe  arizona  had been delco s principal supplier of semi finished multilayer printed circuit board materials  commonly known as mass lamination  which were used by delco to produce finished multilayer printed circuit boards 
however  in march  the company was informed by delco that delco planned to close its printed circuit board fabrication plant and exit the printed circuit board manufacturing business 
as a result  the company s sales to delco declined during the three month period ended may   were negligible during the remainder of the fiscal year and have been nil since that time 
in may  the company and nti filed a complaint against delco electronics corporation and the delphi automotive systems unit of general motors corp 
in the united states district court for the district of arizona 
the complaint alleged  among other things  that delco breached its contract to purchase semi finished multilayer printed circuit boards from nti and that delphi interfered with nti s contract with delco  that delco breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the contract  that delco engaged in negligent misrepresentation and that delco fraudulently induced nti to enter into the contract 
the company and nti sought substantial compensatory and punitive damages 
in november  a jury awarded damages to nti in the amount of million  and in december the judge in the united states district court for the district of arizona entered judgment for nti on its claim of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing with damages in the amount of million 
both parties appealed the decision to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit in san francisco  and on may   a panel of three judges in the court of appeals for the ninth circuit rendered a unanimous decision affirming the jury verdict 
the time period within which delco could have filed a petition for rehearing by the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit has expired 
as of may   neither the company nor nti has received notice that delco has filed a petition for rehearing

the company believes that an evaluation of its ongoing operations would be difficult if the disclosure of its financial results were limited to generally accepted accounting principles gaap financial measures 
accordingly  in addition to disclosing its financial results determined in accordance with gaap  the company discloses non gaap operating results that exclude certain items in order to assist its shareholders and other readers in assessing the company s operating performance 
such non gaap financial measures are provided to supplement the results provided in accordance with gaap 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year the company s operations continued to be weak during the fiscal year ended march  as the north american  european and  to a lesser extent  asian markets for sophisticated printed circuit materials continued to experience severely depressed conditions during the fiscal year 
nevertheless  the company s gross profit in the fiscal year ended march  was significantly more than the gross profit in the fiscal year ended march  as a result of the company s reductions of its costs and expenses and higher percentages of sales of higher technology  higher margin products 
in addition to its depressed financial results of operations  the company recorded pre tax  fixed asset impairment charges of million in the fiscal year fourth quarter related to the writedowns of fixed assets at its continuing operations in north america and germany 
the company also recorded pre tax charges of million in the fiscal year third quarter in connection with the closure of its nelco uk manufacturing facility in skelmersdale  england and severance costs at a north american business unit and realized a pre tax gain of million in the fiscal year second quarter in connection with the sale of its dpi subsidiary 
in the fiscal year  the company recorded pre tax charges totaling million related to the realignment of the operations of dielektra gmbh  the sale of the assets and business of nti  the company s wholly owned subsidiary that manufactured semi finished printed circuit boards  commonly known as mass lamination  in tempe  arizona  the closure of a related support facility in arizona and severance payments for workforce reductions at the company s continuing operations 
the continuing low levels of sales of electronic materials wwew largely responsible for the company s results of operations for the fiscal year ended march  the north american and european markets for sophisticated printed circuits continued to be severely depressed during the fiscal year  and the company s electronic materials operations located in those regions suffered as a result  although the company believes it gained market share with certain of its electronic materials customers 
the company s results of operations and margins improved in the fiscal year principally as a result of the electronic material business reductions in costs and expenses despite the decrease in sales and the concomitant operation of the company s facilities at levels far below their designed manufacturing capacities 
operating results of the company s advanced composite materials business also improved during the fiscal year primarily as a result of higher percentages of sales of higher margin products 
results of operations net sales for the fiscal year ended march  declined to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in net sales was principally the result of lower unit volumes of materials shipped by the company s operations in europe and north america  partially offset by higher unit volumes of materials shipped by the company s operations in asia 
the comparative decrease in net sales was also influenced by the fact that the company s net sales in the fiscal year ended march  benefited from significantly higher sales in march than in any subsequent month  as the downturn in the global electronics industry and in the company s sales occurred in the fiscal year first quarter 
the company s foreign operations accounted for million of sales  or of the company s total sales worldwide  during the fiscal year  compared with million of sales  or of total sales worldwide  during the fiscal year and of total sales worldwide during the fiscal year 
sales by the company s foreign operations during the fiscal year increased slightly from the fiscal year due to increases in sales in asia while sales by the company s operations in england and germany declined during the fiscal year compared with the prior fiscal year 
the overall gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the company s worldwide operations improved to during the fiscal year compared with during the fiscal year 
the improvement in the gross margin was attributable to the significant declines in costs and expenses from the fiscal year  production efficiencies resulting from enhanced manufacturing automation  and increases in market share with certain key electronic materials customers  which were only partially offset by lower sales volumes and inefficiencies caused by operating certain facilities at levels below their designed manufacturing capacities 
gross profit was also positively impacted by higher percentages of sales of higher technology  higher margin products  as high performance materials accounted for of worldwide sales for the fiscal year compared with for the prior fiscal year 
the company s cost of sales decreased significantly as a result of lower production volumes and cost reduction measures implemented by the company  including significant workforce reductions and the reduction of overtime  and the company continued to implement an annual salary freeze for significant numbers of salaried employees  especially senior management employees  and paid no performance bonuses or significantly reduced bonuses and other incentives 
selling  general and administrative expenses declined by million  or by  during the fiscal year compared with the fiscal year  and these expenses  measured as a percentage of sales  were during the fiscal year compared with during the fiscal year 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in the fiscal year was due to workforce reductions resulting from the sale of dpi and the closure of the company s uk manufacturing facility in skelmersdale  england and expense reduction measures implemented by the company during the fiscal year 
in the fiscal year fourth quarter  the company recorded pre tax  fixed asset impairment charges of million related to the writedowns of fixed assets at continuing operations in north america and germany  which the company announced in its fiscal year first quarter 
the after tax impact of these fixed asset impairments was million 
in addition  the company recorded pre tax charges totaling million in the fiscal year third quarter related to the closure of its nelco uk manufacturing facility and severance costs at a north american business unit and a pre tax gain of million in the fiscal year second quarter in connection with the sale of dpi on june  for million in cash 
the net pre tax charge for all these items for the fiscal year was million  and the net after tax charge for the fiscal year was million 
for the reasons set forth above  loss from operations was million for the fiscal year  including the pre tax charges described above related to the writedowns of fixed assets at continuing operations in north america and germany  the closure of the nelco uk manufacturing facility and severance costs at a north american business unit and the pre tax gain described above related to the sale of dpi  compared with a loss from operations of million for the fiscal year  including the pre tax charges described above related to the realignment of the operations of the company s german business unit  a workforce reduction at another business unit  the sale of nti  the closure of a related support facility and severance for the lay off of employees at the company s continuing operations 
the loss from operations for the fiscal year  before the pre tax items described above  was million  compared with a loss from operations of million before the pre tax charges described above for the fiscal year 
interest and other income  net  principally investment income  declined to million for the fiscal year from million for the fiscal year 
the decrease in investment income was attributable to lower prevailing interest rates during the fiscal year 
the company s investments were primarily short term taxable instruments 
the company incurred no interest expense during the or fiscal years 
the company s interest expense in prior fiscal years was related to its million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due see liquidity and capital resources elsewhere in this item the company s effective income tax rate was for the fiscal year compared to for the fiscal year 
this decrease in the effective tax rate was the result of a valuation allowance on the tax benefit from losses sustained in the fiscal year that will be carried forward to future years for tax purposes 
the valuation allowance eliminated the current recognition of the tax benefit from the tax loss carryforward due to the uncertainty of the use of such benefit 
the net loss for the fiscal year  including the after tax charges of described above related to the writedowns of fixed assets at continuing operations in north america and germany  the closure of the nelco uk manufacturing facility and severance costs at a north american business unit  was million  compared to a net loss of million for the fiscal year  including the pre tax charges described above related to the realignment of the operations of the company s german business unit  a workforce reduction at another business unit  the sale of nti  the closure of a related support facility and severance for the lay off of employees at the company s continuing operations 
basic and diluted losses per share for the fiscal year were  including the pre tax charges and gain described above  compared to losses per share of including the pre tax charges described above  for the fiscal year 
basic and diluted losses per share  before the pre tax charges and gain described above  were for the fiscal year  compared to losses of for the fiscal year  before the pre tax charges described above 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year the company experienced a sharp decline in its results of operations for the fiscal year ended march  as the north american  european and asian markets for sophisticated printed circuit materials experienced severe downturns during such periods 
in addition to its severely depressed results of operations  during the fiscal year first quarter  the company incurred pre tax charges of million in connection with the sale of the assets and business of nti and the closure of a related support facility in arizona and million in connection with workforce reductions at the company s continuing operations 
after delco electronics corporation informed the company in march that delco planned to close its printed circuit board manufacturing business  the business of nti languished and its performance was unsatisfactory due primarily to the absence of the unique  high volume  high quality business that had been provided by delco electronics and the absence of any other customer in the north american electronic materials industry with a similar demand for the large volumes of semi finished multilayer printed circuit board materials that delco purchased from nti 
although nti s business experienced a resurgence in the fiscal year as the north american market for printed circuit materials became extremely strong and demand exceeded supply for the electronic materials manufactured by the company  the company s internal expectations and projections for the nti business were for continuing volatility in the business performance over the foreseeable future 
consequently  the company commenced efforts to sell the business in the second half of its fiscal year  and in april  the company sold the assets and business of nti and closed a related support facility  also located in tempe  arizona 
in connection with the sale and closure  the company recorded pre tax charges of million in its fiscal year first quarter ended may  as a result of this sale  the company exited the mass lamination business in north america 
although the company s electronic materials business was not dependent on this single customer  the loss of this customer had a material adverse effect on this business in the last three fiscal years 
the company also incurred pre tax charges during the fiscal year third quarter totaling million in connection with the realignment of the operations of its german subsidiary  dielektra gmbh  the company s electronic materials business located in cologne  germany 
the realignment included the closure of dielektra s conventional lamination line to enable it to better focus its efforts and capabilities on its unique datlamt automated continuous lamination and paneling manufacturing technology and the reduction of the size of its mass lamination operations in order to focus on the marketing and manufacturing of high technology  higher layer count mass lamination product 
the closure of dielektra s remaining mass lamination operations was subsequently announced by the company in the fiscal year first quarter 
the company incurred an additional  pre tax charge during the fiscal year third quarter for a workforce reduction at another business unit 
the significant reduction in the company s sales of electronic materials was largely responsible for the severe decline in the company s results of operations for the fiscal year ended march  the north american  european and asian markets for sophisticated printed circuit materials collapsed during the fiscal year  and the company s electronic materials operations located in each region suffered as a result  although the company believes it gained market share with certain of its electronic materials customers 
the company s results of operations and margins declined in the fiscal year principally as a result of the electronic material business decrease in sales of all products and the concomitant operation of the company s facilities at levels far below their designed manufacturing capacity 
operating results of the company s specialty adhesive tape business  which the company sold in the fiscal year second quarter  and advanced composite materials business also declined during the fiscal year 
this decline was attributable to lower volumes of products sold 
results of operations net sales for the fiscal year ended march  declined to million from million for the fiscal year ended february  this decline in sales was the result of lower unit volumes of materials shipped and the absence of sales by nti  which  as described above  the company sold in the fiscal year first quarter 
although the net sales of nti during the fiscal year were material relative to the company s consolidated net sales during such year  the operations of nti were not material to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  capital resources or liquidity  and the sale of nti is not expected to have any material effect on the company s future operating results  financial position  capital resources  liquidity or continuing operations 
the company s foreign operations accounted for million of sales  or of the company s total sales worldwide  during the fiscal year  compared with million of sales  or of total sales worldwide  during the fiscal year 
sales by the company s foreign operations during the fiscal year decreased from the fiscal year 
the decrease in sales by the company s foreign operations in the fiscal year was due to decreases in sales in both asia and europe 
the overall gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the company s worldwide operations was during the fiscal year compared with during the fiscal year 
the deterioration in the gross profit was attributable to the significant declines in sales volumes from the fiscal year and inefficiencies caused by operating certain facilities at levels below their designed manufacturing capacity  which was only slightly offset by increases in market share with certain key electronic materials customers and the growth in sales of higher technology  higher margin products as a percentage of total sales 
although the company s cost of sales decreased significantly as a result of lower production volumes and cost reduction measures implemented by the company  including significant workforce reductions  the reduction of overtime and the decision to not implement annual salary increases  the declines in sales and production volumes resulted in lower volumes to absorb fixed overhead costs and  consequently  an increase in the cost of sales as a percentage of net sales in the fiscal year 
although selling  general and administrative expenses declined by million  or by  during the fiscal year compared with the fiscal year  these expenses  measured as a percentage of sales  were during the fiscal year compared with during the fiscal year 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in the fiscal year resulted from lower sales compared to the fiscal year and the fixed components of such expenses 
for the reasons set forth above  for the fiscal year  profit from operations  including the pre tax charges  described above  related to the realignment of the operations of the company s german business unit  the sale of nti and the closure of a related support facility and severance for workforce reductions at the company s continuing operations  declined to a loss of million  and profit from operations  before the pre tax charges  declined to a loss of million  in both cases compared to a profit of million for the fiscal year 
interest and other income  net  principally investment income  declined to million for the fiscal year from million for the fiscal year 
the decrease in investment income was attributable to lower prevailing interest rates and the reduction in cash available for investment during the fiscal year 
the company s investments were primarily short term taxable instruments 
the company incurred no interest expense during the fiscal year compared with million during the fiscal year 
the company s interest expense was related primarily to its million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due  issued in   principal amount of which was converted into  shares of the company s common stock prior to february  the end of the company s fiscal year   of which was converted into  shares of the company s common stock on march   and  of which was redeemed by the company for cash on march  see liquidity and capital resources elsewhere in this item the company s effective income tax rate was for the fiscal year and the fiscal year 
net earnings for the fiscal year  including the pre tax charges  described above  related to the realignment of the operations of the company s german business unit  the sale of nti and the closure of a related support facility and severance for workforce reductions at the company s continuing operations  declined to a net loss of million  and net earnings  before the pre tax charges  declined to a net loss of million  in both cases from net earnings of million for the fiscal year 
basic and diluted earnings per share decreased from and  respectively  for the fiscal year to a loss per share of including the pre tax charges and to a loss per share of before the pre tax charges for the fiscal year 
the declines in net earnings and earnings per share were primarily attributable to the decline in the profit from operations and the charge for the closure of the business unit in arizona which formerly supplied delco electronics corporation with semi finished multilayer circuit boards 
liquidity and capital resources at march   the company s cash and temporary investments were million compared with million at march   the end of the company s fiscal year 
the increase in the company s cash and investment position at march  was attributable to cash provided by operations  lower non cash working capital items  the proceeds from the sale of the company s dielectric polymers  inc subsidiary and the refund of federal income taxes paid for prior years 
the company s working capital which includes cash and temporary investments was million at march  compared with million at march  the increase in working capital at march  compared with march  was due principally to higher cash and cash equivalents and lower accrued liabilities  offset in part by lower accounts receivable  inventories and prepaid expenses and other current assets and higher income taxes payable 
the decrease in accrued liabilities  accounts receivable  inventories and prepaid expenses and other current assets at march  compared with march  was a result principally of reduced operating activity in support of lower sales volumes 
the company s current ratio the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at march  compared with to at march  during the fiscal year  cash provided by the company s operations was enhanced by a small net reduction in non cash working capital items  resulting in million of cash provided from operating activities 
net expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million  million and million in the  and fiscal years  respectively 
the company expects the capital expenditures in the fiscal year to be approximately the same amount as the expenditures in the fiscal year 
the company sold its dpi subsidiary on june  for million in cash and recorded a pre tax gain of million in the fiscal year second quarter in connection with the sale 
at march  and march   the company had no long term debt 
during the company s fiscal year  million principal amount of notes was converted into  shares of the company s common stock  and immediately after the end of the fiscal year  million principal amount of notes was converted into  shares of the company s common stock  all at a conversion price of per share 
on march   the company redeemed million principal amount of notes for a redemption price of  including accrued interest for each  principal amount note pursuant to a previous announcement that on march  it would redeem all of the outstanding notes that were not converted on or before march  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
the company believes its financial resources will be sufficient  for the foreseeable future  to provide for continued investment in working capital and property  plant and equipment and for general corporate purposes 
such resources would also be available for appropriate acquisitions and other expansions of the company s business 
the company is not aware of any circumstances or events that are reasonably likely to occur that could materially affect its liquidity 
the company s liquidity is not dependent on the use of  and the company is not engaged in  any off balance sheet financing arrangements  such as securitization of receivables or obtaining access to assets through special purpose entities 
the company s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as lease agreements  consist only of the operating lease commitments described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the company has no long term debt  capital lease obligations  unconditional purchase obligations or other long term obligations  standby letters of credit  guarantees  standby repurchase obligations or other commercial commitments or contingent commitments  other than a standby letter of credit in the amount of million to secure the company s obligations under its workers compensation insurance program 
environmental matters the company is subject to various federal  state and local government requirements relating to the protection of the environment 
the company believes that  as a general matter  its policies  practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that its handling  manufacture  use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in accord with environmental laws and regulations 
however  mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies  which were generally in compliance with applicable laws at the time of the operations in question  the company  like other companies engaged in similar businesses  is a party to claims by government agencies and third parties and has incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs associated with environmental matters 
additional claims and costs involving past environmental matters may continue to arise in the future 
it is the company s policy to record appropriate liabilities for such matters when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
in the  and fiscal years  the company charged approximately million  million and million  respectively  against pre tax income for remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs including legal fees 
while annual expenditures have generally been constant from year to year  and may increase over time  the company expects it will be able to fund such expenditures from cash flow from operations 
the timing of expenditures depends on a number of factors  including regulatory approval of cleanup projects  remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties 
at march   the recorded liability in accrued liabilities for environmental matters was million compared with million at march  management does not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the liquidity  capital resources  business or consolidated financial position of the company 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a discussion of the company s commitments and contingencies  including those related to environmental matters 
critical accounting policies and estimates in response to financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  issued by the securities and exchange commission in december  the following information is provided regarding critical accounting policies that are important to the consolidated financial statements and that entail  to a significant extent  the use of estimates  assumptions and the application of management s judgment 
general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to sales allowances  bad debts  inventories  valuation of long lived assets  income taxes  restructuring  pensions and other employee benefit programs  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
sales allowances the company provides for the estimated costs of sales allowances at the time such costs can be reasonably estimated 
the company is focused on manufacturing the highest quality electronic materials and other products possible and employs stringent manufacturing process controls and works with raw material suppliers who have dedicated themselves to complying with the company s specifications and technical requirements 
however  if the quality of the company s products declined  the company may incur higher sales allowances 
bad debt the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketability based upon the age of the inventory and assumptions about future demand for the company s products and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
valuation of long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
important factors that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes in the use of the company s assets or strategy of the overall business 
income taxes carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assesses the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
restructuring during the fiscal year ended march   the company recorded significant charges in connection with the realignment of its north american fr business operations  the closures of its mass lamination operation in germany and its manufacturing facility in england and employee severance costs at a north american business unit  and during the fiscal year ended march   the company recorded significant charges in connection with the restructuring relating to the sale of nelco technology  inc  the closure of a related support facility and the realignment of dielektra  gmbh 
these charges include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and the settlements of contractual obligations resulting from the company s actions 
although the company does not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs incurred by the company may differ from these estimates 
contingencies and litigation the company is subject to a small number of proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to environmental  employment  product and other matters 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes in these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
pension and other employee benefit programs one of the company s subsidiaries in europe has significant pension costs that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates and wage inflation rates 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and wage costs  in selecting these assumptions 
changes in the related pension costs may occur in the future in addition to changes resulting from fluctuations in the company s related headcount due to changes in the assumptions 
the company s obligations for workers compensation claims and employee health care benefits are effectively self insured 
the company uses an insurance company administrator to process all such claims and benefits 
the company accrues its workers compensation liability based upon the claim reserves established by the third party administrator and historical experience 
the company s employee health insurance benefit liability is based on its historical claims experience 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries have a non contributory profit sharing retirement plan covering their regular full time employees 
in addition  the company s subsidiaries have various bonus and incentive compensation programs  most of which are determined at management s discretion 
the company s reserves associated with these self insured liabilities and benefit programs are reviewed by management for adequacy at the end of each quarterly reporting period 
factors that may affect future results
