item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis is based on  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  particularly note of notes to consolidated financial statements which presents net sales and revenues and operating income by operating segment 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements or disclosed in the related notes thereto 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from management s estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue is generally recognized when products are shipped or services are provided to customers 
revenue from the construction and sale of a home is included in income upon completion of construction and legal transfer of ownership to the customer 
time charges are recognized using the interest method 
instalment note payoffs received in advance of scheduled maturity prepayments cause time charge income to increase due to the recognition of remaining unamortized discounts arising from the application of abp at the note s inception 
instalment notes are placed on non accrual status when any portion of the principal or time charges is ninety days past due 
when placed on non accrual status  the related time charges receivable is reversed against time charges of the current period 
instalment notes are removed from non accrual status when principal and time charges become current 
recoveries of advanced taxes and insurance related to instalment notes are recognized as income when collected 
for the company s methane gas operations  revenues are recognized when the gas has been transferred to the customers pipeline  at which time transfer of title occurs 
revenue earned by shipping cargo by ocean vessel is recognized under international shipping standards as defined by incoterms  when title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
given the diversity of the company s businesses  many transactions have unique characteristics  which have to be analyzed on a case by case basis 
this diversity of products and contracts can lead to variations in the timing of income recognition 
however  most transactions are not individually significant  nor could they materially impact earnings 
allowances for losses on instalment notes and trade and other accounts receivables are based  in large part  upon judgments and estimates of expected default rates on the pool of homogeneous instalment notes and specific identification of problem trade accounts and other receivables 
significantly weaker than anticipated economic conditions could impact customers ability to pay or could impact the value of underlying collateral such that actual losses are greater than the amounts provided for in these allowances 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees  including pensions and postretirement healthcare 
the company records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by generally accepted accounting principles  which include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  assumed rates of return  compensation increases  turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits  decreasing gradually to in and remaining level thereafter 
the discount rate is based on a model portfolio of aa rated bonds with a maturity matched to the estimated payouts of future pension benefits 
the expected return on plan assets is based on the company s expectation of the long term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds  which was modeled based on the current and projected asset mix of the funds and considering the historical returns earned on the type of assets in the funds 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
as required by us gaap  the effects of the modifications are amortized over future periods 
based on information provided by its independent actuaries and other relevant sources  the company believes that the assumptions used are reasonable 
assumed health care cost trend rates  discount rates  expected return on plan assets and salary increases have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the pension and health care plans 
a one percentage point change in the trend rate for these assumptions would have the following effects in thousands percentage point increase percentage point decrease health care cost trend effect on total of service and interest cost components  effect on postretirement benefit obligation   discount rate effect on postretirement service and interest cost components effect on postretirement benefit obligation   effect on current year postretirement expense  effect on pension service and interest cost components effect on pension benefit obligation   effect on current year pension expense   expected return on plan assets effect on current year pension expense   rate of compensation increase effect on pension service and interest cost components  effect on pension benefit obligation   effect on current year pension expense   the company also has significant liabilities for uninsured or partially insured employee related liabilities  including workers compensation liabilities  miners black lung benefit liabilities and liabilities for various life and health benefits 
the recorded amounts of these liabilities are based on estimates of loss from individual claims and on estimates determined on an actuarial basis from historical experience 
workers compensation and black lung benefit liabilities are also affected by discount rates used 
changes in the frequency or severity of losses from historical experience  changes in discount rates or actual losses on individual claims that differ materially from estimated amounts could affect the recorded amount of these liabilities 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate on the discounted workers compensation liability would decrease the liability by million  while a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the liability by million 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate on the discounted black lung liability would decrease the liability by million  while a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the liability by million 
indefinite lived assets are reviewed annually for impairment 
the fair value of each of the company s reporting units was individually determined using valuation models reflecting the expected future cash flow projections related to each reporting unit  which were discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate and adjusted for comparable industry earnings multiples 
the company s reporting units are similar  although not identical  to its reporting segments 
this analysis indicated that the aimcor reporting units carrying value  including its tax deductible goodwill  exceeded its fair value 
the company then determined that the carrying value of the aimcor reporting units goodwill exceeded the fair value of its goodwill by million 
this goodwill impairment resulted from a change in the profitability of the business since its acquisition due to increased competition and eroding industry margins 
the company is involved in litigation  investigations  and claims arising out of the normal conduct of its business  including those relating to commercial transactions  as well as to environmental  health and safety matters 
the company estimates and accrues its liabilities resulting from such matters based on a variety of factors  including outstanding legal claims and proposed settlements  assessments by internal and external counsel of pending or threatened litigation  and assessments by environmental engineers and consultants of potential environmental liabilities and remediation costs 
the company believes it has adequately accrued for these potential liabilities  however facts and circumstances may change that could cause the actual liability to exceed the estimates  or that may require adjustments to the recorded liability balances in the future 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company is in dispute with the internal revenue service the irs on a number of federal income tax issues 
the company believes that its tax filing positions have substantial merit and it intends to vigorously defend these positions 
the company has established reserves that it feels are sufficient to address claims  including related interest and penalties  where its defense may be unsuccessful or where a settlement of issues may be warranted 
the amount of the reserve is based on an assessment by management of both the probability and extent of loss  in consultation with outside advisors  for each of the disputed issues involved 
since the issues involved are highly complex  are subject to the uncertainties of extensive litigation and or administrative processes and may require an extended period of time to reach ultimate resolution  it is possible that management s estimate of this liability could change 
installment notes receivable from the sale of jwh s homes are initially recorded at the discounted value of the future instalment note payments using an imputed interest rate in accordance with apb opinion no 
 interest on receivables and payables 
the imputed interest rate used represents the estimated prevailing market rate of interest for credit of similar terms issued to customers with similar credit ratings to jwh s customers 
the company estimates this rate by adding a credit spread and a margin to cover costs and expected losses to a benchmark funding rate 
this rate is periodically compared to rates charged by competitors and other lenders to customers of similar credit quality to validate that the methodology results in a market rate of interest 
these estimates affect revenue recognition by impacting the allocation of income between the amount recognized from the construction of the home and the amount recognized over the life of the instalment note as time charge income 
variations in the estimated market rate of interest used to initially record instalment notes receivable could affect the timing of income recognition 
results of operations year ended december  and net sales and revenues for the year ended december  were billion  an increase of million from the year ended december  revenue increases within the homebuilding  carbon and metals  and financing segments were partially offset by decreases in the industrial products and natural resources segments 
homebuilding revenues improved on increased unit completions and a higher average selling price 
carbon and metals revenues increased due to increased volumes and pricing in specialty metals and furnace coke 
financing revenues increased primarily due to higher prepayment speeds 
industrial products revenue decreased due to a decrease in shipments of ductile iron pipe during  reflecting the impact the national recession had on demand for these products  combined with lower pricing due to intense pricing competition within the industry 
revenues were lower in natural resources due to a decline in natural gas prices  a million federal excise tax refund claim related to coal export sales recognized in the prior year  and the impact of the mine no 
accident 
cost of sales  exclusive of depreciation  of billion was of net sales in the period versus billion and of net sales in the comparable period of the increase of million is primarily due to an increase in completed homes within the homebuilding segment  higher petroleum coke costs in carbon and metals  higher production costs and higher scrap iron prices in industrial products  partially offset by reduced volumes in the industrial products segment and productivity improvements of million in  compared to million in reflected in both cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses 
the cost reductions and productivity improvements realized in and came from the elimination of manufacturing waste  improvements in yield  process improvements and simplifications  restructuring efforts in and other workforce reductions 
in  cost of sales reflects a million reduction in the liability for black lung benefits in the natural resources segment 
depreciation for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million from the same period in due primarily to increases at industrial products related to the implementation of new software million and at natural resources for new equipment purchased following the accident at mine no 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  compared to million in the slight increase in expenses for was primarily due to a million charge to bad debt expense related to a carbon and metal s customer that filed for bankruptcy protection  an increase in professional fees related to converting time charge income to the interest method early in the year  continued expansion into new homebuilding markets and higher legal and other professional expenses in industrial products and in corporate functions 
these increases were substantially offset by decreases related to various productivity and cost reduction projects in place throughout the company including a reduction in corporate headquarters staff in the expense reflects a million charge to provide a legal reserve for an adverse verdict against one of the company s subsidiaries in a contract dispute  offset by a million reduction in the allowance for losses on trade receivables for the natural resources segment 
provision for losses on instalment notes increased to million in the period  compared to million in due to slightly higher levels of losses on resales of repossessed homes 
interest and amortization of debt expense was million in the period  a decrease of million from the same period in primarily due to lower interest rates and reduced borrowings 
the average rate of interest for the year ended december   was as compared to for the year ended december  amortization expense for goodwill and other intangibles was million in the period  compared to million from the same period in the decrease of million was due to the adoption of fas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets as of january  which requires the discontinuance of amortization for all goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
the company s effective tax rate for the year ended december  of differed from the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to a million tax benefit related to the november sale of jw window components  the utilization of certain federal tax credits principally related to the company s mining operations  and the effect of state and foreign income taxes 
the million tax benefit was from an increased capital loss carryforward due to a change in the consolidated return loss disallowance rules  which favorably affected the company s previous treatment of the november sale of jw window components 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  of differed from the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to amortization of goodwill  the utilization of certain federal tax credits  and the effect of state and foreign income taxes 
results for include a million pre tax impairment charge to write off certain petroleum coke handling assets at carbon and metals 
restructuring and impairment charges totaling million in include a million charge associated with the planned shutdown of certain chemical operations at sloss and a million charge for severance related to headcount reductions from restructurings  principally at the corporate headquarters and in the carbon and metals segment 
the period included an million federal excise tax refund credit and a million pre tax charge related to the coal mining accident at natural resources 
this charge principally included costs and expenses associated with the accident and the idling of mine no 
that were not covered by insurance 
the net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  which included a charge of million  net of tax  or per diluted share  from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the transitional goodwill impairment charge associated with the initial adoption of fas no 
in  net income was million  or per diluted share  which included approximately million  or per diluted share  of after tax goodwill amortization  which is no longer being expensed under fas no 
on a comparable basis  before the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  net income for the year ended december  was per diluted share  up or per diluted share  versus a comparable per diluted share in the period 
the current and prior period results also include the impact of the factors discussed in the following segment analysis 
segment analysis homebuilding net sales and revenues were million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the prior period 
as compared to the prior year  the company completed more homes in and had an increase in average net selling price 
average net selling price increased as a result of the company s ongoing strategy to market and sell new product options  amenity upgrades and larger  more upscale models 
for the year ended december  homes completed   average net selling price   sales of stick built homes increased by units  or in  while modular homes sales fell to units in  compared to in the prior year 
operating income was million for the year ended december  compared to million in the prior year period 
the million increase was principally caused by a million decrease in goodwill amortization  higher average selling prices and increased unit completions 
margins increased principally from cost reductions and productivity improvements 
financing net sales and revenues were million in the period  an increase of million from million for the prior year period 
the increase reflects a million increase in time charge income principally resulting from increased recognition of unamortized discounts which occurs when payoffs are received in advance of maturity offset by lower portfolio yields 
operating income net of interest expense associated with mid state mortgage backed debt was million in the period  up significantly from million in the prior year  primarily as the result of faster prepayment speeds of in the period compared to in the prior year period and million lower interest expense  offset by a million increase in the provision for losses on installment notes 
delinquencies the percentage of amounts outstanding over days past due were at december   unchanged from december  repossession inventory units at december  increased to units million  compared to units million at december  industrial products net sales and revenues were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from million for the year ended december  the decrease is due to a decrease in average price per ton for pipe products attributable to pricing competition within the industry  fewer ductile iron pipe shipments  and a decrease in pass through prime metal costs for aluminum products  which were partially offset by higher aluminum shipments 
the economic downturn at the beginning of the year negatively impacted sales in the first half of the year as us pipe customers deferred and delayed construction and water projects 
volumes increased during the second half of as previously delayed projects were re started 
third and fourth quarter shipments were and higher than the comparable periods in  which partially offset lower shipments during the first half of compared to the year ended december   us pipe revenues were down  average price per ton for pipe products decreased  and pipe shipments decreased  while aluminum shipments for the period were higher than the period 
overall  us pipe product price reductions reduced sales compared to by million 
jw aluminum has increased aluminum shipments by expanding their building products customer base 
operating income of million for the year ended december  was down million from million for the year ended december  operating income for jw aluminum was up million compared to  primarily due to higher volumes and improved productivity 
operating income for us pipe was down million compared to operating income decreased due to the lower volumes and decreases of million in prices for us pipe products  million of higher scrap iron costs  million of increased legal expenses and million of severance expenses related to a workforce reduction at us pipe 
this was partially offset by a million reduction in goodwill amortization  increased aluminum shipments  and improved productivity at u 
s pipe and jw aluminum from implementation of productivity initiatives such as the six sigma program 
carbon and metals net sales and revenues were million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the prior year 
aimcor metals revenues increased million due to higher volumes compared to the prior year  which included the temporary shut down of a significant production plant  and a short term market price spike in ferro molybdenum that increased revenues by million 
sloss revenues were million higher than as a result of higher volumes and pricing in furnace coke  which were partially offset by the closure of the birmingham chemical plant and lower fiber sales in aimcor carbon revenues were million higher than prior year due to higher calcined coke pricing  which reflects a pass through of higher product costs  and additional revenues from in refinery services at gulf coast refineries  partially offset by lower volumes from renegotiated supplier contracts 
operating income of million was million below the prior year 
operating income includes a million charge to selling  general and administrative expense as a result of a customer bankruptcy at sloss and a pre tax impairment charge of million to write off certain petroleum coke handling assets located in the gulf coast region 
these were partially offset by an million reduction in goodwill amortization  furnace coke volume increases and productivity improvements 
consolidation of major oil refiners and intense competition continued to put significant volume and margin pressures on the carbon businesses  further reducing its operating income 
a contract with a major domestic refinery expired in march although a revised contract was negotiated  the negative impact on margins in was approximately million associated primarily with increased costs to purchase petcoke under this revised contract 
to offset these impacts  the business has been aggressively reducing costs as well as pursuing new contracts for additional volumes and new services 
prior year operating income included a million charge associated with the shutdown of certain of the chemical operations at sloss 
natural resources net sales and revenues were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from the million in the prior year period 
the decrease in net sales and revenues in the current period is attributable to a million excise tax refund in the prior year and a decrease in methane gas selling prices  which was partially offset by an increase in coal selling prices 
although mine no 
was shutdown until june  longwall efficiency in mines no 
and increased the tons available for sale 
for the year ended december  average natural gas selling price per mcf billion cubic feet of natural gas sold number of natural gas wells average coal selling price per ton tons of coal sold million million the average natural gas selling prices shown reflect the impact in of approximately million of income recognized from gains on hedges of natural gas prices placed on anticipated production and sales in early for the year ended december   natural resources had operating income of million  compared to million for the year ended december  prior year operating income included a million excise tax refund claim  a million pre tax charge related to the accident at mine no 
 a million reduction in the liability for black lung benefits  and a million reduction in the allowance for losses on trade receivables 
operating income for also included million paid to the company by sonat for a natural gas reservation fee 
under the terms of the agreement  this fee was no longer paid after december  excluding these items  operating income for the segment increased by approximately million 
operating income for improved due to a increase in coal selling prices  partially offset by a increase in average cost per ton of coal produced resulting from inefficiencies associated with the start up of mine no 
results also reflect a decrease in the selling price of natural gas as compared to the prior year 
during the third quarter of  natural resources returned to full production following the mine no 
accident 
business interruption and property insurance covered the impact on operating results of reduced production and shipments and higher costs during the recovery period 
natural resources recognized million and million of business interruption insurance proceeds as a reduction to cost of sales in and  respectively 
the company s claims under the insurance policies have been substantially completed and approximately million of insurance proceeds have been collected through january general corporate expenses general corporate expenses were million during the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was principally due to reduced headcount and workforce savings million and other cost reduction efforts 
year ended december  and net sales and revenues for the year ended december  were billion  a decrease of million  or  from the amount for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to declines in unit sales of homes  fewer shipped tons of coal and lower demand for furnace coke  ductile iron pipe products and aluminum products 
the decrease in shipped tons of coal reflected large spot sales of excess coal inventories in the previous year at approximately our cost 
the decrease also reflects approximately million of non recurring miscellaneous income from life insurance policies recognized in the previous year 
these declines were partially offset by federal excise tax refund credits of million recognized in related to coal export sales in prior years and higher selling prices for homes  coal and gas 
cost of sales  exclusive of depreciation  of billion  was of net sales in versus billion and of net sales in the year ended december the cost of sales included approximately million of charges  primarily for inventory obsolescence and valuation reserves and environmental liabilities in the industrial products  carbon and metal and natural resources segments 
the cost of sales reflected a million reduction in the liability for black lung benefits in the natural resources segment 
the remaining decrease in cost of sales was primarily from reduced volumes 
the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was attributable to improved margins from the higher home  coal and gas prices  as well as approximately million in productivity improvements reflected in both cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses across all the businesses during the year 
this was partially offset by lower margins from the product mix at jw aluminum  higher petroleum coke costs  higher material costs at sloss  higher energy costs and lost fixed cost absorption in some of the industrial products and carbon and metals businesses 
the cost reductions and productivity improvements realized in came from the elimination of manufacturing waste  improvements in yields  process improvements and simplifications  restructuring efforts in and and other workforce reductions 
these efforts include a company wide headcount reduction of during depreciation for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million from the previous year 
this decrease was primarily attributable to a lower depreciable asset base as a result of a million pretax asset impairment charge to the company s coal mining assets taken in may  as well as million of accelerated depreciation taken on certain assets held for sale at jw aluminum in selling  general and administrative expenses were million during the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
the previous year s selling  general and administrative expenses included approximately million of charges  primarily for increased workers compensation expense million  an increase in the provision for losses on trade receivable in the carbon and metals segment million and for certain non restructuring related severance and environmental costs 
the expense reflected a million charge to provide a legal reserve for an adverse verdict against one of the company s subsidiaries in a contract dispute  offset by a million reduction in the allowance for losses on trade receivables for the natural resources segment 
the remaining decrease in expense from the previous year was attributable to the cost reductions referred to in the discussion of cost of sales above  including a reduction in corporate headquarters staff 
provision for losses on instalment notes was million during  compared to million during the increase in provision for losses was due to higher losses on the sales of repossessed properties resulting from management s effort to reduce houses held inventory and to provide a slightly higher level of allowance for losses in light of an overall weakening of the economy in the later part of interest and amortization of debt expense was million during the year ended december  compared to million during the average rate of interest in the period was compared to during lower interest expense resulted from the lower interest rates as well as decreased average borrowings  principally from paying down senior debt 
results for included a million charge related to a coal mining accident at jim walter resources in september this accident resulted in the death of thirteen miners and significant damage to mine no 
the mine was reopened in the second quarter of the charge principally included costs and expenses associated with the accident and the idling of the mine that were not covered by insurance 
restructuring and impairment charges totaling million in included a million charge associated with the shutdown of certain chemical operations at sloss and a million charge for severance related to headcount reductions from restructurings  principally at the corporate headquarters and in the carbon and metals segment 
the million charge in consisted principally of a million impairment charge at jim walter resources  a million charge relating to the restructuring of aimcor s european operations  a million charge for the closure of sloss alexandria  indiana fiber plant and million associated with executive and other severance arrangements 
the company s effective tax rate in and differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the amortization of goodwill  which is not deductible for tax purposes excluding amounts related to the aimcor acquisition  and nonconventional fuel tax credits 
taxes for the period also reflected recording of a valuation allowance associated with certain tax benefits which are not likely to be realized and the recognition of a tax reserve for the loss of certain tax litigation relating to leveraged buyout costs 
net income for the year ended december  was million compared to a net loss of million in the prior year 
the company s diluted net income per share in was compared to a diluted net loss per share of during the and results also reflect the factors discussed in the following segment analysis 
segment analysis homebuilding net sales and revenues were million during  a decrease of million  or  from the prior year 
this decrease reflects fewer completed homes than in the prior year 
the decrease in homes completed was partially offset by an increase in average net selling price 
the average net selling price increased as a result of new product options  amenity upgrades and consumer preference for more upscale models 
for the year ended december  homes completed   average net selling price   operating income increased by million from the prior year period to million 
this increase is primarily due to higher average net selling prices and improved operating margins attributable to lower material costs and productivity improvements  partially offset by lower revenues from fewer unit completions 
in addition  the prior year included approximately million of severance expenses 
financing net sales and revenues in were million  up million  or above the prior year 
this increase reflects a million increase in time charge income principally resulting from recognition of unamortized discounts from an increase in payoffs received in advance of maturity 
prepayment speeds for were compared to in the prior year 
operating income net of interest expense associated with mid state s mortgage backed debt was million during  million higher than in the prior year 
this increase is primarily the result of the increased time charge income  reduced interest expense due to lower interest rates and lower insurance reserves in the company s captive insurance business 
industrial products net sales and revenues in were million  down million from the prior year  reflecting decreased demand for the segment s products resulting from a weakened economy 
the economic downturn resulted in decreased and delayed shipments at us pipe as customers deferred and delayed construction and water projects 
shipments of pipe products declined by  tons  or  in as compared to the prior year 
revenues at us pipe declined by million compared to jw aluminum s revenues also declined million from the prior year on a decline in pounds shipped  resulting principally from reduced demand for its fin stock products used in air conditioners 
reflecting these significant volume declines  operating income for the segment of for the year ended december  was million lower than in operating income at us pipe declined by million as lower scrap iron costs  other cost reductions and productivity improvements offset much of the impact of declining volume 
most of the remaining decline in operating income occurred at jw aluminum and was attributable to lower volume in specialty products  lower prices and a shift in product mix to lower margin building products 
carbon and metals net sales and revenues decreased million in  or  from the prior year 
weakness in the domestic steel industry  caused by competition from foreign suppliers and a weakening economy  significantly impacted sales at sloss and aimcor metals 
sloss revenues decreased by million from  principally due to reduced sales of furnace coke 
aimcor metals revenues were million lower on reduced demand from steelmakers for its ferroalloys 
operating income for the segment for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million from included in operating income in is a million charge associated with the shutdown of certain of the chemical operations at sloss 
operating income for included charges totaling million  including million related to the restructuring of aimcor s european operations  million for the closure of sloss alexandria fiber plant  a million increase in the allowance for losses on accounts receivable and additional charges totaling million for various inventory and environmental reserves 
excluding these items  sloss had operating income lower than due to weakness in the furnace coke market million  higher coal and other materials costs million  lost fixed cost absorption million and lower chemical volumes million 
these negatives were offset by significant headcount and other cost reductions and productivity improvements at sloss 
operating income was also million lower at aimcor metals as the result of weak volumes in the metals additive business 
consolidation of the refiners and intense competition put significant volume and margin pressures on the carbon businesses  further reducing its operating income 
several significant contracts expired in and were not renewed 
natural resources net sales and revenues were million in  up million  or  over the prior year 
revenues in included federal excise tax refund credits of million related to coal export sales in prior years 
revenues reflected a significant decrease in the tons of coal sold in as compared to  principally due to large spot sales of excess coal inventories in the prior year at approximately cost  as well a reduced sales resulting from lower production due to the accident in mine no 
mine no 
shut down after the accident in september and remained closed through the end of the year 
the decrease in revenues from lower shipments was more than offset by higher average prices received for both coal and natural gas 
for the year ended december  average natural gas selling price per mcf billion cubic feet of natural gas sold number of natural gas wells average coal selling price per ton tons of coal sold million million the average natural gas selling prices shown reflect the impact in of approximately million of income recognized from gains on hedges of natural gas prices placed on anticipated production and sales in early operating income during was million  compared to an operating loss of million in included in the operating income in is the million pre tax charge related to the accident at mine no 
 the million of income from excise tax refund claims  a million reduction in the liability for black lung benefits and a million reduction in the allowance for losses on trade receivables 
the operating loss for included a million impairment charge related to two of the mines and other inventory and impairment charges totaling approximately million 
excluding these items  operating income for the segment increased by approximately million from to this is primarily due to the improvements in coal and gas prices and a decline in production costs from productivity enhancements and successful cost reduction efforts in the mining operations 
profitability remained strong despite lower shipments due to the mining accident as business interruption insurance offset the impact 
for the year  the company recognized million of business interruption insurance proceeds in income  of which had been collected as of december  operating income in both and included natural gas reservation fees of approximately million paid to the company by sonat 
seven months ended december  and net sales and revenues for the seven months ended december  were billion  an increase of million  or  above the comparable seven month period in the increase was primarily attributable to strong volume growth in the industrial products  carbon and metals  and natural resources segments  offset by lower period over period coal prices and a decline in time charges revenues received from mid state s instalment note portfolio 
cost of sales  exclusive of depreciation  of million was of net sales in the period versus million and of net sales in the comparable period of the increase in cost of sales was principally the result of higher volumes and higher energy costs 
the increase in cost of sales as a percent of net sales reflects lower gross profit margins realized on coal sales due to declining coal prices  despite significant productivity improvements in mining operations 
this increase was partially offset by cost reductions and productivity improvements in other business segments  lower lumber and materials cost for homebuilding and higher gross profit margins in the carbon and metals segment 
depreciation for the seven month transition period in was million  a decrease of million from the same period in this decrease was primarily attributable to lower depreciation expense resulting from the million pretax asset impairment charge to the company s coal mining assets taken in may selling  general and administrative expenses of million were of net sales and revenues in the period  compared to million and in the increase in expenses was due to higher selling expenses from increased sales volumes  increased expenditures associated with upgrading information technology and increased professional fees  partially offset by lower expenses from cost reduction programs 
provision for losses on instalment notes of million were of time charges in the period  compared to million and in the increase in provision for losses was due to higher losses on the sale of repossessed properties in the period resulting from management s effort to reduce houses held in inventory at the end of the period 
interest and amortization of debt expense was million in the transition period versus million in the comparable period 
the average rate of interest in the period was as compared to in higher interest expense from higher interest rates and increased borrowings in the non recourse mortgage backed asset backed notes was partially offset by lower other senior debt borrowings 
restructuring and impairment charges were million in the transition period compared to a million credit in the comparable period 
restructuring charges in the transition period included million of severance charges for executives and other corporate personnel  million attributable to the restructuring of aimcor s european operations  including the closure of aimcor s luxembourg office and reductions in personnel at aimcor s headquarters and million for the closure of an underperforming sloss slag fiber manufacturing plant in alexandria  indiana 
the credit in was for the reversal of mine no 
shutdown costs previously recorded in the fiscal year ended may  the company s effective tax rate in the and periods differed from the statutory tax rate primarily due to amortization of goodwill  which is not deductible for tax purposes excluding amounts related to the aimcor acquisition  and nonconventional fuel tax credits in the transition period 
net income for the seven months ended december  was million compared to million in the comparable period 
the company s diluted earnings per share in the period was 
compared to 
in the period 
the current and prior period results also reflect the factors discussed in the following segment analysis 
segment analysis homebuilding net sales and revenues were million in the transition period  an increase of million  or  from the seven month period 
net sales and revenues increased due to an increase in average net selling price per home sold  from  in the period to  in this price increase was itself offset by a decrease in the number of homes sold  from  units in the period to  units in the higher average net selling price resulted from new product options  amenity upgrades and consumer preference for more upscale models being offered by jwh  as well as from price increases instituted in the prior year 
operating income was million in the transition period  million above the prior year period 
this increase was primarily due to a decline in raw material costs primarily lumber  other cost reductions and productivity improvements and lower goodwill amortization in the period compared to financing net sales and revenues were million in the transition period  a decrease of million  or  from the seven month period 
this decrease reflects a million decline in time charge income from million in the period  to million in the transition period 
the decrease in time charges resulted from a reduction in payoffs received in advance of maturity and a reduction in the total number of instalment note accounts  partially offset by an increase in the average balance per account in the portfolio

the company used proceeds from the mid state trust ix variable funding loan agreement to pay down all the remaining debt under trust ii 
trust iv owns the beneficial interest in trust ii and as a result  all collections on trust ii accounts are being used to pay interest  expenses and principal of trust iv 
the company believes that the mid state trust ix variable funding loan agreement will provide mid state with the funds needed to purchase the instalment notes and mortgages generated by jwh 
it is anticipated that one or more permanent financings similar to the trust x asset backed notes and other previous mid state asset backed financings will be required over the next several years to repay future borrowings under the trust ix variable funding loan agreement
