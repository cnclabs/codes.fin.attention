item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks described in certain factors that may affect our business and elsewhere in this annual report 
you should read the following discussion with selected financial data and our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we have been operating in an increasingly challenging business  economic and regulatory environment 
during the past three years  the major us market indices have experienced a severe decline and significant volatility 
the weak and uncertain economic climate  increased unemployment rates  reduced capital raising  decreased market capitalization  ongoing geopolitical and global conflicts  coupled with the current corporate governance and accounting concerns  have contributed to a decreased pace of global economic growth 
this has resulted in significantly lower equity prices  decreased corporate activity  increased market volatility  decreased trading volumes  and a generally more difficult business environment 
in addition  intense competition from other liquidity providers and trading venues  together with recent sec regulations and interpretive initiatives  have prompted us to reduce our prices significantly  which has resulted in decreased revenues and losses from operations 
our transaction fee revenues have declined from a record billion in to billion in and our net income decreased from million to a loss of million  primarily due to a million charge for goodwill impairment  a restructuring charge and a write down in our investments 
in the past  we have implemented various cost reduction plans and in december  we began implementing a cost reduction plan that targets a further reduction in operating costs of million  on an annualized basis  by the end of our transaction fees earned from our customers trading equity securities have represented a substantial part of our revenues and accounted for approximately of our transaction fee revenues in and during the first two months of  the us markets continued to weaken and trading volumes continued to decline 
the average daily trading volumes in nasdaq quoted and us exchange listed stocks decreased from billion shares in the fourth quarter of to billion shares during the first two months of our average daily trading volumes have also decreased 
our average daily trading volumes in nasdaq quoted and us exchange listed stocks have decreased from million shares in the fourth quarter of to million shares during the first two months of this decrease in trading volumes has had a negative effect on our transaction fee revenue 
in addition  in march  we announced a reduction of of our global staffing levels  approximately positions  resulting from attrition and the eliminations of positions 
we expect that these staff reductions will result in an estimated million reduction in our operating costs  on an annualized basis  by the end of this staff reduction is part of our continued focus on cost reduction and is in addition to the million cost reduction target previously announced 
acquisition of island and special dividend on september   we completed our acquisition of island 
we now operate two of the largest alternative trading systems atss trading nasdaq quoted stocks 
we believe this transaction brings together complementary capabilities in the global equity markets  creating a company better able to serve customer needs 
we expect the merger to deliver synergies as a result of expanded liquidity and cost savings in technology  clearing  facilities and compensation 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  we issued  shares of our common stock to island stockholders and converted options  warrants and stock appreciation rights to holders of island options  warrants and stock appreciation rights outstanding at september  subsequent to the acquisition  we incurred various non cash charges related to the amortization of identified intangible assets and the conversion of existing island equity options 
in addition  we incurred charges to enable us to achieve on going cost synergies 
in connection with our acquisition of island  we paid a per common share cash dividend to our stockholders of record as of september   which represented a distribution of million  of which million was paid to reuters 
we paid this dividend on october  business environment over the past five years  the major us market indices experienced substantial growth followed by a severe decline and significant volatility 
for example  the dow jones industrial average increased from  in january  reached a peak of  in january  dropped to a low of  in october and increased to  by the end of december the nasdaq composite experienced similar volatility  increasing from  in january to a peak of  in march  then experienced a severe decline to  by the end of december this trend comes at the end of a period of tremendous growth in the global equity markets 
our transaction fee revenues grew at a compound annual growth rate of from million in to billion in this growth in revenues was primarily driven by increases in share volumes in the equity securities markets and by our expanded international business 
for example  the total number of shares of us exchange listed and nasdaq quoted stocks traded increased at a compound annual rate of from billion in to billion in however  beginning in the second half of through  the growth rate of the volume of trading in the us markets began to slow  and in  nasdaq market volumes declined  although the us exchanges still maintained moderate growth 
we believe the slowdown in trading volumes and the downward pressure on share prices  has been caused in part by an overall decline in the global economy  particularly in the us the growth rate in the total number of shares of us exchange listed and nasdaq quoted stocks traded decreased to from to as a result of these market and competitive pressures  we significantly reduced our prices in which contributed to a decrease in our transaction fee revenues to billion in for the year to year growth rates  see selected financial data 
the international equity markets have experienced similar volatility and downward share prices as the us markets 
our international equity transaction volume increased at a compound annual rate of  from million transactions in to million transactions in for the year to year growth rates  see selected financial data 
our transaction fee revenue earned from non us equities has grown over the past five years from million to a peak of million in however  these fees declined to million in primarily due to price declines in non us securities 
our net transaction fee revenue earned from non us equities a non gaap financial measurement  which excludes revenues directly related to soft dollar and commission recapture  has grown over the past five years from million in to a peak of million in however  these fees began to decline in  and in  declined to million  primarily due to price reductions in non us securities 
our revenues from international transactions are determined on the basis of the value of transactions  rather than the number of shares traded 
in addition  we continue to operate in an increasingly challenging business environment due to recent significant regulatory changes 
the securities markets and the brokerage industry in which we operate are highly regulated 
many of the regulations applicable to us may have the effect of limiting our activities  including activities that might be profitable  or causing us to modify our business model in ways that may adversely affect our revenues 
our market share our share trading volume in us exchange listed and nasdaq quoted stocks has increased at a compound annual rate of from billion in to billion in our share trading volume grew to billion in  which included billion from island 
see calculation of instinet ats and island ats combined volumes 
for the year to year growth rates  see selected financial data 
our share of the total trading volume in us exchange listed and nasdaq quoted stocks  while fluctuating over the period  increased from in to in our instinet ats alone accounted for approximately of the total trading volume in the nasdaq quoted stock in following our acquisition of island  our two atss accounted for approximately of the total trading volume in nasdaq quoted stocks for the three months ended december  we experienced a decline in our nasdaq market share beginning in the second half of this was primarily attributable to lower volumes from our broker dealer customers  increased price competition and the introduction of nasdaq s supersoes system in the third quarter of the following graph depicts our share volume and our transaction fee revenues  on a quarterly basis  from to 
graph 
pricing changes to respond to the intense price competition and our declining market share  particularly for nasdaq quoted trading  in september  we reduced our pricing  implementing a new pricing schedule for our us broker dealer customers and adjusted certain pre set volume levels at which we offer those customers lower per share transaction fees 
in march  we implemented a new pricing plan to offer further pricing incentives to our us broker dealer customers  reducing prices paid by broker dealers trading nasdaq quoted stocks by approximately and simplifying the pricing schedule by further adjusting certain pre set volume levels 
we will continue to monitor future price competition and evaluate our pricing structure as part of our ongoing efforts to maintain and expand the liquidity pools of our two atss 
these price changes have significantly affected our average us equity transaction fee revenue per share  which decreased from in to our average us net equity transaction fee revenue per share a non gaap financial measurement decreased from in to in business expansion  cost reduction initiatives business realignment our expenses grew significantly from to  primarily due to increased transactions by our customers  as well as increased expenses related to our efforts to expand and diversify our activities  which has caused reductions in our margins 
in  we began developing a fixed income securities platform  which we launched in the spring of in the united states and europe 
in october  we began providing correspondent clearing services to a few brokers in the united states 
with the emergence of internet based retail brokerage as a significant and growing portion of the equity marketplace  we initially planned to develop our own internet based retail brokerage operation and  starting in  designed and developed a platform for this business 
these internal development efforts resulted in significant costs  which we expensed as incurred 
in response to the various regulatory and competitive changes in our business and in the marketplace  in  and  we engaged in various cost reduction plans and re aligned our core business focus  resulting in restructuring charges in december  we announced that based upon a review of market conditions and an evaluation of possible alternate strategies  we decided to terminate our retail brokerage efforts 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million in and million in between and  we incurred total expenses of million related to our retail brokerage initiative  including these restructuring charges 
in july  in order to address the declines in our margins  we announced a review of spending initiatives with the aim of reducing our underlying operating cost structure by approximately million annually compared to our total expenses in the first half of this program was completed in at a charge of million 
employee headcount levels were reduced by the departments primarily affected were various operational areas in technology support  sales and trading  administrative functions and clearing operations in our us and international offices 
we closed our office in sydney  australia  consolidated our european trading and clearing operations  significantly reducing the size of our zurich office  and in the us  closed the greenwich  detroit and seattle trading offices of our protrader subsidiary 
we also aggressively managed discretionary spending in areas such as marketing costs  professional fees and travel costs 
in march  in order to offset the impact of reduced revenues due to our price reductions to us broker dealer customers  we announced that we would reduce our annualized fixed operating costs by approximately million compared to our annualized fixed cost run rate in the fourth quarter of this program was substantially completed by the end of the first half of at a cost of million 
it included reducing staff levels by the departments primarily affected were various operational areas in technology support functions  clearing operations  sales and trading  and administrative functions in our us and international offices 
we closed the houston  los angeles and san jose trading offices of our protrader subsidiary  consolidated our european trading and clearing operations  significantly reduced the size of our offices in switzerland  uk and france  and consolidated our office space in the uk in may  we closed our fixed income trading platform 
against the background of a global economic slowdown and the uneven pace of acceptance of electronic fixed income trading platforms  the business had been unable to reach a critical mass 
as part of this shutdown  we recorded a discontinued operations charge  net of tax  of million in between and  we incurred a charge of million related to our fixed income business  including this restructuring charge 
in december  we announced that we had commenced a cost reduction plan to reduce operating costs by million on an annualized basis compared to the level in the third quarter of  as if island was included for the full quarter by the end of in order to achieve cost synergies in connection with our acquisition of island 
as part of this plan  we reduced our workforce by  or approximately of our global full time employees  consolidated office space within the new york city area and closed most of the remaining offices of our protrader subsidiary 
a charge of million was recorded in in connection with these measures 
we continue to evaluate further cost initiatives  which may result in future charges 
fixed and variable cost base as a result of the initiatives described above  we have begun to achieve a reduction in our expenses 
our total expenses  which included the charges for cost reduction initiatives  were billion in  billion in and billion in  however  our fixed cost base a non gaap financial measure decreased to million in  from million in and million in island contributed million to our fixed expenses in our fixed cost base excludes non operating expenses goodwill impairment and restructuring costs and variable costs soft dollar and commission recapture  broker dealer rebates and brokerage  clearing and exchange fees 
our variable expenses are generally related to transaction volumes as well as share volumes 
our average number of shares per transaction has declined primarily due to a change in our customer mix and increased trades  particularly from our broker dealer clients 
goodwill impairment during the third quarter of  we experienced a decline in our market capitalization  particularly towards the end of the quarter 
due to this significant decrease  instinet s book value exceeded its fair market value 
we believe that this significant decline in market value reflected the ongoing challenging business environment  declining business fundamentals  the commoditization of some of our services  the launch of significant competitive products and a difficult regulatory environment 
these events prompted us to perform a goodwill impairment test 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  based on the results of a valuation analysis prepared by an independent specialist  we determined that our existing goodwill had been completely impaired and as a result  we recorded a pre tax goodwill impairment loss of million  the remaining carrying value of our goodwill  as of september  this was a non cash charge and resulted in no reduction in tangible book value 
we recorded a related tax benefit of approximately million related to this charge 
other business acquisitions in february  we acquired lynch  jones ryan  a leading provider of specialized brokerage  research and commission recapture services to pension plan sponsors and managers  for million  in order to expand our services to certain customer groups 
in october  we acquired protrader  a provider of advanced trading technologies and electronic brokerage services 
this acquisition was intended to enhance our customer interface and order routing technology 
the acquisition excluded protrader s proprietary trading business 
the million purchase price consisted of million in cash and  shares of our common stock valued at million 
the shares issued in this transaction are eligible for resale subject to applicable limitations under the securities act of we granted registration rights with respect to these shares 
on january   pursuant to an existing option purchase agreement  we purchased harborview llc  a nyse floor brokerage firm for  we believe that this acquisition will reduce our execution costs and enhance our execution capabilities 
our reorganization and initial public offering effective september   we  together with reuters  reorganized our operations to combine all of our operations under one holding company structure 
prior to the reorganization  while most of our us business was conducted by our own direct or indirect subsidiaries  most of our international operations and some of our other activities were conducted by other companies affiliated with us within the reuters group 
in order to fund these international operations  we paid dividends to reuters  which then made corresponding capital contributions to the appropriate companies 
in the reorganization  reuters transferred various assets  liabilities and ownership interests in those companies to us 
on may   we converted our company from a delaware limited liability company into a delaware corporation  based on a conversion ratio of shares per membership interest 
in may  we completed an initial public offering of million shares at an offering price of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million in the offering after deducting our offering expenses 
management changes we have had several executive management changes beginning in in april  douglas m 
atkin  president and chief executive officer  resigned from instinet 
mark nienstedt  then chief financial officer  was appointed to serve as instinet s acting president and chief executive officer 
kenneth k 
marshall  then chief operating officer  also announced his retirement and jean marc bouhelier was appointed chief operating officer 
subsequent to the acquisition of island in september  edward j 
nicoll  then chairman of island  was appointed chief executive officer and director of instinet 
in november  john f 
fay was appointed chief financial officer of instinet 
mark nienstedt continued as instinet s president until his resignation on february   however  mr 
nienstedt continues to serve as director and officer of instinet 
effective january  andre villeneuve retired as instinet s executive chairman of the board of directors and ian strachan was appointed to succeed him as non executive chairman of the board 
seasonality we have experienced  and may continue to experience  significant seasonality in our business 
as a result of this and other factors described above  period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
non gaap financial measurement in evaluating our financial performance and results of operations  management reviews certain financial measures that are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards in the united states non gaap 
non gaap measurements do not have any standardized meaning and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies 
management uses non gaap financials measures in evaluating our operating performance 
in light of the use by management of these non gaap measurements to assess our operational performance  we believe it is useful to provide information with respect to these non gaap measurements so as to share this perspective of management 
these non gaap financials measures should be considered in the context with our gaap results 
a reconciliation of our non gaap measurements are provided below our transaction fees earned from our customers trading equity securities have represented  and continue to represent  a substantial part of our revenues 
gaap requires us to add our soft dollar and commission recapture expenses and broker dealer rebates  dollar for dollar  to related equity transaction fee revenues  which has a dilutive effect on our operating margins 
therefore  when evaluating our revenues from equity transactions  management reviews our net equity transaction fee revenue  based on us securities and us securities 
our net equity transaction fee revenues are calculated by subtracting the soft dollar and commission recapture expenses as well as broker dealer rebates from the related equity transaction fees  as well as non equity related revenues  and is calculated as follows year ended december  in thousands total transaction fee revenue  as reported    less non equity related transaction fee revenue    less soft dollar revenues and commission recapture expenses    less broker dealer rebates  net equity transaction fee revenue    u 
s transaction fee revenue from us us    less non equity related transaction fee revenue    less soft dollar revenues and commission recapture expenses from us us    less broker dealer rebates  net equity transaction fee revenue from us equities    us revenue per share average us equity transaction fee revenue per share  per side less non equity related transaction fee revenue less soft dollar revenues and commission recapture expenses from us us less broker dealer rebates average us equity net transaction fee revenue per share  per side non u 
s transaction fee revenue from non us non us    less non equity related transaction fee revenue less soft dollar revenues and commission recapture expenses from non u 
s equities    net equity transaction fee revenue from non us equities    our expense structure includes a certain level of fixed costs  as well as a variable cost base that fluctuates with customer transaction volumes as well as share volumes 
if demand for our brokerage services declines and we are unable to respond by adjusting our fixed cost base  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
therefore  we have undertaken cost reduction initiatives to reduce our fixed cost base 
we estimate our fixed cost base by subtracting line items that we have determined to be predominantly variable in nature 
some of these variable line items may contain a fixed component 
similarly  some of our fixed expense line items may contain a variable component 
management does not adjust for the variable or fixed component within each line item when analyzing our fixed cost base 
our fixed cost base is calculated as follows year ended december  in thousands total expenses  as reported    less brokerage  clearing and exchange fees    less soft dollar and commission recapture expenses    less broker dealer rebates  less restructuring   less goodwill impairment  less loss of fixed assets at the world trade center  less recovery of fixed assets lost  total fixed costs    revenues our revenues consist of transaction fees  interest and investment income 
transaction fees accounted for the significant portion of our revenues in these fees are commission and other revenues earned on our customers use of our various brokerage and related services  and fluctuate based upon share volumes and pricing changes 
these services include ecn transaction revenues  service bureau transaction fees  market data  communication  clearing and other brokerage services 
transaction fees also include soft dollar revenues and revenues that are subject to commission recapture which offset dollar for dollar the expenses we incur in paying for research from independent third parties and for commission recapture payments to pension plan and other fund sponsors 
ecn transaction fee revenues include commissions charged to broker dealers who consume liquidity from our ecns 
the commissions we charge to liquidity consumers more than offset the amount we pay broker dealers who liquidity to our ecns 
for transactions in us equity securities  we generally base our fees on a per share basis 
our broker dealer customers are subject to a fee schedule that provides for a per share amount that declines based upon pre set volume levels 
our institutional customers pay a per share amount based upon the customer s level of usage of our services 
for transactions in non us equity securities  we generally base our fees on the transaction value per trade as is customary in the international markets in which we operate  and also take into account the customer s level of trading activity 
as described above under overview  we have aggressively reduced pricing for our us broker dealer customers 
clearing fees are earned on a per ticket basis 
a ticket refers to one or more customer transactions grouped together for clearing purposes 
in some cases  a single transaction is cleared using more than one ticket 
interest income is interest earned on the cash provided as collateral on stock borrowing transactions related to our clearing business  our interest earning assets  which primarily consist of fixed income securities  and on our cash balances 
investment income consists of realized and unrealized gains and losses  dividends and other income earned on a series of strategic alliances and long term investments we have made in other companies  as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses from our marketable securities 
operating expenses employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries  incentive compensation and related employee benefits and taxes 
salaries and benefits account for just over half of our employee compensation and benefits expense 
many employees receive annual incentive compensation based on our overall operating results as well as their individual performance 
as a result  a portion of this expense fluctuates based on our operating results 
some employees  such as sales employees  receive periodic incentive compensation based on new customer acquisitions and revenues 
as part of our cost reduction initiatives  we have been reducing our headcount  which we expect will result in lower compensation expense in the future 
soft dollar and commission recapture expense consists primarily of expenses we incur to purchase research products from third parties for our customers in connection with our soft dollar research business  as well as commission recapture payments to pension plan and other fund sponsors 
our soft dollar and commission recapture expense fluctuates based upon the level of our customers demand for these services and overall market transaction volumes 
broker dealer rebates represents were commission rebates to broker dealers who provide liquidity to our ecns as part of our pricing incentives for broker dealers 
we charge commissions to broker dealers who consume liquidity  which is recorded as transaction fee revenue 
the commissions we charge to liquidity consumers more than offset the amount we pay to broker dealers who provide liquidity to our ecns 
brokerage  clearing and exchange fees include fees paid to clearing entities for clearing and settlement services  fees paid to floor brokers and exchanges for trade execution  and fees paid to third party vendors for data processing services 
these costs generally fluctuate based on transaction volumes 
communications and equipment expense consists primarily of costs for our network connections with our customers  costs for maintenance of our core network and other systems development efforts  costs for software  computers and other equipment  and fees for access to stock market data 
communications and equipment expense generally fluctuates based upon long term trends in our business activity 
certain elements of this expense  which we incur in anticipation of certain transaction volume levels  have both a fixed and variable nature 
once we incur these expenses initially  we may not incur them going forward on a recurring  annual basis 
as a result of the importance of our systems to the viability of our business  we continue to invest heavily in areas such as system capacity and reliability  increased functionality and performance  and security 
we also must modify our systems from time to time to comply with various regulatory requirements  such as the sec order handling rules  regulation ats and the introduction of decimalization 
the expenses we incur for these modifications may vary substantially from period to period 
we expect our communications and equipment expense to decrease slightly in as we leverage our improved network and systems efficiencies  as well as reduced costs from radianz  which provides us with network communications services 
see certain relationships and related transactions 
depreciation and amortization expense results primarily from the depreciation of the fixed assets we purchase  as well as the amortization of goodwill resulting from our acquisitions 
goodwill amortization was recorded until january   when we adopted new accounting rules  which require that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings 
in  we wrote off all of our goodwill 
occupancy expense includes the costs of leasing  furnishing and maintaining our office and operations space  primarily in the new york metropolitan area 
occupancy expense is primarily affected by increases or decreases in the number of employees and expansion or contraction of our services and related support functions 
we expect these costs to decrease in as we have consolidated our office space in the new york city area 
professional fees include fees paid to consultants as well as legal and accounting fees 
marketing and business development expense consists primarily of media  print and other advertising expenses incurred to create brand awareness  promote our services and introduce new products 
it also includes travel and client entertainment expenses 
other expenses consist primarily of interest costs related to securities lending activities by our clearing operations  administrative expenses  provision for bad debt  interest expense related to the use of our credit facilities and borrowings from reuters  if any  as well as other general office costs 
provision for income taxes includes taxes related to our income in each country or jurisdiction in which we operate 
the difference between our effective tax rate and the us statutory tax rate may differ period to period  but primarily results from state and local taxes in the us  foreign income taxes  valuation allowances against losses that may not be realized and the effect of certain non deductible expenses 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies related to our strategic alliances and long term investments investments and goodwill are the most critical accounting policies that requires us to make estimates and use judgments that could affect our results 
investments our investments are stated at estimated fair value as determined in good faith by management 
generally  we will initially value investments at cost as a proxy for fair value  and require that changes in value be established by meaningful third party transactions or a significant impairment in the financial condition or operating performance of the issuer  unless meaningful developments occur that otherwise warrant a change in the valuation of an investment 
factors considered in valuing individual investments include  without limitation  available market prices  type of security  purchase price  purchases of the same or similar securities by other investors  marketability  restrictions on disposition  current financial position and operating results  and other pertinent information 
we use our best judgment in estimating the fair value of these investments 
there are inherent limitations to any estimation technique 
the fair value estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of an amount that we could realize in a current transaction 
because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation  these estimated fair values do not necessarily represent amounts that might be ultimately realized  since such amounts depend on future circumstances  and the differences could be material 
in  we wrote down our investments in wr hambrecht co  archipelago holding llc  the nasdaq stock market  inc and knight roundtable europe ltd  by million  based upon management s best judgment of each investment s fair market value 
goodwill sfas requires that management perform a detailed review of the carrying value of the company s tangible and intangible assets 
in this process  management is required to make estimates and assumptions in order to determine the fair value of the company s assets and liabilities and projected future earnings using various valuation techniques 
management uses its best judgment and information available to it at the time to perform this review  as well as the services of an expert valuation specialist 
because management s assumptions and estimates are used in the valuation  actual results may differ 
in accordance with sfas  based on the results of a valuation analysis prepared by an independent specialist  we determined that our existing goodwill had been completely impaired and as a result  we recorded a pre tax goodwill impairment loss of million in in addition  based upon a review of the discounted cash flows of our protrader subsidiary  we incurred a goodwill impairment charge of million upon our adoption of sfas see note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies 
key statistical information the following table presents key transaction volume information  as well as certain other operating information

s exchange listed and nasdaq quoted stocks 
for a description of how we calculate our nasdaq share volumes  see nasdaq volume calculations and calculation of instinet ats and island ats volume combined volumes our net equity transaction fee revenues are calculated by subtracting the soft dollar and commission recapture expenses and broker dealer rebates from the related equity transaction fees 
gaap requires us to add our soft dollar and commission recapture expenses and broker dealer rebates  dollar for dollar  to related equity transaction fee revenues 
our average us net equity transaction fee revenue is calculated by dividing our net us equity transaction fee revenue for the buy and sell side of each transaction by our total us share volume 
island s results  subsequent to september   are consolidated with our results for the periods described 
in  our average us net equity transaction fee revenue has fluctuated significantly as was   and for the three months ended december   september   june  and march   respectively 
nasdaq volume calculations for purposes of calculating our published share volumes  we count the number of shares that are traded through us as broker once 
we do not count both sides of the transaction  although we usually receive transaction fees from parties on both sides of the transaction 
as a result  we treat a transaction of  shares on our system as a single  share transaction for purposes of calculating our share volumes 
we use the nasdaq share volumes published by nasdaq as resulting from the nasd s transaction reporting rules for our calculations  including our percentage of nasdaq share volume  where nasdaq share volume is the denominator 
historical amounts may be restated due to updates of volume information from nasdaq 
because of the structure of the nasdaq market  the sale of shares by one investor and purchase of those shares by another investor can require a series of transactions  most often through one or more market makers  all of which are reported to nasdaq and included by nasdaq in total transaction volume 
for example  in a  share purchase and sale involving two market makers  the  share sale by investor to market maker would be reported to nasdaq as a  share transaction by market maker the sale in turn by market maker of the same  shares to market maker would also be reported to nasdaq by market maker as a  share transaction 
finally  the purchase in turn of the same  shares by customer from market maker would be reported to nasdaq by market maker as a third  share transaction 
total nasdaq trading volume would thus be  shares 
we could act as agency broker in any one or more of these three transactions and would count any transaction in which we acted once in our published trading volume 
if  for example  we acted as broker in the transaction between market maker and market maker  we would act as broker for both parties  but our trading volume would be a total of  shares 
as another example  in a  share purchase and sale involving a single market maker  the  share sale by investor to market maker would be reported by market maker to nasdaq as a  share transaction  and the purchase in turn by investor from market maker would be reported by market maker to nasdaq as a second  share transaction 
total nasdaq trading volume would thus be  shares 
we could again act as agency broker in either or both of these two transactions and would count any transaction in which we acted once in our published trading volume 
if  for example  we acted as broker in the transaction between investor and market maker  we would report our trading volume as  shares 
as a final example  we or another broker could act as agency broker for two investors in the purchase and sale by them of  shares of a nasdaq quoted stock 
in this case  we act as agency broker for both parties but would report a single  share transaction to nasdaq  total nasdaq trading volume would be  shares  and our published trading volume would be  shares 
calculation of instinet ats and island ats combined volumes our two atss  instinet and the island ecn  currently operate independently  however  we disclose the volumes from our two atss on a combined basis 
currently  instinet customers have the option  for certain orders  to automatically send parts of orders that cannot be filled on the instinet system to the island system 
in calculating our combined volumes  we eliminate one side of these routed orders

primarily due to the acquisition of island in september  our various pricing changes  and the introduction of our broker dealer rebates  we increased our trading volumes and market share in nasdaq quoted and us exchange listed stocks between and  however  the decrease in our average pricing more than offset the effect of the increases in our trading volumes 
our trading volumes in nasdaq quoted stocks increased and our trading volumes in u 
s exchange listed stocks increased in  compared to island contributed or billion shares  of the increase in nasdaq quoted stocks and or billion shares  of the increase in us exchange listed stocks 
our share of volume in nasdaq quoted stocks  while fluctuating during the period  increased from in to in  and our share of volume in us exchange listed stocks increased from in to in our instinet ats alone accounted for of the total trading volume in the nasdaq quoted stocks for following our acquisition of island  our two atss accounted for of the total trading volume in nasdaq quoted stocks for the three months ended december  our average number of transactions per day in nasdaq quoted and us exchange listed stocks decreased from  in to  in our soft dollar revenues and our revenues that are subject to commission recapture  which are offset dollar for dollar by our soft dollar research payments and commission recapture expenses  decreased from million in to million in  primarily due to a decrease in our soft dollar revenues due to reduced use of this service partly offset by increased use of the commission recapture services provided by our lynch  jones and ryan subsidiary 
our transaction fee revenue earned from us equity transactions decreased from billion in to million in our transaction fee revenue earned from non us equities declined from million in to million in this amount represented of our total equity transaction fee revenue in  and in our net transaction fee revenue earned from us equity transactions a non gaap financial measurement  which excludes revenues directly related to soft dollar and commission recapture and broker dealer rebates  decreased from million in to million in due to the decrease in our average pricing resulting from lower rates for us broker dealer customers following the price reductions we initiated for this group in march our net transaction fee revenue earned from non us equities a non gaap financial measurement  which excludes revenues directly related to soft dollar and commission recapture and broker dealer rebates  declined from million in to million in this amount represented of our total net equity transaction fee revenue in  and in this increase was primarily due to a greater decrease in our us net equity transaction fees as a result of our price changes versus our non us net equity transaction fees 
interest revenue decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates  which affects the revenue generated by our stock borrowing activities related to our clearing services  as well as a decrease in our interest bearing cash and cash equivalents 
investments revenue decreased from a gain of million in to a loss of million in the loss was primarily due to write downs of million where management made a determination that the fair value of investments was impaired and million for investments accounted for under the equity method  offset by gains on our securities owned  including million on our sale of shares in the toronto stock exchange upon its demutualization and initial public offering in november expenses compensation and benefits expense decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our worldwide headcount  particularly in our us offices  the closure of our fixed income business as part of our cost reduction initiatives  as well as a decline in incentive compensation due to our lower revenues 
our average headcount was  in and  in our total headcount decreased from  employees as of december  to  employees including employees from island as of december  in addition  employees have also been given incentives through the issuance of stock options 
the company s policy is not to reflect an expense for stock options granted to employees 
soft dollar and commission recapture expense decreased from million in to million in this expense is offset dollar for dollar by soft dollar revenues and revenues that are subject to commission recapture 
this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our soft dollar costs due to lower volumes partly offset by expanded use of our commission recapture services offered by our lynch jones ryan subsidiary 
broker dealer rebates were million in as noted above  as part of our pricing incentives for broker dealers  we now offer commission rebates to broker dealers who provide liquidity  which is recorded as an expense  and charge commissions to broker dealers who consume liquidity  which is recorded as transaction fee revenue 
the commissions we charge to liquidity consumers more than offset the amount we pay to broker dealers who provide liquidity to our ecns 
brokerage  clearing and exchange fees increased from million in to million in this increase was due to higher brokerage and exchange fees as a result of our new order routing technology which allows us to route trades to other ecns  which in turn  charge us fees for this service  our acquisition of island and fees charged to our protrader subsidiary 
partly offsetting these increases were a reduction in our regulatory fees and lower us clearing costs as a result of implementing certain technology efficiencies  such as trade compression 
communications and equipment expense decreased from million in to million in this decrease was due in large part to lower core communications costs  which decreased from million in to million in  reflecting the benefit of improved network and systems efficiencies 
our equipment and software costs for upgrading our existing systems and other enhancements decreased from million in to million in primarily due to decreased spending in this area 
our exchange data access charges also decreased from million in to million  primarily due to the sale of our research and analytics product to reuters in september depreciation and amortization expense decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due a reduction in depreciation of our capitalizable assets  which decreased as part of our cost reduction initiatives  offsetting a slight increase due to our acquisition of island 
in addition  we ceased amortizing goodwill as a result of our adoption of sfas on january  offsetting this decrease in goodwill amortization was amortization related to our intangible assets  which we acquired in connection with our acquisition of island and protrader 
occupancy expense increased from million in to million in  primarily due to increased property insurance  maintenance and one time costs associated with our move to new corporate headquarters in new york and our acquisition of island 
partly offsetting these increases was a decrease in rent expense due to consolidation of our office space in the new york metropolitan area 
professional fees decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to reduced use of technical and management consultants  partly offset by an increase in our legal expenses and our acquisition of island 
marketing and business development decreased from million in to million in this decrease was due to a scaling back of our branding campaign as a result of our cost reduction initiatives 
other expenses increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in our provision for bad debts due to loans we made  payments to reuters in connection with the sale of our r a product in order to allow our customers to receive this service and support from reuters instead of us  and interest costs related to our securities lending and other clearing activities 
partly offsetting these increases were decreases in our travel expenses as part of our cost reduction initiatives  a one time refund of value added tax previously paid to certain non us tax authorities and interest expense related to a loan reuters provided to us to fund our acquisition of lynch jones ryan in february this loan was repaid in june provision for income taxes our tax provision on income loss from continuing operations decreased from a charge of million in to a benefit of million in as a result of our loss from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
our effective income tax rate decreased from in to in this decrease resulted from the permanent impairment of goodwill that was not deductible for tax purposes  restructuring charges  write down in our investments  operating losses in tax jurisdictions where utilization of tax losses is doubtful and other valuation allowances 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to goodwill  net of tax  was million in we adopted sfas on january  sfas requires that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead be reviewed for impairment 
impairment is deemed to exist when the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
this methodology differs from our previous policy  as permitted under accounting standards existing before sfas  of using undiscounted cash flows of the businesses acquired over its estimated life 
upon adoption of sfas  we incurred goodwill impairment before tax of million related to our acquisition of protrader and million related to our acquisition of montag popper partner gmbh  a fixed income broker dealer in germany 
decreased customer transaction volumes led to operating losses  closure of several trading offices and restructuring of our protrader subsidiary 
in addition  after a review of market conditions we determined our fixed income operations could not reach critical mass and therefore the carrying value of goodwill related to our acquisition of montag was impaired and written off 
december  versus december  overview net income decreased from million in to million in our revenues grew from billion in to billion in primarily as a result of increased us trading volumes in the first half of  notwithstanding the effects of the market closures from the events of september this growth offset a decline in our net transaction fee revenue earned from our customers trading non us equities primarily as a result of declines in share prices in non us securities markets despite our increased volumes in those markets 
our revenues from trading outside the united states are determined on the basis of the value of transactions  rather than the number of shares traded 
this revenue growth was offset by the increase in expenses from billion in to billion in this increase in expenses was primarily due to increased expenses related to our soft dollar and commission recapture businesses as a result of increased customer demand for this service  higher compensation and benefits expense and a restructuring charge related to our cost reduction initiatives  offset by a reduction in our professional fees and marketing and business development expenses 
expenses increased despite a decrease in our business development costs in connection with our efforts to expand and diversify our activities 
our expenses related to the creation of a retail brokerage capability decreased from million in to million in included in the and amounts are restructuring charges of million and million  respectively 
all charges related to our change in strategy related to our retail brokerage capability were incurred as of march  our loss from the discontinued operations of our fixed income business decreased from million in to million in revenues transaction fee revenue increased from billion in to billion in this increase was due to higher trading volumes primarily in the first half of both domestically and internationally  reflecting growth in trading volumes in the global securities markets 
our soft dollar revenues and our revenues that are subject to commission recapture  which are offset dollar for dollar by our soft dollar research payments and commission recapture expenses  increased from million in to million in primarily a result of increased customer demand for our soft dollar services as well as our purchase of lynch  jones ryan in february our transaction fee revenue earned from non us equities declined from million in to million in this amount represented of our total equity transaction fee revenue in  and in our net transaction fee revenue earned from non us equities a non gaap financial measurement  which excludes revenues directly related to soft dollar and commission recapture  declined from million in to million in this amount represented of our total net equity transaction fee revenue in  and in this decrease was primarily due to declines in share prices in non us securities markets despite our increased transaction volumes in those markets 
our revenues from trading outside the united states are determined on the basis of the value of transactions  rather than the number of shares traded 
our trading volumes in nasdaq quoted and us exchange listed stocks increased and  respectively  primarily in the first half of our share of volume in nasdaq quoted stocks increased from in to in  and our share of volume in us exchange listed stocks increased from in to in our average number of transactions in nasdaq quoted and us exchange listed stocks per day increased from  in to  in interest revenue increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to revenue generated by our clearing services  as well as interest from our fixed income investments and higher cash balances as a result of our initial public offering in may investment income increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to mark to market gains of million in shares we own in the euronext  london and hong kong stock exchanges as a result of their demutualizations  as well as unrealized gains of million on our fixed income investments 
partly offsetting these gains was a net write down of million related to our strategic alliances and long term investments 
we wrote up our investment in archipelago by a net amount of million due to the november merger announcement between archipelago and redibook and based on valuations of independent third parties involved in this transaction 
offsetting this gain was a net write down of million of our strategic alliances and long term investments in businesses which are in the area of capital raising  in particular wr hambrecht co 
and vencast 
in accordance with our accounting policy  we initially value investments at cost as a proxy for fair value and require that changes in value be established by meaningful third party transactions or a significant impairment in the issuer 
expenses compensation and benefits expense increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to higher salary costs partly offset by a decrease in our incentive compensation 
our headcount increased in as compared to the comparable period in  reaching  employees as of march   but then declining as of december  to  employees as part of our cost reduction initiatives  excluding the effect of our protrader acquisition in october and our discontinued fixed income business 
as of december   after giving effect to the protrader acquisition  our employee headcount was  our acquisition of protrader contributed to the increase in our compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of revenues from in to in soft dollar and commission recapture expense increased from million in to million in this expense is offset dollar for dollar by soft dollar revenues and revenues that are subject to commission recapture 
this increase was primarily due to our acquisition of lynch  jones ryan in february  as well as an increase in the overall use of our soft dollar services by our customers and increased market transaction volumes 
primarily as a result of our purchase of lynch  jones ryan  this expense increased as a percentage of our revenues from in to in brokerage  clearing and exchange fees increased from million in to million in this increase resulted from higher domestic and international brokerage and exchange fees as well as higher domestic clearing fees primarily due to an increase in the number of transactions 
partly offsetting this increase was a decrease in our international clearing fees due to lower rates charged by our clearing banks 
primarily as a result of higher brokerage and exchange fees  as a percent of revenue brokerage  clearing and exchange fees increased from in to in communications and equipment expense increased from million in to million in this increase was due in large part to higher costs related to our core communications  which increased from million in to million in of this amount  million related to network communications services that radianz began providing to us in june we outsourced these services and transferred employees to radianz at that time 
in addition  our office communication expense increased from million in to million in primarily due to the move to our new corporate headquarters 
partly offsetting these increases was a decrease in our equipment  hardware and software costs for upgrading our existing systems 
these costs decreased from million in to million in  reflecting the benefit of improved network and systems efficiencies 
our exchange data access charges also decreased primarily due to the sale of r a to reuters in the fourth quarter of primarily as a result of increased core communications costs  communications and equipment expense increased as a percentage of our revenues from in to in depreciation and amortization expense increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in depreciation as a result of our additional purchases of fixed assets and amortization of leasehold improvements  in connection with our move to our new corporate headquarters in new york 
as a percentage of our revenues  depreciation and amortization expense increased from in to in occupancy expense increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to higher lease payments and related expenses for our new corporate headquarters in new york 
professional fees decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to reduced use of technical and management consultants as a result of our cost reduction initiatives  as well as reduced legal expenses 
these fees were higher in as we were preparing for our reorganization and initial public offering 
a total of million of the decrease in professional fees was attributable to reduced use of consultants for the creation of a retail brokerage capability and for our fixed income business 
professional fees decreased as a percentage of our revenues from in to in marketing and business development expense decreased from million in to million in this decrease was due primarily to a decreased level of advertising as a result of our cost reduction initiatives as well as the change in strategy related to our retail brokerage capability 
other expenses increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to our interest costs related to our securities lending activities  allowance for doubtful accounts  payments to reuters in connection with our sale of our r a product in order to allow customers to continue to receive this service and support from reuters instead of us  and our charitable donations and other costs associated with the events of september partly offsetting this increase was a decrease in our travel costs as a result of our cost reduction initiatives 
loss of fixed assets at world trade center and recovery of fixed assets lost relates to losses of million we incurred in our offices at the world trade center as a result of the events of september we recovered million from our insurance carrier 
provision for income taxes our tax provision decreased from million in to million in our effective income tax rate decreased from in to in the reduction in the rate for is primarily due to lower state and local income taxes

our expense structure includes a certain level of fixed costs  as well as a variable cost base that fluctuates with customer transaction volumes 
in addition  we incur certain costs in anticipation of certain transaction volume levels 
if demand for our brokerage services should decline suddenly as has occurred in the past and we may be unable to adjust our fixed cost base on a timely basis  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  we may continue to make significant expenditures related to technological innovations over long periods of time  so that our operating margins and profitability could be adversely affected 
due to all of the foregoing factors  period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve the rates of revenue growth that we have experienced in the past  that we will be able to improve our operating results or that we will be able to achieve profitability on a quarterly basis 
see certain factors that may affect our business 
liquidity and capital resources we finance our business primarily through cash generated by our operating activities 
in addition  we have access to a number of credit facilities  although our borrowings under these facilities have been traditionally low 
our financial liquidity is primarily determined by the performance of our business and partly by the return on our investments 
we maintain a highly liquid balance sheet that can fluctuate significantly between financial statement dates 
our cash equivalents and securities owned are primarily comprised of highly liquid investments that can be sold in the secondary market  if necessary 
we currently anticipate that our existing cash resources and credit facilities  will be more than sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital  capital expenditures and regulatory capital requirements  operating losses  restructuring charges as well as other anticipated requirements for at least the next twelve months 
to the extent that overall market volumes and our trading volumes decrease beyond certain levels  we may be required to obtain additional financing from third parties or reuters 
we received net proceeds of million during our initial public offering in we used million of these proceeds to repay our indebtedness to reuters  million in connection with our acquisition of protrader in october and used the remaining proceeds to pay a portion of a special dividend of million in connection with our acquisition of island in september cash and cash equivalents  together with assets readily convertible into cash  accounted for  and of our assets as of december   and  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents decreased to million as of december  from million as of december   primarily due to our dividend payment of million in connection with our acquisition of island  decreases in our securities owned and purchases of fixed assets and leasehold improvements 
decreases in our payables to broker dealers and payables to customers and increases in securities borrowed were partly offset by a decrease in our receivables from broker dealers 
cash and cash equivalents increased to million as of december  from million as of december  primarily due to the million of net proceeds we received from our initial public offering in may  as well as increases in our securities loaned 
this increase was offset in part by an increase in our securities segregated under federal regulations and securities borrowed 
the increase in our securities borrowed and loaned  as well as securities segregated under federal regulations relates to our clearing business 
assets readily convertible into cash consist primarily of the following components as set forth on our statement of financial condition receivables from broker dealers principally represent amounts due on securities transactions that have not been completed as of the settlement date 
the settlement date generally occurs within three business days of the trade date for us securities transactions  but can take as long as days for non us equity transactions 
receivables from customers principally represent customer debit balances and amounts due on securities transactions that have not been completed as of the settlement date 
commissions receivable represent commissions transaction fees principally from broker dealers 
securities owned consist principally of us government and agency securities  municipal bonds and corporate bonds in which we invest our excess cash 
for the purpose of this calculation  we have excluded the shares we own in various stock exchanges 
securities borrowed represent the amount of collateral deposited with brokers securing marketable equity securities borrowed by us in connection with covering customer securities transactions in our clearing business 
changes in our total assets and liabilities  in particular  receivable from broker dealers and customers  securities borrowed  and commissions receivable and payable to broker dealers and customers  generally lead to large fluctuations in our cash flows from operating activities from period to period and within periods 
capital expenditures in  and related to the purchase of data processing and communications equipment  leasehold improvements and purchases of furniture for our additional office facilities 
we incurred losses of approximately million in related to fixed assets at our offices in the world trade center  as a result of the events of september we recovered million in from our insurance carrier 
capital expenditures and investments in new technology were financed primarily through income from operations 
additionally  we made cash payments or acquired cash in excess of net assets of in in connection with our acquisition of island and protrader  million in october and million in january in connection with our acquisition of protrader and million in february in connection with our acquisition of lynch  jones ryan 
historically  acquisitions of new businesses had generally been funded through subordinated borrowings from reuters 
since our initial public offering  acquisitions have generally been funded from the proceeds from our initial public offering  cash generated by our operations or through issuance of our common stock 
we also repurchased million of our common stock in to satisfy future conversions of restricted stock units into common stock under our restricted stock unit plan 
we received million related to the issuance of our common stock to satisfy options exercised during lastly  we paid a million special dividend in in connection with our acquisition of island 
our future cash payments associated with contractual obligations  which are primarily leases for office space and equipment under non cancelable operating leases with third parties and reuters  are summarized as follows year ending december  million year ending december  million year ending december  million year ending december  million year ending december  million thereafter million our aggregate minimum lease commitments after relate to our year lease for our headquarters in new york 
we anticipate that we will meet our capital expenditure needs out of operating cash flows 
cash provided by used in financing activities totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
as noted above  we made a million dividend payment 
in may  we made a return of capital of million to reuters 
we funded that return of capital through an intercompany advance from reuters 
we repaid that advance in may out of the net proceeds we received from our initial public offering 
in addition  reuters loaned us million to fund our acquisition of lynch  jones ryan in february this loan bore interest at an annual rate based on six month libor plus and was repaid in june as of december   we had access to million of uncommitted credit lines from commercial banking institutions to meet the funding needs of our us operations 
these credit lines are collateralized by a combination of customer securities and our marketable securities 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under these credit lines 
we currently pay no annual fees to maintain these facilities 
in addition  as of december   we had access to million of uncommitted credit lines from commercial banking institutions to meet the funding needs of our european and asian subsidiaries 
these credit lines are uncollateralized  and we currently pay no annual fees to maintain these facilities 
as of december   there was million outstanding under these credit lines 
prior to our initial public offering  reuters had issued non binding  short term letters to certain of these institutions confirming its ownership of us and indicating that if we were to default under the relevant facility  reuters would consider  without any obligation  requests by these institutions for compensation 
reuters has withdrawn these letters and advised us that it will not issue any additional letters 
our broker dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements intended to ensure their respective general financial soundness and liquidity  which require that they comply with certain minimum capital requirements 
these regulations  which differ in each country  generally prohibit a broker dealer subsidiary from repaying borrowings from us or our affiliates  paying cash dividends  making loans to us or our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that would result in a significant reduction in its regulatory net capital position without prior notification or approval of its principal regulator 
our capital structure is designed to provide each of our subsidiaries with capital and liquidity consistent with its business and regulatory requirements 
as of december   our us registered broker dealer subsidiary instinet clearing services  inc  which is the counterparty to each of our customer transactions in us securities executed through our subsidiary instinet corporation but not the island ecn  which cleared its securities transactions through another broker dealer until january   after which point it began clearing its transactions through ics  had net capital of million  which was million in excess of its required net capital of million 
we have an active securities borrowing and lending business  where we borrow securities from one party and lend them to another  as well as to facilitate the settlement process to meet our customers needs 
under these transactions  we either receive or provide collateral  generally cash 
when we borrow securities  we provide cash to the lenders as collateral and earn interest on the cash 
similarly  when we loan securities  we receive cash as collateral and pay interest to the borrower 
the initial collateral advanced or received approximates  or is greater than  fair value of the securities borrowed or loaned 
in the event the counterparty is unable to meet its contractual obligations to return the pledged collateral  we may be exposed to the market risk of acquiring the collateral at prevailing market prices 
we provided million and million as collateral for securities borrowed as of december  and  respectively 
we also received million and million as collateral for securities loaned as of december  and  respectively 
included in commissions and other receivables is approximately million from archipelago llc  b trade services llc and redibook ecn llcc of which we have commenced arbitration proceedings before the nasd for approximately million 
we have established an appropriate reserve against the disputed amount based upon a review of the facts and circumstances surrounding the dispute 
in connection with our correspondent clearing business  we are required to maintain segregated funds in a special reserve bank account for the exclusive benefit of our customers 
as of december   these funds amounted to million 
in addition  so long as reuters owns a majority of our common stock  we will need reuters consent to incur net indebtedness indebtedness for borrowed money less cash on hand in excess of an aggregate of million and any indebtedness incurred by us in the ordinary course of our brokerage or similar business or in connection with the clearance of securities or obligations to securities exchanges or clearing systems 
we cannot assure you that we will receive reuters consent to incur indebtedness above this amount in the future if we need to do so for any reason

sfas no requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred

management does not believe adoption of this statement will have a material impact upon our financial condition and results of operations

in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the company s policy is not to expense stock options  therefore  management does not believe adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations

the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for periods ending after december  management is reviewing the potential impact of adoption of this statement on its financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument that might result from fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
we have established policies  procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks in the normal course of our business operations 
interest rate risk we invest a portion of our available cash in marketable securities  classified as securities owned in our consolidated statements of financial condition  to maximize yields while continuing to meet our cash and liquidity needs and the net capital requirements of our regulated subsidiaries 
we maintain a short term investment portfolio of securities consisting of the following december  us government and federal agency us municipal bonds corporate bonds foreign sovereign obligations total these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if interest rates increase 
if interest rates had increased immediately and uniformly by basis points  or basis points in the case of municipal bonds  as of december  and  the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by million and million  respectively 
we generally hold these securities until maturity and therefore would not expect our financial condition  operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in interest rates 
in addition  as a part of our brokerage business  we invest portions of our excess cash in short term interest earning assets mainly cash and money market instruments  which totaled and million as of december  and  respectively 
we also had short term borrowings of and million as of december  and  respectively  on which we are generally charged rates that approximate the us federal funds rate or the local equivalent rate 
as a result  we do not anticipate that changes in interest rates will have a material impact on our financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
exchange rate risk a portion of our operations consists of brokerage services provided outside of the united states 
therefore  our results of operations could be adversely affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations 
we are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates on the british pound and the euro 
when the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the us dollar value of non us dollar based revenues decreases 
when the non us dollar weakens against these currencies  the us dollar value of us dollar based revenues increases 
correspondingly  the us dollar value of us dollar based costs increases when the us dollar weakens and decreases when the us dollar strengthens 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates may affect our results 
however  we do not believe that our exchange rate exposure will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  therefore  we have not hedged this exposure 
in the future  we may enter into derivative financial instruments as a means of hedging this risk 
we manage currency exposure related to our brokerage business on a geographic basis 
we generally match each of the non us subsidiary s liabilities with assets denominated in the same local currency and manage each subsidiary s balance sheet in local currency 
this generally results in the net equity of the subsidiary being reported in its functional currency and subject to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates when translated into the us dollar  our reporting currency 
we currently do not seek to mitigate this exchange rate exposure  but we may in the future 
we may enter into forward foreign currency contracts to facilitate our customers settling transactions in various currencies  primarily the us dollar  british pound or euro 
these forward foreign currency contracts are with third parties and with terms generally identical to our customers transactions 
because our customers transactions are matched to the forward foreign exchange contract  our exposure to exchange rate risk is not material 
the following is a breakdown of the currency denominations of our securities owned in millions december  currency british pound euros japanese yen canadian dollar hong kong dollar total our resulting exposure to exchange rate risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates due to functional versus reporting currency exposure and was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
a portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in non us dollar currencies 
approximately of our revenues and of our expenses as of december  and of our revenues and of our expenses as of december  were so denominated 
our profits are therefore exposed to foreign currency risk not a loss of funds but rather a loss for financial reporting purposes 
we estimate this risk as the potential loss in revenue resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates on the mix in our profits between our functional currency and the respective reporting currencies of our subsidiaries 
on this basis  the estimated risk was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively

however  we own marketable securities of the london  hong kong and euronext stock exchanges as a result of their demutualizations  which exposes us to market price risk 
this risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted market prices and amounted to approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
credit risks we are exposed to substantial credit risk from both parties to a securities transaction during the period between the transaction date and the settlement date 
this period is three business days in the us equities markets and can be as much as days in some international markets 
in addition  we have credit exposure that extends beyond the settlement date in the case of a party that does not settle in a timely manner by failing either to make payment or to deliver securities 
we hold the securities that are the subject of the transaction as collateral for our customer receivables 
adverse movements in the prices of these securities can increase our credit risk 
over the last three years  our loss from transactions in which a party refused or was unable to settle and other credit losses have been immaterial 
we are also exposed to credit risks from third parties that owe us money  securities or other obligations 
these parties include our customers  trading counterparties clearing agents  exchanges and other financial institutions

s and non us government and agency obligations  as well as corporate and municipal bonds 
for investments maturing within six months  our credit policy is that all investments have at least an a p credit rating from standard poors and moody s investors service
