item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were organized in as a unit of celanese corporation  a chemical company 
our initial mandate was to apply biotechnology to the production of fine and specialty chemicals 
following the merger of celanese corporation with american hoechst corporation  we were spun off as an independent biopharmaceutical company 
in july  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock and commenced the research and development of chemical and biotreatment processes for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries 
we discontinued the biotreatment operations in to focus on our targeted small molecule cancer and immunology compound development programs and our biocatalytic chiral chemistry program 
between and  our revenue was generated primarily through the development and supply of chirally pure intermediates to pharmaceutical companies for use in new drug development and  to a lesser degree  from agrochemical research and development contracts 
however  as revenue from thalomid reg 
tm sales  license agreements and milestone payments related to our cancer and immunology programs increased  sales of chirally pure intermediates became a less integral part of our strategic focus 
accordingly  on january   we completed the sale of our chiral intermediates business to cambrex corporation for million 
terms of the sale provided for a payment to celgene of million at closing and future royalties on product sales not to exceed the net present value on the initial date of the sale of million  with a guarantee of certain minimum payments to celgene beginning in the third year following the close of the agreement 
in july  we received approval from the fda to market thalomid reg 
tm thalidomide for use in enl  a side effect of leprosy  and  in late september  we commenced sales of thalomid reg 
tm in the united states 
sales have grown rapidly each year since the launch and  in  we recorded net sales of thalomid reg 
tm of million 
on february   we completed a follow on public offering to sell  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  as adjusted for a three for one stock split effective april  shares were for our account and  were for the account of a selling shareholder pursuant to the conversion of  of the  january convertible notes held by that shareholder 
our proceeds  net of offering expenses  were approximately million 
on april   we signed a license and development agreement with novartis pharma ag in which we granted to novartis a license for d mph  our chirally pure version of ritalin reg 
tm 
the agreement provides for significant upfront and milestone payments based on achieving various regulatory approvals and royalties on the entire family of ritalin reg 
tm products upon approval of d mph by the fda 
we have retained the rights for the use of d mph in oncology indications 
we received approval from the fda to market d mph  or focalin tm  on november  on august   we completed a merger  accounted for as a pooling of interests  with signal pharmaceuticals  inc  a privately held biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of drugs that regulate genes associated with disease 
on december   we completed a merger  accounted for under the purchase method  with anthrogenesis corp  a privately held biotherapeutics company pioneering the recovery of stem cells from human placental tissue following the completion of a full term  successful pregnancy 
we have sustained losses in each year since our inception as an independent biopharmaceutical company in in  we had a net loss of million  including one time charges primarily as a result of acquired in process r d related to the anthrogenesis acquisition and a patent litigation settlement 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to make substantial expenditures to further develop and commercialize thalomid reg 
tm  develop our other oncology and immunological disease programs  further develop and commercialize our stem cell recovery efforts and advance our gene regulation and target discovery program 
these expenditures are expected to be more than offset by increasing product sales  royalties  revenues from various research collaborations and license agreements with other pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies  and investment income 
subject to the risks described elsewhere in this annual report on form k under risk factors  we believe there are significant market opportunities for the pharmaceutical products and processes under development by us 
to address these and potential future opportunities in a timely and competitive manner  we intend to seek out drug discovery and development collaborations and licensing arrangements with third parties 
we have entered into agreements covering the manufacture and distribution for us of certain compounds  such as thalomid reg 
tm and focalin tm  and the development by us of processes for producing chirally pure crop protection agents for license to agrochemical manufacturers 
the latter development activities are performed through celgro corporation  our wholly owned agrochemical subsidiary 
we have established a commercial sales  marketing and customer service organization to sell and support our products  and as of march   we employ approximately persons in this capacity 
we intend to develop and market our own pharmaceuticals for indications with economically accessible patient populations in our disease franchises 
for drugs with indications outside the oncology and immunological disease fields and for larger patient populations  we may partner with other pharmaceutical companies 
we currently partner with other companies for the development and commercialization of our chirally pure pharmaceutical and agrochemical products 
we expect these arrangements typically will include some combination of license fees  milestone payments  reimbursement of research and development expenses and royalty arrangements 
we also may acquire products or companies to expand our product portfolio and to augment our development and commercialization resources 
future operating results will depend on many factors  including demand for our products  regulatory approvals of our products  the timing of the introduction and market acceptance of new products by us or competing companies  the timing of research and development milestones and our ability to control costs 
results of operations fiscal years ended december   and total revenue 
our total revenue for the year ended december  increased to million compared with million for the same period in total revenue in consisted of product sales of million  of which million were thalomid reg 
tm sales and million were sales of focalin tm  which received fda approval in november  and research contract revenue of million compared with product sales of million  of which million were thalomid reg 
tm sales and million were sales of focalin tm  research contract revenue of million and related party revenue of million in thalomid reg 
tm sales continue to grow in oncology as more clinical data is presented either in publications or at oncology meetings 
research contract revenue and royalty income in  which decreased from  included approximately million of amortization of an upfront payment related to an agreement with novartis and million in royalty income from novartis on sales of their ritalin reg 
tm family of products 
there was no related party revenue in as the initial terms of both related party agreements expired in and such entities are no longer considered related parties 
our total revenue for the year ended december  increased to million compared with million for the same period in total revenue in consisted of product sales of million  of which million were thalomid reg 
tm sales and million were sales of focalin tm  research contract revenue of million and related party revenue of million compared with product sales in of million  all of which were thalomid reg 
tm sales  research contract revenue of million and related party revenue of million in research contract revenue in  which increased from  included approximately million of amortization of upfront payments related to two separate agreements with novartis and a milestone payment of million from novartis for receiving fda approval to market focalin tm 
research contract revenue in consisted primarily of recognition of million of the million nonrefundable upfront license fee payment received in connection with a collaborative agreement entered into with novartis in april  and a million milestone payment related to the same agreement with novartis 
related party revenue decreased in from as the initial terms of both related party agreements expired and such entities are no longer considered related parties 
one of those agreements was extended and approximately million was classified as research contract revenue in cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold in increased approximately to million  or of product sales  from approximately million  or of product sales  in this increase was primarily related to the significant increase in thalomid reg 
tm sales 
additionally  expenses related to product royalties on thalomid reg 
tm sales increased due to larger royalty percentages as higher sales thresholds were met 
cost of goods sold for relating to focalin tm sales continued to be favorably impacted as manufacturing costs incurred prior to focalin s tm approval in november were expensed as research and development expenses 
this favorability will continue until the quantity previously expensed is completely sold 
cost of goods sold in increased approximately to million  or of product sales  from approximately million  or of product sales  in  in line with the increase in product sales and therefore primarily volume related 
cost of goods sold for relating to focalin tm sales was favorably impacted as manufacturing costs incurred prior to focalin s tm approval in november were expensed as research and development expenses 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  contractor fees  principally with contract research organizations to assist in our clinical development programs  clinical drug supplies for our clinical and preclinical programs as well as other consumable research supplies  and allocated facilities charges such as building rent and utilities 
research and development expenses in increased to million from million in approximately million in was spent on thalomid reg 
tm and its follow on compounds  the imids tm and selcids tm  primarily for preclinical toxicology and phase i ii clinical trials  the initiation of our phase iii clinical trials in multiple myeloma and metastatic melanoma and legal expenses related to patent filings 
we spent approximately million in our gene regulation  target discovery and agro chemical programs  primarily for internal headcount related expenses  laboratory supplies and product development costs 
research and development expenses in increased to million from million in approximately million was spent on thalomid reg 
tm and its follow on compounds  the imids tm and selcids tm  primarily for preclinical toxicology and phase i ii clinical trials  regulatory expenses for preparation of a supplementary new drug application  or snda  for thalomid reg 
tm in multiple myeloma and legal expenses related to patent filings 
approximately million was spent for focalin tm  primarily for drug supply that was expensed prior to fda approval 
we spent approximately million in our gene regulation  target discovery and agro chemical programs  primarily for internal headcount related expenses  laboratory supplies and product development costs 
as a percent of total revenue  research and development expenses were approximately  and in  and  respectively 
reference the table on page of part i business section for the status of specific compounds 
in general  estimated time to completion within the various stages of clinical development are as follows estimated completion clinical phase period phase i years phase ii years phase iii years due to the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in preclinical tests and clinical trials associated with each of our research and development projects  the cost to complete such projects is not reasonably estimable 
the data obtained from these tests and trials may be susceptible to varying interpretation that could delay  limit or prevent a project s advancement through the various stages of clinical development  which would significantly impact the costs incurred in bringing a project to completion 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling expenses consist of salaries and benefits for sales and marketing and customer service personnel  warehousing and distribution costs  and other commercial expenses to support the sales force and the education and registration efforts underlying the steps reg 
tm program 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  outside services for legal  audit  tax and investor activities and allocations of facilities costs  principally for rent  utilities and property taxes 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in to million from million in the increased spending was primarily commercial expenses to support the commercialization of thalomid reg 
tm  with approximately a million increase in sales and marketing expenses primarily related to the sales force expansion 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in to million from million in similar to  the increased spending in was primarily commercial expenses to support the commercialization of thalomid reg 
tm  with approximately a million increase in sales and marketing expenses primarily related to the sales force expansion and an increase of million in customer service and warehousing and distribution  primarily related to bringing the previously out sourced customer service function in house and a rollout of an enhanced steps reg 
tm program 
as a percent of total revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately  and in  and  respectively 
litigation settlement and related agreements 
on december   we entered into a series of agreements with entremed  inc and children s medical center corporation to effectively terminate ongoing litigation relating to patents for thalidomide analogs and to grant an exclusive license to us for the rights to those patents 
under the terms of an asset purchase agreement  we paid to entremed  for all thalidomide analog patents and associated clinical data and records  and the termination of any litigation surrounding those patents 
under the terms of a securities purchase agreement  we acquired from entremed  shares of series a convertible preferred stock  and warrants for an additional  common shares for  the series a convertible preferred stock is convertible  at our option  into an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of per share provided  however  that the conversion price in effect from time to time shall be subject to certain adjustments 
dividends will accrue at per annum on these preferred stock 
we shall have the right to one vote for each share of common stock into which such share of series a convertible preferred stock could then be converted  and with respect to such vote  we shall have full voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of shares of common stock 
the warrants have an exercise price of per share  vest after six months from the date of grant and expire after seven years from the date of grant 
the company completed an assessment of the estimated realizable value of the investment 
considering the level of the company s ownership interest in entremed  its history of operating losses and the fact that entremed is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company engaged primarily in research and development activities with proposed products and research programs in the early stage of clinical development  and  based on such assessment  the entire amount of such preferred stock was written down 
we also signed an exclusive license agreement with cmcc that terminated any existing thalidomide analog agreements between cmcc and entremed and directly granted us an exclusive worldwide license for the analog patents 
we paid to cmcc  under this agreement with another  payable between and  the present value relating to which aggregating  was charged to earnings 
additonally  we entered into a five year sponsored research agreement with cmcc whereby we have committed  per year in funding 
additional payments are possible under the agreement depending on the successful development and commercialization of thalidomide analogs 
we recorded a charge to earnings for the cost of these agreements and related expenses of  in including the write down of the entremed series a convertible preferred stock and certain legal expenses incurred in connection with the settlement 
acquired in process research and development on december   we completed the acquisition of anthrogenesis corp 
for an aggregate purchase price of million see note 
anthrogenesis is an early stage biotherapeutics company delivering stem cell therapies produced from renewable human placental sources materials 
we acquired anthrogenesis to realize the substantial therapeutic and commercial potential of placental stem cells through its commercial and developmental infrastructure 
the acquisition of anthrogenesis was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations 
approximately million of the total purchase consideration of million was allocated to ipr d  which was charged to expense at the acquisition date 
in  we do not expect the acquisition of anthrogenesis to significantly impact the overall level of research and development expenses  or materially change our current product sales mix 
merger related costs 
we incurred one time costs of million related to the merger with signal pharmaceuticals  inc in these costs were primarily related to fees for financial advisors  accountants  lawyers and financial printers 
interest and other income and interest expense 
interest and other income increased approximately in to million from million in the increase was primarily related to higher realized gains of approximately million on sales of certain marketable securities offset by lower interest income on lower average cash balances and lower yields on our securities during interest and other income increased approximately in to million from million in the increase was primarily related to higher average cash balances and the recognition of a gain on the sale of certain marketable securities during interest expense decreased to approximately  in compared with approximately  in the decrease was primarily related to exercising the purchase options on the majority of our leased equipment during interest expense decreased to approximately  in compared with million in the decrease was primarily related to an agreement with the convertible note holders to eliminate the interest requirements in exchange for the right to hedge the shares underlying the convertible notes 
loss from continuing operations 
the loss from continuing operations increased significantly in to million from million in the increased loss resulted from the acquisition of anthrogenesis  whereby we incurred a charge of million for in process research and development costs  the litigation settlement and related agreements with entremed  inc and cmcc which resulted in a charge of million  an increase of million in other operating costs and expenses as explained above under cost of goods sold  research and development expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses and a decrease of million in the net income tax benefit  partially offset by an increase in total revenue of million as explained above under total revenues and an increase in net interest and other income and expense of million as explained above under interest and other income and expense 
the loss from continuing operations decreased significantly in  to million from million in the decreased loss resulted from an increase in total revenue of million as explained above under total revenues and an increase in net interest and other income and expense of million as explained above under interest and other income and expense  partially offset by an increase in costs and expenses of million as explained above under cost of goods sold  research and development expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses 
gain on sale of chiral assets 
we received royalty payments from cambrex corporation of approximately million   and  in  and  respectively  which represent additional portions of the purchase price paid by cambrex for our chiral assets 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our working capital requirements primarily through product sales  private and public sales of our debt and equity securities  income earned on the investment of proceeds from the sale of such securities and revenue from research contracts and license and milestone payments 
since our initial product launch in the third quarter of  we have recorded net product sales totaling approximately million through december  our working capital at december  decreased approximately to million from million in the decrease in working capital was primarily due to a lower combination of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher current liablilities 
cash and cash equivalents increased to million in from million in while investments in marketable debt securities decreased to million in from million in total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased by approximately million reflecting increased spending for both commercial and research and development activities and the litigation settlement and related agreements with entremed and cmcc  partially offset by the receipt of funds from revenue received from research contracts and collection of receivables from sales of thalomid reg 
tm 
we expect that our rate of spending will increase as the result of research and product development spending  increased clinical trial costs  increased expenses associated with the regulatory approval process and commercialization of products currently in development  increased costs related to the commercialization of thalomid reg 
tm and increased capital investments 
on february   we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock  as adjusted for a three for one stock split effective april proceeds from the transaction  net of expenses  were approximately million 
these funds  combined with the increasing revenue from product sales and various research agreements and collaborations  are expected to provide sufficient capital for our operations for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations our major outstanding contractual obligations relate to our operating facilities leases 
we lease a  square foot laboratory and office facility in warren  new jersey  under a lease with an unaffiliated party  which has a term ending in may with two five year renewal options  a  square foot facility which has a term ending in july with two five year renewal options  and an  square foot facility with a term ending in monthly rental expenses for these facilities are approximately  we also lease an  square foot laboratory and office facility in north brunswick  new jersey  under a lease with an unaffiliated party that has a term ending in december with two five year renewal options 
monthly rental expenses for this facility are approximately  in december  we entered into another lease to consolidate our san diego operations into one building 
the  square foot laboratory and office facility in san diego  california was leased from an unaffiliated party and has a term ending in august monthly rental expenses for this facility are approximately  the three leases for the  square feet of san diego laboratory and office space recently vacated by us are coterminous and end in december under the leases  we reimburse the landlord for taxes  insurance and operating costs associated with the properties and have an outstanding letter of credit for  in favor of the landlord that is fully collateralized by cash 
upon transferring our operations to the new facility  the lease obligations and remaining unamortized leasehold improvements for the vacated properties were taken as a charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of upon completion of the acquisition of anthrogenesis on december   we assumed separate leases in the existing facility for office and laboratory space in cedar knolls  new jersey 
the leases are for a combined space of approximately  square feet with a monthly rental expense of approximately  both leases have original five year terms with one expiring in and one expiring in with a five year renewal option 
in november of  anthrogenesis entered into a lease for an additional  square feet of laboratory space in baton rouge  louisiana 
the lease has a five year term with a three year renewel option 
monthly rental expense for this facility is approximately  for a schedule of payments related to the operating leases  refer to the table included in footnote a to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants discuss their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we believe the following accounting policy to be critical revenue recognition 
we have formed collaborative research and development agreements and alliances with several pharmaceutical companies 
these agreements are in the form of research and development and license agreements 
the agreements are for both early and late stage compounds and are focused on specific disease areas 
for the early stage compounds  the agreements are relatively short term agreements that are renewable depending on the success of the compounds as they move through preclinical development 
the agreements call for nonrefundable upfront payments  milestone payments on achieving significant milestone events  and in some cases ongoing research funding 
the agreements also contemplate royalty payments on sales if and when the compound receives fda marketing approval 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
sab revenue recognition in financial statements  upfront payments are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the estimated service period 
if the estimated service period is subsequently modified  the period over which the upfront fee is recognized is modified accordingly on a prospective basis 
revenue from the achievement of research and development milestones  which represent the achievement of a significant step in the research and development process  are recognized when and if the specific milestones are achieved 
continuation of certain contracts is dependent upon our achieving specific contractual milestones  however  none of the payments received to date are refundable regardless of the outcome of the project 
research funding is recorded in the period during which the expenses covered by the funding occurred 
acquired in process research and development ipr d 
ipr d represents that portion of the purchase price of the anthrogenesis acquisition that relates to the research and development activities  which are yet to demonstrate their technological feasibility and have no alternative future use 
the estimated fair value of these projects is determined by employment of a discounted cash flow model 
the discount rates used take into account the stage of completion and the risks surrounding the successful development and commercialization of each of the purchased in process technology projects that were valued 
the analysis included forecasted future cash flows that are expected to result from the progress made on the in process project prior to the purchase dates 
appropriate operating expenses are deducted from the total forecasted net revenues to establish a forecast of net returns on the completed portion of the in process technology 
finally  these net returns are discounted to a present value using discount rates that incorporate the weighted average cost of capital relative to the biotech industry and the company as well as product specific risks associated with the purchased in process research and development products 
the product specific risk factors include the product s phase of development  likelihood of success  manufacturing process capability  scientific rationale  pre clinical safety and efficacy data  target product profile  and development plan and takes into consideration an overall discount rate  which represents a risk premium to the company s weighted average cost of capital for purchase valuation purposes 
the forecast data in the analysis is based on internal product level forecast information maintained by management in the ordinary course of managing the business 
the inputs used by management in analyzing ipr d is based on assumptions  which management believes to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
these assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and no assurance can be given that unanticipated events and circumstances will not occur 
the valuations used to estimate ipr d require us to use significant estimates and assumptions  that if changed  may result in a different valuation for ipr d 
valuations for the anthrogenesis acquisition was completed by an independent third party consulting firm in accordance with sec guidelines
