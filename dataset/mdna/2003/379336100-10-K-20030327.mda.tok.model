operating risks include hazards such as vessel capsizing  sinking  grounding  colliding  and sustaining damage in severe weather conditions  fire and explosion 
these hazards can also cause personal injury  loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment  pollution and environmental damage  and suspension of operations 
the risks inherent with international operations include political  social  and economic instability  exchange rate fluctuations  currency restrictions  nullification  modification  or renegotiations of contracts  potential vessel seizure  nationalization of assets  import export quotas  and other forms of public and governmental regulation 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results and outcomes may differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements 
in the fourth quarter of  management reviewed the company s management structure and effective january  reorganized its operating management structure and its existing business lines  offshore construction and installation and diving  to focus on core operations and specialized markets 
these changes were made to adapt to certain marketplace conditions in the company s domestic and international operations 
in conjunction with the reorganization  the company will eliminate non core and under performing assets relating to certain of its marine assets and support facilities 
the company recorded a one time pretax non cash charge of million in december associated with these assets 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenues 
year ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross profit goodwill amortization losses on asset disposal and impairment selling  general and administrative expenses operating loss income interest expense other income loss income before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes loss income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principal cumulative effect of change in accounting principal net loss income our results of operations reflect the level of offshore construction activity in the gulf of mexico and all international locations  for all periods presented above 
the results also reflect our ability to win jobs through competitive bidding and manage awarded jobs to successful completion 
the level of offshore construction activity is principally determined by three factors first  the oil and gas industry s ability to economically justify placing discoveries of oil and gas reserves in production  second  the oil and gas industry s need to clear all structures from the lease once the oil and gas reserves have been depleted  and third  weather events such as major hurricanes 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  of million were higher than revenues for the year ended december  of million 
the increase in revenues resulted primarily from increased activity in certain areas including west africa and latin america  partially offset by a decrease in activity in the gulf of mexico offshore construction  gulf of mexico diving  and asia pacific segments and decreased activity and lower pricing in the gulf of mexico marine support segment 
gross profit 
for the year ended december   we had gross profit of million compared with million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of decreased activity and or pricing in our gulf of mexico offshore construction  gulf of mexico diving  gulf of mexico marine support segments  a lower margin on a large epic contract in our west africa segment and lower than expected productivity associated with three other projects  partially offset by increased activity in our latin america segment and a different mix of contract work in our asia pacific segment 
as a percentage of revenues  gross profit for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  losses on asset disposal and impairment

depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization  including amortization of drydocking costs  for the year ended december  was million compared to the million recorded in the year ended december  the increase was principally attributable to increased utilization of the company s pipelay derrick barges  which are depreciated on a units of production basis  in latin america  gulf of mexico offshore construction  asia pacific  and west africa segments 
the increase was partially offset by the cessation of goodwill amortization  beginning january   in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
amortization of goodwill for the year ended december  was million 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is attributable to lower interest rates and lower average outstanding debt levels 
other income

net loss income 
for the year ended december   we recorded a net loss of million  compared to net income of million for the year ended december  our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the reduction in the effective tax rate is due primarily to the one time non cash charge that the company recorded in and its effects on taxable income in differing taxable jurisdictions

segment information 
the company has identified seven reportable segments as required by sfas see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discusses the results of operations for each of those reportable segments 
gulf of mexico offshore construction revenues increased to million including million intersegment revenues for the year ended december  from million including million intersegment revenues for the year ended december  income loss before taxes improved million  to a loss of million for the year ended december  compared to a loss before taxes of million for the comparable period last year 
the increase in revenues and improved income before tax was primarily attributable to increased demand for offshore services in the gulf of mexico 
although activity increased considerably during  sales volume at current margin levels was insufficient to cover certain fixed costs resulting in a loss before tax 
gulf of mexico diving revenues from diving related services in the gulf of mexico increased to million including million intersegment revenues for the year ended december  compared to million including million intersegment revenues for the year ended december  due to increased activity in higher margin saturation diving work 
the increased activity resulted in income before taxes of million for the year ended december  compared to income before taxes of million for the year ended december  gulf of mexico marine support revenues for this segment increased to million including million intersegment revenues for the year ended december   compared to million including million intersegment revenues for the year ended december  approximately and of the revenue increase was due to increase activity and improved pricing  respectively 
as a result of the overall increase in activity levels and improved pricing  income before taxes also increased to million during the year ended december  compared to income before taxes of million for the year ended december  west africa for the year ended december   revenues decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the decline in revenues was due primarily to the completion of one large contract during which had a large portion of fabrication and procurement content 
income before taxes increased to million for the year ended december  from a loss of million for the year ended december  earnings increased despite the decline in revenues  due to changes in the mix of contract work 
latin america revenues increased slightly to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  income before taxes increased to million for the year ended december  from a nominal profit for the same period in during the fourth quarter of  the company settled a prior year contract dispute resulting in a favorable settlement of approximately million  which is included in the latin america segment s income before tax 
exclusive of the aforementioned settlement gain  earnings declined to a loss despite the comparable revenue levels  due to changes in the mix of contract work 
asia pacific revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the significant improvement in revenues was the result of increased activity in the region 
results improved by million to a loss before taxes of for the year ended december  from a loss before taxes of for the same period of sales volume at current margin levels was insufficient to cover certain fixed costs resulting in a loss before tax 
middle east revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  results improved nominally to a loss before taxes of for the year ended december  from a loss before taxes million during the year ended december  in the company repositioned its derrick pipelay barge  the navajo  from middle east to west africa 
liquidity and capital resources our cash balance increased by million to million at december  from million at december  during the year ended december   our operations generated cash flow of million  compared to million in cash flow from operations funded financing activities of million  which includes the net repayment of debt of million offset by million of net proceeds of our secondary common stock offering which was completed at the end of march cash from operations also funded investing activities of million 
investing activities consisted principally of capital expenditures and dry docking costs 
working capital increased by million to million at december  from million at december  the increase in working capital is due to an increase in cash and a decrease in current maturities of long term debt partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and advance billings on uncompleted contracts 
working capital is anticipated to continue to increase as activity increases 
at december   our backlog was million  as compared to a backlog of million at december  approximately of the backlog is expected to be performed during the remainder of our capital expenditures during the year ended december  aggregated million 
we estimate that the cost to complete capital expenditure projects in progress at december  will be approximately million  all of which is expected to be incurred during the next twelve months 
these projects are primarily related to vessel upgrades 
long term debt outstanding at december  including current maturities includes million of title xi bonds and million drawn against the credit facilities discussed below 
prior to march   we maintained a credit facility  which consisted of a million term loan facility and a million revolving loan facility 
on march   the term loan facility was repaid in its entirety from the proceeds of an equity offering as discussed below 
the remaining facility consisted exclusively of the million revolving loan facility 
this facility matures on december  the revolving loan facility permits both prime rate bank borrowings and london interbank offered rate libor borrowings plus a floating spread 
the spreads can range from to and to for prime rate and libor based borrowings  respectively 
in addition  the credit facility allows for certain fixed rate interest options on amounts outstanding 
stock of our subsidiaries  certain real estate  and the majority of our vessels collateralize the loans under the credit facility 
this facility currently prohibits the payment of dividends

at december   we were in compliance with this credit facility and all financial covenants 
at december  and  million and million were drawn against this facility  respectively  and our spreads were libor plus and libor plus  respectively 
on april   we amended and restated our revolving loan facility to provide an additional million day revolving credit line 
we paid a million fee for this amendment 
this new credit line was entered into to provide additional working capital for us in anticipation of increases in activity 
the amended revolving loan facility is subject to certain financial covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants under this facility 
at december   no amounts were drawn against this facility 
at december  our aggregate revolving facilities total million 
in february  we cancelled the million day revolving credit line 
we believe that there is sufficient capacity under our remaining million revolving loan facility to fund our anticipated needs 
as of march   we had an aggregate of million of credit availability under our credit facility 
we completed a secondary offering of million shares of common stock and million shares of common stock on march  and april   respectively  which raised million in aggregate proceeds  net of underwriting fees and other expenses of million 
we received million and million of proceeds in march and april  respectively 
these proceeds were used to repay million in outstanding indebtedness under our term loan facility and million under our revolving loan facility on march  in the first quarter of  we recorded a million charge relating to unamortized term loan origination fees associated with the early repayment of our term loan 
the remaining proceeds and other additional cash sources were used to redeem million of lake charles port improvement bonds on june  and to repay the heller term note of million on may  our title xi bonds mature in   and the bonds carry interest rates of   and per annum  respectively  and require aggregate semi annual payments of million  plus interest 
the agreements pursuant to which the title xi bonds were issued contain certain covenants  including the maintenance of minimum working capital and net worth requirements 
if not met  additional covenants result that restrict our operations and our ability to pay cash dividends 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
we also have a million short term credit facility at one of our foreign locations which is secured by a letter of credit 
additionally  in the normal course of business  we provide guarantees and performance  bid  and payment bonds pursuant to agreements  or in connection with bidding to obtain such agreements to perform construction services 
all of these guarantees are secured by parent company guarantees 
the aggregate of these guarantees and bonds at december  was million in surety bonds and million in bank guarantees and letters of credit 
on august   we announced that we obtained authorization from our lenders to repurchase up to million of our stock under our existing stock repurchase program 
under this program  the company may expend up to million to purchase shares of our outstanding stock 
during the year ended december   we repurchased an aggregate of million shares of stock for a total of million 
as of december   we had purchased million shares since the inception of the stock repurchase program at a total cost of million 
these shares are held in treasury 
in april of  we entered into a long term agreement to charter the titan  a foot dynamically positioned self propelled twin hulled derrick ship 
the vessel charter payments  which include the cost of an operational crew  supplies excluding fuel  and all maintenance and regulatory expenses  are expected to be approximately million annually 
in  we prepaid million of charter payments  which are systematically applied to future charter payments 
this charter term is months 
this charter can be cancelled by us  subject to a termination penalty of million and the transfer of title of the dynamic positioning dp system to the owner 
the dp system was purchased by us and installed on the titan in the first quarter of at a total cost of million 
minimum rental commitments under leases having an initial or remaining non cancelable term in excess of one year for each of the five years following december  and in total thereafter follow in thousands thereafter total  we expect funds available under the existing credit facility  available cash  and cash generated from operations to be sufficient to fund our operations including the anticipated increase in working capital required to fund increasing activity  scheduled debt retirement  and planned capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
in addition  as we have historically done  we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of equipment or businesses  which may require additional liquidity 
for flexibility  we maintain a shelf registration statement that as of march  permits the issuance of up to million of debt and equity securities 
industry outlook events and circumstances in both our domestic and international markets have changed the way we must operate our business 
we are constantly adapting our business to better capitalize on these market place conditions 
we have recently made changes to reorganize and strengthen our management structure and existing business lines  offshore construction and installation and diving  to focus on core operations and specialized markets 
we are currently in the process of eliminating certain non core and under performing assets 
in addition  we are actively pursuing opportunities in the dismantlement and removal of offshore structures  which will advance our strategy of servicing the entire life cycle of an oil and gas development 
we are confident that the actions we are taking will enhance future operations and financial performance worldwide 
although there are many uncertainties facing our industry and oil and gas prices continue to be volatile  we are optimistic about our future prospects and the future prospects of our industry 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
amortization of goodwill  including goodwill recorded in past business combinations  ceased upon adoption of this statement 
we completed the required impairment test in the second quarter of and determined that the implementation of this statement will not have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we discontinued the amortization of goodwill upon the adoption of this statement on january  a reconciliation of previously reported net income and earnings per share to the amounts adjusted for the exclusion of goodwill amortization net of tax follows in thousands  except per share data year ended december  reported net loss income    add goodwill amortization  net of tax   adjusted net loss income    reported net loss income per share add goodwill amortization  net of tax per basic share adjusted basic earnings per share adjusted diluted earnings per share the carrying amounts of goodwill as of december  and december   were approximately million and are primarily attributable to the company s latin america segment 
sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  requires the recording of liabilities for all legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the normal operation of those assets 
these liabilities are required to be recorded at their fair values which are likely to be the present values of the estimated future cash flows in the period in which they are incurred 
sfas no 
requires the associated asset retirement costs to be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
the asset retirement obligation will be accreted each year through a charge to expense 
the amounts added to the carrying amounts of the assets will be depreciated over the useful lives of the assets 
we were required to implement sfas no 
on january  based on current expectations we do not expect the implementation of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
we do not expect the implementation of this standard to currently have a significant effect in our financial position or results of operation 
significant accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from construction contracts  which are typically of short duration  are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by relating the actual cost of work performed to date to the current estimated total cost of the respective contract 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect vessel costs  labor  supplies  and repairs 
provisions for estimated losses  if any  on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
selling  general  and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
significant changes in cost estimates due to adverse market conditions or poor contract performance could affect estimated gross profit  possibly resulting in a contract loss 
moreover  adjustments  if any  are reflected in income in the period when any adjustment is determined 
to the extent that an adjustment results in a reduction of previously reported profits  we could recognize a charge against current earnings to reflect the adjustment 
accounts receivable the company s accounts receivables include both billed and unbilled receivables 
these receivables often include claims and unapproved change orders 
the company includes claims and unapproved change orders to the extent of costs incurred in contract revenues when the contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the claim  additional costs are not the result of deficiencies in the company s performance  costs are identifiable and  evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable 
the claims and unapproved change orders  included in accounts receivable and unbilled receivables  amounted to million at december  and million at december  unbilled retainage at december  was million and is expected to be billed in unbilled retainage at december  was million 
the company continually monitors its receivables for collectability and makes the appropriate allowances when deemed necessary 
historically the company has not experienced any significant losses on receivables 
property and equipment long lived assets held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying values can be recovered through projected net cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges  based on expected operating results over their remaining lives 
future adverse market conditions or poor operating results could result in the inability to recover the current carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
income taxes at december   the company has an available net operating loss nol carryforward for regular us federal income tax and foreign jurisdiction purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which  if not used  will expire between and  and between and  respectively 
the company also has a capital loss carryforward of million  which  if not utilized  will expire in the company believes that it is more likely than not that all of the nol and capital loss carryforwards will be utilized prior to their expiration 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the risk of changing interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
in  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which effectively modified the interest characteristics of million of our outstanding long term debt 
the agreement involved the exchange of a variable interest rate of libor plus for amounts based on fixed interest rates of plus 
the swap will mature in five months 
the transaction was entered into in the normal course of business primarily to hedge rising interest rates 
the estimated fair market value of the interest rate swap based on quoted market prices was million as of december  a hypothetical basis point decrease in the average interest rates applicable to such debt would result in a change of approximately million in the fair value of this instrument 
interest on approximately million  or of our long term debt with a weighted average interest rate of at december   was variable  based on short term market rates 
thus  a general increase of in short term market interest rates would result in additional interest cost of million per year if we were to maintain the same debt level and structure 
also  we have approximately million fixed interest rate long term debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of approximately and a market value of approximately million on december  a general increase of in overall market interest rates would result in a decline in market value of the debt to approximately million 
we use natural hedging techniques to hedge against foreign currency exchange losses by contracting  to the extent possible  international construction jobs to be payable in us dollars 
we also  to the extent possible  maintain cash balances at foreign locations in us dollar accounts 
we do not believe that a change in currency rates in the regions that we operate would have a significant effect on our results of operations
