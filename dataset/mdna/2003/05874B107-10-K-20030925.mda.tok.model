item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources as of june   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
in addition we had net working capital of approximately million  an increase of approximately million from june   which is explained in the working capital section below 
consolidated cash and cash equivalents at june   includes approximately million of cash utilized in our casino operations that is held in vaults  cages or change banks 
additionally  pursuant to various state gaming regulations  we maintain certain cash accounts to ensure availability of funds to pay wide area progressive jackpot awards  which totaled approximately million at june  in september  we completed a refinancing of our senior bank credit facility  which now consists of a million term loan  and a million revolving credit facility which can be increased by up to million upon the consent of the bank group  any time during the term of the agreement the refinancing 
proceeds from the term loan were used to repay our existing bank term loans totaling approximately million  repay million of our senior subordinated notes and to pay transaction fees and expenses 
the new term loan has a per year mandatory principal amortization  with a year maturity and bears interest at libor plus 
the revolving credit facility commitment decreases ratably over the year term of the commitment to a balloon and bears interest at libor plus 
the bank loan contains certain financial and operational covenants  however there are no borrowing base requirements 
as of the initial borrowing date on september  we are in compliance with the covenants 

table of contents alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  as a result of the refinancing described above  the company will record a pre tax charge in the september period of approximately million  which includes million for the early extinguishment of the subordinated notes  and million for the non cash write off of deferred financing costs 
management believes that cash flows from operating activities  cash and cash equivalents held and the availability of the revolving credit facility commitment will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity 
at june   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures

customer financing management believes that customer financing terms and leasing have become an increasingly important competitive factor for the bally gaming and systems business units 
competitive conditions sometimes require bally gaming and systems to grant extended payment terms on gaming machines  systems and other gaming equipment  especially 
table of contents alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  for sales in emerging markets 
while these financings are normally collateralized by such equipment  the resale value of the collateral in the event of default may be less than the amount financed 
accordingly  we have greater exposure to the financial condition of our customers in emerging markets than had historically been the case in established markets like nevada and atlantic city 
during fiscal  the company provided equipment financing to two native american tribes totaling million 
these notes have terms of and months and rate of interest of and  respectively 
both of these notes are currently performing in accordance with their terms

for the year ended june  from discontinued operations in s operating depreciation income and loss amortization ebitda wall machines and amusement games route operations we believe that the analysis of ebitda is a useful adjunct to operating income  net income  cash flows and other gaap based measures 
however  ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to net income loss or cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities determined in accordance with gaap or as a measure of liquidity 
ebitda is a common measure of performance in the gaming industry but may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we disclose ebitda primarily because it is a performance measure used by management in evaluating the performance of our business units and is one of several performance measures used in our management incentive plan 
additionally  ebitda is utilized as a performance measure in covenants for our bank credit agreement

high leverage  ability to service debt  liquidity as of june   the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our long term indebtedness including current maturities was million from our continuing operations and million from our discontinued operations 
upon the completion of the refinancing in september  we replaced our existing bank debt and senior subordinated notes with approximately million of term loans  and million drawn on the revolving credit facility 
our new credit facility contains a number of significant covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability and certain of our subsidiaries to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock  pay dividends or make other distributions  enter into certain acquisitions  repurchase equity interests as defined or subordinated indebtedness  issue or sell equity interests of our subsidiaries as defined  engage in mergers or consolidations  or engage in certain transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates and otherwise restrict corporate activities 
there can be no assurance that such restrictions will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest 
in addition  the bank credit facility also requires us to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios 
our ability to comply with such ratios may be affected by events beyond our control 
a breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under the bank credit facility 
in the event of any such default  the lenders under the credit facility could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facility  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be due and payable and to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay such borrowings 
if we were unable to repay any such borrowings when due  the lenders could proceed against our collateral 
if the indebtedness under the bank credit facility were to be accelerated  there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full 
our obligation to make principal and interest payments on outstanding indebtedness  and to comply with the covenants in the agreements governing borrowings under the bank credit facility  will have several important effects on our future operations including the following i the portion of our cash flow from operations which will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness will not be available for other purposes  
table of contents alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  ii the bank facility borrowings are at variable rates of interest  which could result in higher expense in the event of increases in interest rates  iii we may be more vulnerable to downturns in our business or in the general economy and may be restricted from making acquisitions  introducing new technologies or exploiting business opportunities  and iv our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  general corporate or other purposes may be impaired 
additionally  our ability to meet our debt service obligations and to reduce our total debt will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to general economic and regulatory conditions and to financial  business and other factors affecting our operation  many of which are beyond our control 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to generate the cash flow necessary to permit us to meet our fixed charges and repayment obligations 
any inability of us to service our fixed charges and repayment obligations would have a significant adverse effect on us 
competition bally gaming and systems 
the market for gaming machines is extremely competitive  and there are a number of established  well financed and well known companies producing machines that compete with each of bally gaming and systems product lines in each of bally gaming and systems markets 
the domestic market for gaming machines is dominated by a single competitor  international game technology igt  with a number of smaller competitors in the field 
in addition  certain technology oriented companies have recently entered or may enter the gaming machine market 
management believes that some of these competitors have greater capital resources than we do 
competition among gaming machine manufacturers  particularly with respect to sales of gaming machines to new and emerging markets  is based on competitive customer pricing and financing terms  appeal to the player  product quality  and having an extensive distribution and sales network 
sales to established casinos in nevada normally require completion of a successful trial period for the machines in the casino 
the competition for casino enterprise systems currently consists of igt  aristocrat  acres gaming  inc  mis  and  to a lesser extent  konami and mikohn gaming corporation 
competition is keen in this market due to the number of providers and the limited number of casinos and the jurisdictions in which they operate 
pricing  product feature and function  accuracy  and reliability are all main factors in determining a provider s success in selling its system 
bally gaming and systems believes the future success of our operations will be determined by our ability to bring new and innovative products to the marketplace while at the same time maintaining the base of loyal existing customers 
casino operations 
the operation of casinos is also a highly competitive business 
the principal competitive factors in the industry include the quality and location of the facility  the nature and quality of the amenities and customer services offered and the implementation and success of marketing programs 
in sparks  nevada  the principal competition for our operations comes from larger casinos focusing on the local market 
our rainbow casino in vicksburg  mississippi faces intense direct competition from other gaming facilities serving the vicksburg market 
competition from casinos in nearby locations may also be reducing the market from which vicksburg casinos draw most of their patrons 
moreover  additional potential gaming sites remain in and around vicksburg and sparks  some of these sites may be closer to larger population centers and  if developed  might enjoy a competitive advantage over our casinos 
route operations discontinued operations 
the competition for obtaining and renewing route contracts in nevada is high and continues to intensify 
such competition has  over time  reduced our gross profit margins for such operations 
in addition  such competition has required us to provide financial incentives to retain or obtain certain route locations 
such incentives include long term lease commitments  guarantees of leases in favor of owners of local establishments  substantial promotional allowances and advance deposits  payments of lease rentals in advance  payment of one time fees for the right to operate gaming locations and loans for buildings and tenant improvement costs 
notwithstanding our business strategy of emphasizing profitability rather than market share  the future success of our route operations will continue to be dependent to some extent on our ability and willingness to provide such financial inducements 
although we have historically generated sufficient new route contracts to offset the loss of old route contracts  due to increased competition  the increased sophistication and bargaining power of customers and possibly other factors not yet known  there can be no assurance that we will be 
table of contents alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  able to obtain new route contracts or renew or extend our route contracts upon their expiration or termination  or that  if renewed or extended  the terms will be as favorable to us 
in louisiana  our route operations at the racetrack and otbs compete with various truck stops and locations with liquor licenses throughout the new orleans area  as well as riverboat gaming and one land based casino 
product development our future success depends to a large extent upon our ability to design  manufacture and market technologically sophisticated and entertaining products that achieve high levels of player acceptance 
the development of a successful new product or product design by a competitor could adversely affect sales of our products and force us to attempt to respond quickly with our own competing products 
response speed is lower in jurisdictions requiring product approvals prior to commercialization 
our plan with respect to the introduction of more sophisticated technology into the electronic gaming machine market is designed to lead to an increase in market share and profitability for us 
however  there is no assurance that any such products will be developed  or that if developed they will receive necessary regulatory approvals or be commercially successful 
although we are developing a number of new products  there can be no guarantee of commercial acceptance of any of our products 
the gaming industry is employing new technology in many new areas  and we and our competitors continue to file for patents protecting such technologies 
although we are not aware of any patent violations  there can be no assurances that patents currently pending may be determined to have infringed upon an existing patent held by a third party 
bally gaming and systems continues to deploy new products that are placed in casinos and earn recurring revenues and cash flows 
the amount of revenues earned is dependent on the earning power of the game 
the games will likely have a shorter life than more traditional games  and we will have to continue to design and deploy successful games to maintain this stream of revenue 
there can be no assurance that the games recently deployed will be successful or that we will be able to design and deploy new recurring revenue games 
sales to non traditional gaming markets the continued growth of the non traditional markets outside of nevada and atlantic city for electronic gaming machines is contingent on the public s acceptance of these markets and an ongoing regulatory approval process by federal  state and local governmental authorities 
we cannot predict which new jurisdictions or markets  if any  will approve the operation of electronic gaming machines  the timing of any such approval or the level of our participation in any such markets  or whether jurisdictions currently permitting gaming will continue to do so in the future 
management believes that customer financing terms and leasing have become increasingly important competitive factors for the bally gaming and systems 
competitive conditions sometimes require bally gaming and systems to grant extended payment terms on gaming machines  systems and other gaming equipment  especially for sales in emerging markets 
while such equipment normally collateralizes these financings  the resale value of the collateral in the event of default may be less than the amount financed 
accordingly  we have greater exposure to the financial condition of our customers in emerging markets than had historically been the case in established markets like nevada and atlantic city 
foreign operations our business in foreign markets is subject to the risks customarily associated with such activities 
these risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls  expropriation  nationalization and other economic  tax and regulatory policies of local governments as well as the laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and investment 
as of june   bally gaming and systems has million of receivables from customers in countries outside of the united states most of which are denominated in us dollars 
we do not generally enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 

table of contents alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  dependence on key personnel our success will be dependent  to a significant extent  on the continued services of a relatively small group of executive personnel 
the loss or unavailability of one or more of such executive officers or the inability to attract or retain key employees in the future could have an adverse effect on our operations 
strict regulation by gaming authorities the manufacture and distribution of gaming machines and the conduct of gaming operations are subject to extensive federal  state  local  and foreign regulation by various gaming authorities each  a gaming authority 
although the laws and regulations of the various jurisdictions in which we operate vary in their technical requirements and are subject to amendment from time to time  virtually all these jurisdictions require licenses  permits  documentation of the qualification  including evidence of integrity and financial stability  and other forms of approval for companies engaged in gaming operations and the manufacture and distribution of gaming machines as well as for the officers  directors  major stockholders  and key personnel of such companies 
the company and our key personnel have obtained  or applied for  all government licenses  registrations  findings of suitability  permits and approvals necessary for the manufacture and distribution  and operation where permitted  of its gaming machines in the jurisdictions in which it currently does business 
however  there can be no assurance those licenses  registrations  findings of suitability  permits  or approvals will be given or renewed in the future or that we will obtain the licenses necessary to operate in emerging markets 
additionally  there can be no assurance that any regulatory agency will not enact new rules or change regulations that would negatively impact our ability to operate or our financial results 
gaming taxes and value added taxes gaming operators are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to corporate and state income taxes  and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time 
any material increase in these taxes or fees  which could occur prospectively or retroactively  would adversely affect us 
we pay and expect to continue to pay substantial taxes and fees in nevada and mississippi 
the new jersey legislature recently enacted an eight percent tax on the proceeds we receive from the operation of wide area progressive slot machines in atlantic city casinos 
we expect to pay substantial taxes and fees in any other jurisdiction in which we conduct gaming operations 
there can be no assurance as to future changes in taxation on gaming operations 
currency rate fluctuations we derive revenues from our non us subsidiaries  all of which revenues are denominated in their local currencies  and their results are affected by changes in the relative values of non us currencies and the non us dollar 
most of the currencies in countries in which we have foreign operations strengthened versus the us dollar in and  which resulted in assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into more dollars 
we do not currently utilize hedging instruments 
market risks during the normal course of our business  we are routinely subjected to a variety of market risks  examples of which include  but are not limited to  interest and currency rate movements  collectibility of accounts and notes receivable  and recoverability of residual values on leased assets 
we constantly assess these risks and have established policies and practices designed to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas  no assurances can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future 

table of contents alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  we have performed a sensitivity analysis of our financial instruments  which consist of our cash and cash equivalents and debt 
we have no derivative financial instruments 
in performing the sensitivity analysis  we define risk of loss as the hypothetical impact on earnings  of changes in the market interest rates or currency exchange rates 
the results of the sensitivity analysis at june   are as follows interest rate risk upon completion of the refinancing in september  we had total debt of approximately million  consisting primarily of the new million term loan and the initial million borrowing on the revolver 
the bank facility loans are broken into individual loans with varying terms from one to six months 
the interest rate for each loan is set on the borrowing date and is effective for the term outstanding 
if the libor rates were to increase or decrease by basis points  with all other factors remaining constant  earnings would decrease or increase by approximately million on a pre tax basis 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our foreign subsidiaries generally use their domestic currency as their functional currency 
a fluctuation in the exchange rates of these currencies against the us dollar  would result in a corresponding change in earnings reported in the consolidated group of approximately million 
estimates our financial statements are prepared using estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates either favorably or unfavorably  which may impact future results
