item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this report contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
we use words such as anticipate  believe  plan  expect  future  intend and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect management s opinions only as of the date of this report 
our actual results may vary significantly from those reflected in these forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  product development  commercialization and technology difficulties  manufacturing costs  the impact of competitive products  pricing pressures  changing customer requirements  timely availability and acceptance of new products  changes in economic conditions in the various markets we serve and those factors discussed in the section entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors 
we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward looking statements 
readers should carefully review the risk factors described in other documents we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission  including the quarterly reports on form q to be filed by us in fiscal year overview we develop  market and sell a communications platform that we refer to as our ip service delivery platform 
our product is designed to enable network service providers to rapidly deliver a portfolio of communication services to business and consumer customers 
we market our ip service delivery platform through our direct sales force and through resellers to network service providers in asia  europe and north america 
we provide customer service and support for our products directly and through support partners 
the market for our ip service delivery platform is new and evolving  and the volume and timing of orders are difficult to predict 
a customer s decision to purchase our platform typically involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation  testing and product qualification process 
the long sales cycles and the timing of our customers rollout of services made possible by our platform  which affects repeat business  may cause our revenue and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter 
critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  warranties and allowances for doubtful accounts 
additionally  the audit committee of our board of directors reviews these critical accounting estimates at least annually 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for certain judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following accounting policies are significantly affected by the judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition most of our sales are generated from complex arrangements 
recognizing revenue in these arrangements requires our making significant judgments  particularly in the areas of collectibility and customer acceptance 

table of contents assessing the collectibility of amounts invoiced to customers is particularly critical 
to recognize revenue before we receive payment  we are required to assess that collection from the customer is probable 
if we cannot satisfy ourselves that collection is probable  we defer recognizing revenue until we have collected payment 
certain of our sales arrangements require formal acceptance by the customer 
in such cases  we do not recognize revenue until we have received formal notification of acceptance 
although we work closely with our customers to help them achieve satisfaction with our products prior to and after acceptance  the timing of customer acceptance can greatly affect the timing of our revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts in connection with estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay our invoices 
in order to estimate the appropriate level of this allowance  we analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  current customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns 
in future periods  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate and affect their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
inventory valuation in assessing the value of our inventory  we are required to make judgments as to future demand and then compare that demand with current inventory quantities and firm purchase commitments 
if our inventories and firm purchase commitments are in excess of forecasted demand  we write down the value of our inventory 
we generally use a month forecast to assess future demand 
inventory write downs are charged to cost of sales 
during  we charged million of inventory write downs to cost of sales primarily as the result of reduced forecasted demand for our product 
if actual demand for our products is less than our forecasts  additional inventory write downs may be required 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the assets will be written down to their estimated fair value 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital or specific appraisal  as appropriate 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including long term forecasts of overall market conditions and our participation in the market 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of the long lived assets  thereby requiring us to record further asset write downs in the future 
during  we charged million to operating expenses as a result of impairments 
warranties we provide a basic limited warranty  including repair or replacement of parts  and technical support 
the specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending on the customer or region in which we do business 
we estimate the costs that may be incurred under its basic limited warranty and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized 
our warranty obligation is affected by the number of installed units  product failure rates  materials usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary 
in future periods  if actual product failure rates  materials usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  adjustments to cost of sales could result 

table of contents impact of equity issuances on operating results equity issuances have a material impact on our operating results 
the equity issuances that have affected operating results to date include warrants granted to customers and suppliers  stock options granted to employees and consultants and stock issued in lieu of cash compensation to suppliers 
our revenue in and was affected significantly by warrants issued to our first three customers  qwest communications international  inc  aduronet limited and broadband office  inc 
these warrants were issued upon receipt of substantial purchase orders which were preceded by a period of cooperation with us in the marketing  development and refinement of our products 
our revenue from these customers consisted of receipts from sales  including equity issued in connection with sales  less receipts for equity issued in connection with sales 
as of december   the value of the warrants granted to these customers was fully amortized and as a result  our revenue in was not affected by the value of warrants granted to customers 
our costs of goods sold and operating expenses are also affected significantly by charges related to warrants and options issued for services 
furthermore  some of our employee stock option transactions have resulted in deferred compensation  which is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity on our balance sheet and is amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options using the graded vesting method 
the compensation associated with shares and options relating to the following transactions is required to be remeasured at the end of each accounting period 
the remeasurement at the end of each accounting period will result in unpredictable charges or credits in future periods  depending on future fluctuations in the market prices of our common stock non recourse promissory notes receivable during the fourth quarter of  we converted full recourse promissory notes received from employees upon the early exercise of unvested employee stock options to non recourse obligations 
accordingly  we are required to remeasure the compensation associated with these shares until the earlier of the shares vesting or the note being repaid 
deferred compensation expense  which is recorded at each remeasurement  is amortized over the remaining vesting period of the underlying options 
repriced stock options in november  we repriced  outstanding employee stock options to purchase shares of our common stock with original exercise prices ranging from per share to per share 
these options were repriced to per share  which was higher than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the repricing date 
in july  we repriced  unexercised employee stock options to per share  the fair market value of the underlying shares on the repricing date 
these options had previously been granted at prices ranging from to per share 
the repricing requires that compensation be remeasured for these options until they are exercised or canceled  or expire 
some of the stock options granted to our employees have resulted in deferred compensation as a result of stock options having an exercise price below their fair value 
deferred compensation is presented as a reduction to stockholders equity on the balance sheet and is then amortized using an accelerated method over the vesting period of the applicable options 
when an employee terminates  an expense credit is recorded for any amortization that has been previously recorded as an expense in excess of vesting 
results of operations for the year ended december   we reported a basic and diluted net loss per common share of 
for the year ended december   we reported a basic and diluted net loss per common share of

table of contents respectively 
all per share amounts have been restated to reflect our for reverse stock split  which occurred in september revenue we recognize product revenue at the time of shipment  assuming that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable  unless we have future obligations for installation or require customer acceptance  in which case revenue is deferred until these obligations are met 
our product incorporates software that is not incidental to the related hardware and  accordingly  we recognize revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position software revenue recognition 
for arrangements that include the delivery of multiple products  the revenue is allocated to the various products based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe 
we establish vsoe based on either the price charged for the product when the same product is sold separately or for products not yet sold separately  based on the list prices of such products individually established by management with the relevant authority to do so 
revenue from post contract support obligations for specified future periods is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the service period 
revenue from consulting services is recognized as the services are provided 
amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets

based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis  the cash flows expected to be generated by our long lived assets during their estimated remaining useful lives were not sufficient to recover the net book value of the assets

income tax provision provisions for income taxes of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  were comprised entirely of foreign corporate income taxes  which are a function of our operations in subsidiaries in various countries 
the provision for income taxes is based on income taxes on minimum profits the foreign operations generated for services they provided to us 
our tax expense for fiscal will continue to depend on the amount and mix of income derived from sources subject to corporate income taxes of foreign taxing jurisdictions 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively

we have not recognized any benefit from the future use of net operating loss carryforwards for these periods  or for any other periods  since our incorporation 
we are not recognizing the potential tax benefits of our net operating loss carryforwards because we do not have sufficient evidence that we will generate adequate profits to use them 
use of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
deemed dividend in  we sold  shares of series d redeemable convertible preferred stock at per share for which we received proceeds of million

this compares with million at december  operating activities we used million in cash for operations for the year ended december   a decrease of million from the amount used in the decrease in use of cash in was primarily the result of an improvement in working capital and a lower net loss 
the working capital improvement was primarily due to reductions in accounts receivable  inventory and deferred revenue 
we used million in cash for operations for the year ended december   an increase of million from the amount used in the increase in use of cash in was primarily the result of a higher net loss and cash used for working capital 
the cash used for working capital was primarily due to reduction in deferred revenue investing activities for the year ended december   we used million in cash for investing activities  a decrease of million over the decrease in cash provided in represents a reduction in proceeds from the sales and maturities of short term investments partially offset by a reduction in capital expenditures

table of contents million over the increase in cash provided in primarily represents sales and maturities of short term investments 
financing activities for the year ended december   we used million in cash from financing activities  an increase of million from the increase in cash used resulted from reduced proceeds from issuances of common stock

as part of our october restructuring program   was accrued for an expected redwood city  california leased facility settlement 
we believe that we possess sufficient liquidity and capital resources to fund our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next months 
we may require additional funds to support other purposes and may seek to raise these additional funds through debt or equity financing or from other sources 
there can be no assurances that additional funding will be available at all  or that if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us 
outlook we believe that capital spending in the telecommunications industry will recover in the long term two to five years 
however  due to reductions in capital spending plans by our customers and uncertainty within the telecommunications industry  the outlook for growth in is not favorable and the outlook for cannot be determined with certainty at this time 
the lack of capital availability for many emerging service providers combined with the emphasis of larger service providers on reducing operating expenses  has caused a significant reduction in capital spending in the industry as a whole 
while we believe this is a short term up to two years phenomenon  it has had a direct impact on our operations 
we anticipate that this capital spending trend will continue to have a substantial  adverse effect on our revenue growth for at least the remainder of the fiscal year 
because capital continues to be scarce  we believe that pricing will continue to be under pressure as each potential customer attempts to improve returns on invested capital 
until capital spending levels within the telecommunications industry begin to recover  we will focus our efforts on controlling costs and increasing our market share 
however  there can be no assurance that we will succeed in meeting these objectives 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement number  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  sfas which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs 
sfas supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires recognition of the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when we exit the facility  whereas under eitf issue no 
 a liability for an exit cost is recognized at the date a company commits to an exit plan 
in addition  sfas establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs  as well as the amounts recognized 
application of sfas is required for restructuring activities initiated after december  the effect of the adoption of sfas is dependent on our related activities subsequent to the date of adoption

  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
the interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation apply to guarantees issued or modified after december  and we are still assessing the potential impact of that adoption on our financial statements 
we have adopted the disclosure provisions of fasb interpretation no 
for the year ended december  in december  the fasb issued statement number  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
sfas amends statement number  accounting for stock based compensation  sfas to provide alternative methods of transition to the sfas fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas requires disclosure of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
as permitted under sfas  we are adopting only the disclosure provisions of that accounting standard effective for the year ended december  
table of contents risk factors the following discussion describes certain risk factors related to our business as well as to our industry in general 
we have a history of losses that we expect will continue  and if we never achieve profitability we may cease operations 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have incurred net losses since our incorporation 
we cannot be certain that our revenue will grow or that we will generate sufficient revenue to become profitable 
if we do not achieve profitability  we may cease operations 
due to our loss making activity we could lose major opportunities with large service providers who are concerned with our long term financial viability 
many large telecommunications service providers purchase capital equipment from vendors with a history of successful operations including positive cash flow 
our history of losses and use of cash in operations may cause certain service providers to decide not to purchase our equipment because of concerns regarding our long term financial viability and our ability to support their businesses 
unless we can generate positive cash flows by either increasing revenues and or decreasing costs  concerns regarding our long term financial viability may cause some potential customers to purchase product from other larger  more established suppliers including cisco systems  lucent technologies  nortel networks  alcatel  ericsson  siemens and juniper networks 
the outlook for capital spending in the telecommunications industry directly impacts our business 
due to reductions in capital spending plans by our customers and uncertainty within the telecommunications industry  the outlook for growth in is not favorable 
capital spending in the industry as a whole has slowed as a result of a lack of available capital for many emerging service providers and a generally cautious approach to capital spending within the industry 
while we believe this is a short term up to two years phenomenon  we anticipate that this trend will continue to have a substantial  adverse effect on our revenue growth for at least the remainder of the fiscal year 
we participate in a competitive marketplace  and our failure to compete successfully would limit our ability to increase our market share and harm our business 
competition in the network infrastructure market is intense  and we expect that competition in the market for ip networking services will also be intense 
if we are unable to compete effectively  our revenue and market share will be negatively affected 
we face competition from companies in the network infrastructure market  including cisco systems  lucent technologies  nortel networks  alcatel  ericsson  siemens and juniper networks 
we believe that there is likely to be consolidation in our industry 
we expect to face increased competition from larger companies with significantly greater resources than we have 
some of these larger competitors have pre existing relationships involving a range of product lines with the network service providers who are the principal potential customers for our ip service delivery platform 
these competitors may offer vendor financing  which we generally do not offer  undercut our prices or use their pre existing relationships with our customers to induce them not to use our ip service delivery platform 

table of contents the limited sales history of our ip service delivery platform makes forecasting our revenue difficult  which may impair our ability to manage our business 
we were founded in april  shipped our first test ip service delivery platform product in march and sold our first ip service delivery platform product in march we have limited meaningful historical financial data upon which to forecast our revenue 
if our customers are unable to generate sales of services using our products and to manage delivery of these services to their customers  we may be unable to sell our products 
our future success depends on network service providers  who are our customers  generating revenue from the sale of services delivered using our products 
sales of our products may decline or be delayed if our customers do not successfully introduce commercial services derived from our ip service delivery platform or if our customers do not generate revenue from these services sufficient to realize an attractive return on their investment in our ip service delivery platform 
in addition  the long cycle for service providers to introduce new services made possible by our platform may cause our revenue and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our ability to generate future revenue also depends on whether network service providers successfully forecast market trends and identify customer demand for the services and features that our products would enable network service providers to offer their customers 
fluctuations in demand can lead to impairment of the value of our long lived assets fluctuations in demand can also lead to the consideration of asset impairment charges 
the carrying value of property  plant and equipment is reviewed if the facts and circumstances suggest that property  plant and equipment may be impaired 
an impairment review requires management to make certain estimates and judgments regarding future cash flows that management expects to be generated by groups of assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the assets will be written down to their estimated fair value 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including long term forecasts of overall market conditions and our participation in the market 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of the long lived assets  thereby requiring us to record further asset write downs in the future 
if our ip service delivery platform does not rapidly achieve market acceptance  we may be unable to achieve profitability 
our products offer a new approach for delivering services by network service providers  who may perceive our products as being more expensive than the other technologies and products they purchase 
if network service providers do not accept our ip service delivery platform as a method for delivering services to their customers  our ability to increase our revenue  achieve profitability and continue operations would be harmed 
our success also depends on third party software providers recognizing the advantages of our service delivery method and on our ability to effectively support their software development efforts 
our ip service delivery platform is our only product line  and our future revenue depends on its commercial success 
our ip service delivery platform  which is comprised of hardware and software  is the only product that we currently offer to our customers 
our future revenue depends on the commercial success of our ip service 
table of contents delivery platform 
if customers do not adopt  purchase and successfully implement our ip service delivery platform in large numbers  our revenue will not grow 
our products are technically complex and may contain errors or defects that are not found until our customers put our products to full use 
errors or defects in our products could seriously harm our reputation and our ability to sell our products 
our products are more complicated than most networking products 
they can be adequately tested only when put to full use in large and diverse networks with high amounts of traffic 
errors or defects in our products could result in the loss of current customers  the inability to attract new customers and increased service and warranty costs 
the long sales cycle for our platform may cause our revenue and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter  and the price of our stock to decline 
a customer s decision to purchase our ip service delivery platform involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation  testing and product qualification process 
network service providers and other customers with complex networks usually expand their networks in increments on a periodic basis 
we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular and unpredictable basis 
these events may cause our revenue and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter  which could cause our stock price to decline 
if we fail to develop new products or features  we will have difficulty attracting customers 
based on our prior experience  we expect that our customers will require product features that our current ip service delivery platform does not have 
our products are technically complex  and the development of new products or features is an uncertain  time consuming and labor intensive process 
we may experience design  manufacturing or marketing problems with new products 
if we fail to develop new or enhanced products that meet customer requirements  our ability to attract and retain customers will be hindered 
if we fail to execute new product introductions in a timely manner we may experience erratic revenue growth  which could negatively affect profitability and in turn have a negative impact on our stock price 
in addition  such a failure could result in additional costs such as excess inventory  customer conversion costs  higher than expected product costs and higher than expected operating expenses in research and development and in sales and marketing 
we rely upon a limited number of customers  and any decrease in revenue from these customers or failure to increase our customer base could harm our operating results 
the loss of one or more of our customers  a reduction in purchases of our products by our customers or the decline of our customers business may limit our revenue growth and harm our operating results 
our customers may reduce or discontinue purchases of our products at any time 
our future success will depend on attracting additional customers 
failure to increase our customer base would hinder our growth and harm our operating results 
if we fail to retain key personnel  our operations could suffer and our stock price could be negatively impacted 
maintaining key personnel may be difficult for a number of reasons  including but not limited to market demand  stock price  growth opportunities  management philosophy  company performance and competitive activity 
if we lose key personnel we may find it difficult and costly to recruit new management and other personnel and this may have a negative affect on our performance and in turn on our stock price 

table of contents a failure of our contract manufacturers or our sole source and limited source suppliers to meet our needs would seriously harm our ability to timely fill customer orders 
if any of our manufacturers terminates its relationship with us or is unable to produce sufficient quantities of our products in a timely manner and at satisfactory quality levels  our ability to fill customer orders on time  our reputation and our operating results will suffer 
our contract manufacturers do not have a long term obligation to supply products to us 
qualifying new contract manufacturers and starting volume production is expensive and time consuming and would disrupt our business 
we purchase several key components  including field programmable gate arrays  some integrated circuits and memory devices  and power supplies from a single source or a limited number of sources 
we do not have long term supply contracts for these components 
if our supply of these components is interrupted  we may be unable to locate an alternate source in a timely manner or at favorable prices 
interruption or delay in the supply of these components could cause us to lose sales to existing and potential customers 
if any of our significant suppliers were to terminate their relationships with us or compete against us  our revenue and market share would likely be reduced 
many of our suppliers also have significant development and marketing relationships with our competitors and have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do 
if they develop and market products in the future in competition with us  or form or strengthen arrangements with our competitors  our revenue and market share will likely be reduced 
if we fail to predict our manufacturing requirements accurately  we could incur additional costs or manufacturing delays 
we provide forecasts of our demand to our contract manufacturers up to twelve months before scheduled delivery of products to our customers 
if we overestimate our manufacturing requirements  we may have excess or obsolete inventory  which could harm our operating results 
if we underestimate our requirements  our contract manufacturers may have an insufficient inventory  which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and revenue 
if we do not accurately anticipate lead times for components  we may experience component shortages 
if necessary licenses of third party technology are terminated or become unavailable or too expensive  our competitive position and our product offering will suffer 
we license from third party suppliers certain software applications incorporated in our ip service delivery platform 
also  we may need to license technology from other third party suppliers to enable us to develop new products or features 
our inability to renew or obtain any third party license that we need could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or at greater cost 
either of these outcomes could seriously impair our ability to sell our products and could harm our operating results 
insiders continue to have substantial control over us and they could delay or prevent a change in our corporate control even if our other stockholders wanted it to occur 
our executive officers  directors and principal stockholders who hold or more of the outstanding common stock and their affiliates beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock 
these stockholders will be able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this could delay or prevent an outside party from acquiring or merging with us even if our other stockholders wanted it to occur 
if we become subject to unfair hiring claims  we could be prevented from hiring needed personnel  or from pursuing or implementing our research  and could incur substantial liabilities or costs 
companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would 
table of contents involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets or information subject to an obligation of confidentiality 
we have been threatened with claims like these in the past and may receive claims of this kind in the future 
these claims could prevent us from hiring personnel or from using the knowledge and experience brought to us by the personnel whom we hire 
we could also incur substantial costs and damages in defending ourselves or our employees against these claims  regardless of their merits 
defending ourselves against such claims could divert the attention of our management away from our operations 
if our products do not work the way our customers expect  orders for our products may be cancelled and the market perception of our products could be harmed 
if our products do not work with our customers or their end users networks  the market perception of our products could be harmed and orders for our products could be cancelled 
in particular  if an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in a customer s or its end user s network that uses our products  we may be subject to lawsuits for losses suffered by customers or their end users 
if we have to redesign or modify our products to make them compatible with a customer s or end user s network  our sales cycle could be extended  our research and development costs may increase and profit margins on our products may decline 
because the markets in which we compete are prone to rapid technological change and the adoption of standards different from those that we use  our products could become obsolete  and we could be required to incur substantial costs to modify our products to remain competitive 
the market for our ip service delivery platform is prone to rapid technological change  the adoption of new standards  frequent new product introductions and changes in customer and end user requirements 
we may be unable to respond quickly or effectively to these developments 
we may experience difficulties that could prevent our development of new products and features 
the introduction of new products or technologies by competitors  or the emergence of new industry standards  could render our products obsolete or could require us to incur costs to redesign our products 
we rely on our intellectual property rights to be competitive  and if we are unable to protect these rights  we may never become profitable 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark  patent and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  our ability to supply our products as they have been designed could suffer  and our ability to become profitable could be harmed 
if we become involved in an intellectual property dispute  we could be subject to significant liability  the time and attention of our management could be diverted and we could be prevented from selling our products 
we may become a party to litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or because others may allege infringement of their intellectual property 
these claims and any resulting lawsuit could subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidate our proprietary rights 
these lawsuits  regardless of their merits  likely would be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention 
any potential intellectual property litigation alleging our infringement of a third party s intellectual property also could force us to stop selling products or services that use the challenged intellectual property  obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  or redesign those products or services that use the infringed technology 

table of contents if our stock price declines to below  we could be delisted from the nasdaq 
if our stock price were to drop below  our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
a low stock price could also cause some of our potential customers to be reluctant to purchase our products 
acts of war  terrorist activity  and bio terrorism can have a negative effect on the demand for our products 
the terrorist activity on september   the ensuing declaration of war on terrorism  and the war against iraq may result in reduced demand for networking products 
capital spending in the telecommunications industry was already depressed prior to the tragedy  and additional news regarding war and terrorism may negatively impact the demand for our products 
these circumstances may result in delayed purchases  cancelled orders and new technology requirements  which could lead to reduced revenues or increased costs  which in turn could negatively affect our stock price 
we may have difficulty obtaining director and officer liability insurance in acceptable amounts for acceptable rates 
like most other public companies  we carry insurance protecting our officers and directors against claims relating to the conduct of our business 
this insurance covers  among other things  the costs incurred by companies and their management to defend against and resolve claims relating to management conduct and results of operations  such as securities class action claims 
these claims typically are expensive to defend against and resolve 
we pay significant premiums to acquire and maintain this insurance  which is provided by third party insurers  and we agree to underwrite a portion of such exposures under the terms of the insurance coverage 
one consequence of the current economic downturn and decline in stock prices has been a substantial increase in the number of securities class actions and similar claims brought against public corporations and their management  including our company and certain of our current and former officers and directors 
consequently  insurers providing director and officer liability insurance have in recent periods sharply increased the premiums they charge for this insurance  raised retentions that is  the amount of liability that a company is required to pay to defend and resolve a claim before any applicable insurance is provided  and limited the amount of insurance they will provide 
moreover  insurers typically provide only one year policies 
the insurance policies that may cover the current securities lawsuits against us have a  retention 
as a result  the costs we incur in defending the current securities lawsuits against us will not be reimbursed until they exceed  the policies that would cover any future lawsuits may not provide any coverage to us and may cover the directors and officers only in the event we are unwilling or unable to cover their costs in defending against and resolving any future claims 
as a result  our costs in defending any future lawsuits could increase significantly 
particularly in the current economic environment  we cannot assure you that in the future we will be able to obtain sufficient director and officer liability insurance coverage at acceptable rates and with acceptable deductibles and other limitations 
failure to obtain such insurance could materially harm our financial condition in the event that we are required to defend against and resolve any future or existing securities class actions or other claims made against us or our management arising from the conduct of our operations 
further  the inability to obtain such insurance in adequate amounts may impair our future ability to retain and recruit qualified officers and directors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity we do not currently use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading or hedging purposes 
in addition  we maintain our cash equivalents in government and agency securities  debt instruments of financial institutions and corporations and money market funds
