item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general 
our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to us individual and institutional investors in our sponsored mutual funds and other investment portfolios 
investors outside the united states account for just over of our assets under management 
we manage a broad range of us domestic and international stock  bond  and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors 
investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under management 
accordingly  fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations 
total assets under our management were billion at december   including billion in equity securities and billion in bond and money market holdings 
lower financial market valuations more than offset our net investor inflows in and decreased our assets under management by or billion over the course of the year 
our expenditures to broaden our investor base may be significant and precede the revenues that we may obtain from any new investment advisory clients 
results of operations 
versus net income decreased about million  or  to million 
diluted earnings per share was unchanged at as lower weighted average shares and share equivalents outstanding due to our repurchase of million common shares in and our common stock s generally lower per share market value offset the decline in net income 
with the adoption of the new accounting standard for goodwill on january   we have ceased amortizing the goodwill that is recognized in our consolidated balance sheet 
after excluding the amortization of goodwill in the amount of million  adjusted net income for was million and adjusted diluted earnings per share was 
total revenues declined million  or  to million and net revenues declined a similar or million to million 
investment advisory revenues earned from the t 
rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states decreased million as average fund assets under management were billion during  billion less than in weakness in financial market valuations that began in early have continued nearly three years 
during the second half of  us equity market valuations fell to levels last seen in the first half of mutual fund assets ended at almost billion  down billion from december  and nearly billion from the average 
the price funds had billion of net cash inflows during  the highest net annual inflows since  however  market depreciation  net of income and dividends paid but not reinvested  more than offset the inflows and reduced fund assets billion in money market and bond funds had net investor subscriptions of billion and stock funds added an additional billion of net inflows 
bond fund investors seeking higher yields added million to the high yield fund in net inflows of billion to us domestic stock funds in were led page primarily by value oriented investors in the equity income  mid cap value  and small cap value funds while international stock fund investors had net redemptions of billion during the year 
investment advisory revenues earned from the other investment portfolios that we manage were down million in on lower assets under management that also resulted from lower market valuations 
the value of the assets in these portfolios decreased billion during to billion at year end as net cash inflows of billion were more than offset by billion of market value losses 
additionally  performance based advisory fees were down million from to million in we earn these fees primarily from a managed disposition service for distributions of venture capital investments and  though recurring  these fees will vary significantly over time 
they have declined during the past two years as market conditions were unfavorable and investment portfolios changed 
administrative revenues and other income decreased million from to million in this decrease is primarily attributable to transfer agency and participant recordkeeping services that we provide for defined contribution retirement plans and was partially offset by a million increase in b distribution fees received from our advisor class of mutual fund shares 
these revenue changes are generally offset by similar changes in the expenses that we incurred to provide the services and distribute the advisor shares through third parties 
total revenues also increased million on greater investment income from the larger investment portfolio of our savings bank subsidiary 
our savings bank depositor base increased from million at december  to million at the end of interest expense on the higher deposits increased million 
we manage the assets of our savings bank as a portfolio in a manner similar to that of our other investment advisory clients 
the net of our investment portfolio income and depositor interest expense results in a net revenue amount that is similar to the investment advisory fees earned on the investment portfolios that we manage 
operating expenses in were million less than in the elimination of the amortization of goodwill accounts for million or about of the decrease 
our largest expense  compensation and related costs  decreased or million from our average staff size  use of temporary personnel in the technology operations group  and total levels of compensation were all lower in attrition and a late staff reduction lowered our average number of associates in by from the average level 
at december   we employed  associates  up from the average 
advertising and promotion expenditures were down million in as we again curtailed these expenditures due to weak financial market conditions that have made investors more cautious and less active 
we vary our promotional spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as our efforts to expand our investor base in the united states and abroad 
we expect our advertising and promotion expenditures in the first half of to be similar to the first half of market conditions in the second half of the year will dictate our spending then 
occupancy and facility costs and other operating expenses in decreased million and million  respectively  versus these reductions primarily reflect the first half completions of several technology initiatives as well as the international facilities and infrastructure transition that resulted from the august purchase of page robert fleming holdings interest in our consolidated subsidiary  t 
rowe price international 
through the first half of  we incurred substantial costs to establish and transition this entity to new operating facilities with appropriate infrastructure support for their international investment operations 
robert fleming affiliates previously provided the space and infrastructure support for these offices 
overall  net operating income was up million from to including the goodwill amortization of million in that did not recur in non operating income and expenses include the recognition of investment gains and losses as well as interest expense incurred on our indebtedness 
while we recognized million of net investment income in  we experienced a net investment loss of million in as interest and dividend income of million was more than offset by losses across all of our investment portfolios 
during  we recognized million of losses on dispositions and other than temporary impairments of our mutual fund holdings  million of losses on our holdings of collateralized bond obligations  million of losses from exchange rate fluctuations on our yen debt  and million of valuation decreases in our private equity holdings 
our mutual fund investment holdings at december  include an aggregate net gain  before income taxes  of million that is included in stockholders equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive income 
this net gain has not been recognized in our statements of income and comprises aggregate gains of million and aggregate losses of million that have arisen since june  and are considered temporary 
interest expense on our debt is down more than million due to lower principal balances and interest rates in overall  we recognized a net non operating loss of million in versus net non operating income of million in the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is lower than that of due primarily to eliminating the amortization of nondeductible goodwill in versus the presentation of our results of operations in our consolidated statements of income for and has been changed to conform to our presentation 
the following narrative has been modified from that presented in our annual report to provide a discussion that can be read in conjunction with the new presentation in our consolidated income statement 
net income decreased million  or  to million  and diluted earnings per share fell from to 
a full year s amortization of goodwill arising from the t 
rowe price international acquisition accounted for 
of the decline 
total revenues declined from billion to just under billion 
net revenues also declined to million 
investment advisory revenues earned from the t 
rowe price mutual funds decreased million as average fund assets under management were billion during  billion less than in weakness in financial market valuations that began in continued through the terrorist attacks in the united states on september  pushed financial markets down to their lowest levels of the year before they recovered somewhat in the fourth quarter 
mutual fund assets ended the year at billion  down million from the average and billion from the start of page the science technology fund and the international funds accounted for billion and billion  respectively  of the billion net decline in mutual fund valuations during dividends paid by the mutual funds  net of reinvestments  were 
billion in net inflows from fund investors were 
billion in domestic stock funds had net investor subscriptions of more than billion while money market and bond fund investors added almost 
billion 
two us growth funds led the inflows with the small cap stock and blue chip growth funds adding a total of billion from investors 
international stock funds had net outflows of billion 
assets in the other investment portfolios that we manage fell billion during  and our advisory fees thereon were down million 
while the same financial market declines played a significant role in reducing these assets  cash inflows  primarily from third party distribution efforts and international initiatives  added about billion to assets under management in additionally  adverse market conditions pushed performance related advisory fees down million in administrative revenues and other income were down million from discount brokerage commissions fell million from the prior year as investor trading activity and average commission rates were lower 
other administrative revenues declined million but were mostly offset by reduced costs of the services that we provide to the mutual funds and defined contribution retirement plans 
our savings bank subsidiary s customer deposits increased in and added million to total revenues and 
million to net revenues versus operating expenses declined about from million in to million in compensation and related costs is our largest expense and was up only or million from our average staff size was up about versus but total compensation levels  including bonus expense and the use of temporary personnel by our information technology operations  were down in staff reductions  primarily in november  together with attrition during the year reduced our staff to  associates at december   a reduction from the end of our advertising and promotion expense decreased almost or million to million in as we curtailed these expenditures due to weak financial market conditions that made investors more cautious and less active 
international investment research fees were eliminated in august at the time of the t 
rowe price international acquisition 
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment was million higher in due primarily to additional amortization from recently completed software and technology projects  as well as depreciation of new operating facilities 
we completed our move into new space in london in the first quarter of and in colorado springs in the fourth quarter of occupancy and facility costs are down from as the temporary facilities and other additional costs associated with the moves were eliminated 
a full year s amortization of goodwill arising from the t 
rowe price international acquisition added million to our expenses 
other operating expenses decreased or million from as the international transition and several technology initiatives have been brought to a close  we have substantially reduced other operating expenses 
page overall  net operating income was down million from to  including the additional million of goodwill expense 
net non operating income was also down more than million from net investment income declined million to million  with smaller cash and mutual fund holdings as well as lower interest rates in accounting for the decline 
gains from our venture capital investments in that did not recur in were mostly offset by million of greater realized gains from dispositions of our available for sale mutual fund holdings 
interest expense on our debt increased almost million as our acquisition indebtedness was outstanding for only five months in the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is higher than that of largely due to the full year s amortization of nondeductible goodwill 
minority interests declined due to the acquisition and the elimination of the interests in a remaining venture in the first quarter of capital resources and liquidity 
during the three years ended december   stockholders equity increased from million to more than billion 
stockholders equity at december  includes million of unrealized investment holding gains  after provision for income taxes  and million which is restricted as to use under various regulations and agreements arising in the ordinary course of business 
net liquid assets of more than million are available at the beginning of unused committed credit facilities at the beginning of include million expiring in june and million expiring in june during  we repaid million of our debt and expended million in the repurchase of our common shares 
these cash outflows were funded by existing cash balances  proceeds of million from exercises of our stock options  and cash provided by our operating activities 
operating activities provided cash flows of million in as compared to million in net cash expended in investing activities increased million from to million in in we made net redemptions of our sponsored mutual fund holdings of million versus net investments of million in investments in property and equipment in were down million versus while our savings bank subsidiary increased its investment portfolio more than million as a result of increasing its customer deposits 
cash used in financing activities was down about million in versus bank borrowings were reduced million in versus million in with our debt having been substantially reduced  we used our cash flows to step up our share repurchase activity and  on a net basis after increased option exercises  expended nearly million more for share repurchases in anticipated property and equipment expenditures in are approximately million 
these capital expenditures  further debt reductions  and additional share repurchases are expected to be funded from existing cash balances and operating cash flows 
under the terms of existing operating leases  we are contractually obliged to make certain future lease payments 
these aggregate commitments are discussed in note to our financial statements included elsewhere in this page annual report and include million in  million in  million in  and million thereafter 
we have historically funded our operating lease payments from current year cash flows from operations and expect to continue to do so in the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives 
further  significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our balance sheet  the revenues and expenses in our statement of income  and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to the financial statements 
making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time 
accordingly  actual amounts or future results could differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our financial statements and notes thereto 
we have historically presented those significant accounting policies that we use in the preparation of our financial statements as an integral part of those statements and have done so again in this annual report 
in the following discussion  we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements 
the application of these policies often requires significant judgments and estimates 
other than temporary impairments of available for sale securities 
we classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held in the investment portfolio of our savings bank subsidiary as available for sale 
at the end of each quarter  we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss to determine if that loss is other than temporary 
a mutual fund holding that has had an unrealized loss for more than six months is presumed to have an other than temporary loss and an impairment is recognized in our statement of income unless there is persuasive evidence  such as an increase in value subsequent to quarter end  to overcome that presumption 
we may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a near term recovery is possible 
a debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary is considered impaired and an other than temporary loss is recognized whenever we determine that we will probably not collect all contractual amounts due under the terms of the security based on the issuer s financial condition and our intent to hold that security 
goodwill 
as a result of the adoption of a new financial accounting standard on january   we ceased recording recurring charges to amortize the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet 
the new standard instead now requires that we evaluate goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis using a fair value approach 
we make that evaluation in the third quarter of each year 
goodwill is considered impaired whenever the carrying amount of the related reporting unit exceeds page the fair value of that unit 
we attribute all goodwill to our single reportable business segment and reporting unit  our investment advisory business 
because our testing in demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business exceeded our carrying amount basically  our stockholders equity  we concluded that no impairment exists 
should we reach a different conclusion when we conduct our evaluation in subsequent years  additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the non cash charge needed to recognize the impairment 
we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred 
the maximum possible future impairment charge that we could incur is the amount recognized in our balance sheet  million at december  provision for income taxes 
after compensation and related costs  our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our second largest annual expense 
we operate in several states and several other countries through our various subsidiaries  and must allocate income  expenses  and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions 
accordingly  our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business in all locations 
annually  we file tax returns which represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities 
each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations 
from time to time  we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to  or in the process of  being audited by various tax authorities 
because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates  it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements 
in such cases  it is possible that additional expense for prior reporting periods may be recorded in subsequent periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled 
stock options 
the summary of significant accounting policies includes certain pro forma disclosures as if a fair value based method had been used to recognize compensation expense associated with our stock option grants 
the fair value method uses a valuation model for shorter term  market traded financial instruments to theoretically value our stock option grants even though they are not available for trading purposes and are of longer duration 
the model includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations  including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date  the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period  and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time 
additionally  the recognition of expense fluctuates based on the forfeiture rate for unvested options when employees leave the company 
our estimates for the variables used in the valuation model are made for the purpose of theoretically determining an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted 
unlike almost all other expenses  the resulting theoretical charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a non cash charge that is never measured by a cash outflow 
page newly issued accounting pronouncement 
on january   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an interpretation of accounting principles that have existed since in its interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  the fasb defines a variable interest entity as a corporation  partnership  limited liability company  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
the interpretation requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to  among other things  a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s residual returns 
a company that is required to consolidate a variable interest entity is referred to as the primary beneficiary of that entity 
we are presently reviewing the accounting requirements of this interpretation to determine its applicability to our consolidated financial statements 
while our review is not complete at this time  we have initially determined that we hold residual interests in two million high yield collateralized bond obligations cbos for which we may be required to apply the provisions of this interpretation beginning july  these entities are non recourse  limited liability companies in which we hold a portion  though not a majority  of the interests in their residual returns 
we are also the collateral manager of each cbo and receive a market based fee for performance of that service 
we may also receive a market based performance fee  though none were recognized in our maximum exposure to future losses from these interests is the million carrying amount in other assets at december  forward looking information 
from time to time  information or statements provided by or on behalf of t 
rowe price  including those within this annual report to our stockholders  may contain certain forward looking information  including information or anticipated information relating to changes in our revenues and net income  changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management  our expense levels  and our expectations regarding financial markets and other conditions 
readers are cautioned that any forward looking information provided by or on behalf of t 
rowe price is not a guarantee of future performance 
actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking information as a result of various factors  including but not limited to those discussed below 
further  forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made  and we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
our future revenues and results will fluctuate due to many factors  including the total value and composition of assets under our management  cash inflows and outflows in the t 
rowe price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios  fluctuations in the financial markets around the world that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management  the relative investment performance of the price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios as compared to competing offerings and market indices  the extent to which we earn performance based investment advisory fees  the expense ratios of the price mutual funds  page investor sentiment and investor confidence  the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels  competitive conditions in the mutual fund  asset management  and broader financial services sectors  our introduction of new mutual funds and investment portfolios  our ability to contract with the price mutual funds for payment for investment advisory related administrative services provided to the funds and their shareholders  changes in retirement savings trends favoring participant directed investments and defined contribution plans  the amount and timing of income or loss from our private equity  high yield  mutual fund  and other investments  and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business internationally 
our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the price funds determined to terminate or significantly alter the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements 
our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses  which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons changes in the level of our advertising expenses in response to market conditions  including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the united states and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the united states  variations in the level of total compensation expense due to  among other things  bonuses  changes in our employee count and mix  and competitive factors  any goodwill impairment that may arise  fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations and our yen denominated debt  expenses and capital costs  such as technology assets  depreciation  amortization  and research and development  incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure  unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients  and disruptions of services  including those provided by third parties such as facilities  communications  power  and the mutual fund transfer agent system 
our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation  and changes in legal  regulatory  accounting  tax  and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results  including but not limited to effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in mutual funds and investing in general  or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our revenues and net income are based primarily on the value of assets under our management 
accordingly  declines in financial market values directly and negatively impact our investment advisory revenues and net income 
we invest in our sponsored mutual funds  which are market risk sensitive financial instruments held for purposes other than trading  we do not invest in derivative financial or commodity instruments 
mutual fund investments have inherent market risk in the form of equity price risk  that is  the potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair values of the mutual fund shares 
each fund and its underlying net assets are also subject to market risk which may arise from changes in equity prices  credit ratings  foreign currency exchange rates  and interest rates 
page the following table in thousands of dollars presents the equity price risk from investments in sponsored mutual funds by assuming a hypothetical decline in the fair values of mutual fund shares 
this potential future loss of value  before any income tax benefits  reflects the valuation of mutual fund investments at year end using each fund s lowest fair value per share during the past year 
in considering this presentation  it is important to note that all funds did not experience their lowest fair value per share on the same day  it is likely that the composition of the mutual fund investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persist  and we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below 
fair value at potential december  of lower of portfolio value portfolio potential loss stock funds    bond funds    the comparable potential loss of value shown in last year s annual report was million on sponsored mutual fund investments of million at the end of during  we actually experienced net unrealized losses of million in the value of our fund investments 
investments in mutual funds generally moderate market risk because funds  by their nature  invest in a number of different financial instruments 
t 
rowe price further manages its exposure to market risk by diversifying its investments among many domestic and international funds 
in addition  investment holdings may be altered from time to time  in response to changes in market risks and other factors  as deemed appropriate by management 
interest rates on our outstanding debt under the credit facility expiring in june are reset at one to six month intervals 
our borrowing rate on this debt is presently only 
should our cost of funds increase back to the that we experienced in early  and we make no repayments of principal on the existing outstanding balance of million  our interest expense for a full year would increase by million 
the investment portfolio and customer deposit liabilities of our savings bank subsidiary are subject to interest rate risk 
if interest rates change  the change in the net value of these assets and liabilities would not be material 
the us dollar weakened versus the japanese yen again in  and an exchange rate loss was recognized on our yen borrowing 
in evaluating exchange rate sensitivity  a loss of million would be recognized if the yen strengthened from december  other foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are not material 
we also make other investments that we include in our balance sheet in other assets 
we are at risk for further losses on these investments should market conditions deteriorate as they have in the past three years 
at december   we hold investments in a sponsored high yield collateralized bond obligation issued in that is recognized in our balance sheet at million and in private equity and other entities totaling nearly million 
during  we recognized nearly million of losses on these investments and similar ones that we previously held 
page our risk of future loss on these investments cannot exceed the million recognized in our balance sheet 
additionally  we have recognized our interest in daiwa sb investments japan at million using the cost basis of accounting 
our market risk on this investment is primarily limited to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the japanese yen because the functional currency of daiwa sb investments is the yen
