item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements included in this annual report 
in addition to historical and pro forma information  this discussion contains forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual future results could differ materially from those presently anticipated due to a variety of factors  including those discussed in exhibit to this annual report on form k 
overview our company was incorporated in delaware in december prior to our initial public offering the ipo in june  we were a wholly owned subsidiary of deluxe corporation  a minnesota corporation deluxe 
deluxe is the largest check printer in the world 
the shares of deluxe are publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol dlx 
in april  we began the process of combining our company with four of deluxe s other former operating units into an integrated electronic payments and risk management business 
the operations combined were debitbureau  chex systems  inc  deposit payment protection services  inc 
and an electronic check conversion company that deluxe acquired in february in september  we changed the name of our company to efunds corporation 
in january  we combined deluxe s professional services business  efunds it solutions group  inc and efunds international india private limited  with our electronic payments and risk management businesses 
in june  we sold  shares of our common stock to the public at a price of per share 
after the ipo  deluxe continued to own about of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
in december  deluxe distributed all of the shares of our common stock owned by it to its shareholders through a tax free spin off the spin off in which each of its shareholders received approximately 
of a share of our common stock for each deluxe share owned by them 
following the spin off  deluxe ceased to own any shares of our common stock 
in march  we paid cash of million for an approximate interest in access cash international llc  a delaware limited liability company aci 
aci was the second largest independent provider of automated teller machine atm services in the united states 
in september  we entered into an atm deployment and management agreement with aci under which we received fees paid by customers utilizing atms deployed by us and interchange fees from their banks 
aci managed this network of atms in exchange for a management fee determined by reference to the number of atms under management 
effective october   we acquired the remaining approximately equity interest in aci 
the purchase price of the remaining of aci was million  of which approximately million was paid in cash on or prior to the closing date of the acquisition 
payment of the balance of approximately million remains subject to the satisfaction of certain post closing conditions 
during  we acquired four additional independent atm networks through stock or asset purchases 
the companies purchased were hanco systems  inc hanco which managed a network of approximately  atms in states  samsar atm company  inc samsar  a seattle based provider of atm services which managed an atm network of more than  atms in the northwest united states  evergreen teller services  inc evergreen  a california based provider of atm services for more than  atms located throughout california and the northwest united states  and cash resources  inc cri  a colorado based provider of atm services for more than  atms located mostly in the western half of the united states 
the total purchase price of these acquisitions was approximately million of which approximately million was paid in cash 
payment of approximately million of the purchase price is subject to satisfaction of certain post closing conditions 
we currently manage a network of approximately  atm machines 
prior to their acquisition by us  these independent atm networks had been operating at breakeven or a loss 
we expect improvement in our atm business to come from four major sources i reduced operating costs through the integration of sales  marketing  
table of contents operations and facilities  ii the elimination of third party processing fees by migrating the processing of atm transactions to our data centers  iii the redeployment of under performing or idle atms and iv additional revenues from branding and other value added services 
our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to and including the date of the spin off have been prepared using the historical results of operations and historical bases of the assets and liabilities of the deluxe businesses that comprise our company 
the consolidated financial statements for such periods also include allocations to us of certain liabilities and expenses  including profit sharing and other employee benefits  information technology services  facility costs  and other deluxe administrative services costs 
the expense allocations have been determined on bases that both deluxe and we considered to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of the services provided to us or the benefit received by us 
the expense allocation methods are based on number of employees  transaction processing costs  square footage and relative sales 
the financial information presented in this report may not necessarily reflect what our financial position  results of operations or cash flows would have been had we been a separate  stand alone entity for all the periods presented  nor is it indicative of our future financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  intangible assets  reserves and allowances  income taxes and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our net revenues consist of fees for transaction processing and related services  decision support  software and data licensing  maintenance and support  government services  and information technology consulting and business process management services 
our revenue recognition policies for these various fees are as follows transaction processing and service fees are recognized in the period that the service is performed 
these services consist of processing our customers electronic debit transactions and settling the funds with the financial institutions involved in the transactions 
additionally  these services include monitoring atms to alert our customers when potential problems occur 
these fees are charged on a per transaction basis  depending on the contractual arrangement with the customer 
government services fees are recognized in the period services are provided based on monthly fees per benefits recipient 
in connection with the provision of services in the atm management services segment  we earn surcharge and interchange fees 
surcharge fees are those fees the user of an atm pays at the time of the transaction while interchange fees are paid by that user s financial institution 
generally  our arrangements call for us to pay a fee to the occupants of the property at which the atm is physically located 
the amount of this fee typically has some relationship to the surcharge and interchange fees that are collected by us on individual transactions 
based upon the underlying contractual provisions to our arrangements  we record the surcharge and interchange fees that we collect at their gross amounts as revenue and the amounts owed to the occupant of the property at which the atm is physically located as a processing  communication and service cost 
decision support fees are recognized as revenue in the period the services are provided 
decision support services consist of new account applicant and check verification screenings to manage the risk associated with account openings and check acceptance 
decision support fees are based on the number of inquiries against the databases used for screening purposes or monthly fees based on the net monthly sales of the retailer using our check verification products or other similar measures  depending on the product and service 

table of contents we provide professional services consisting of information technology consulting and business process management services 
revenue from providing such services is generally recognized under one of two methods  depending on the relevant contractual terms 
under the time and materials method  which is applied to nearly all of our professional services contracts  revenue is based on a fee per hour basis and is recognized as hours are completed 
under the fixed contract method  a pre set fee is agreed upon for a project  and revenue is recognized proportionately to the percentage of completion of the project 
if the information technology consulting services involve the significant customization of software that has been licensed from us  the license fee is also recognized proportionately to the percentage of completion of the project 
software and data license fees for standard products are recognized when a license agreement has been signed  the license fee is fixed and determinable  collectibility of the license fee is probable  delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance 
if a license contains customer acceptance criteria for which significant uncertainties exist  the revenue is recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
certain software products include multiple modules and the license fee charged to the customer is based on the modules licensed 
if a customer contract requires that we deliver multiple elements  then upfront fees are recognized as revenue if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for each of the undelivered elements 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist  then the total fees of the arrangement are recognized over the term of the related agreement based upon delivery of all essential elements 
software maintenance and support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract or as the services are provided 
the process involved in evaluating the appropriateness of revenue recognition involves judgments about vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of each of the various elements to be delivered in a sale that has multiple components  collectibility of fees  and projections of costs to complete projects for our customers 
intangible assets our intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill  capitalized software costs and acquired contracts 
we capitalize the cost of software developed or obtained for internal use once the preliminary project stage has been completed  management commits to funding the project and it is probable that the project will be completed and that the software will be used to perform the function intended 
capitalized costs include only external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use software  payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the internal use software project  and interest costs incurred  when material  while developing internal use software 
capitalization of costs ceases when the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended use 
software developed or obtained for internal use is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we capitalize the cost of software developed for licensing and resale once technological feasibility has been established 
costs incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility are expensed as incurred 
technological feasibility is established when we have completed all planning  designing  coding and testing activities that are necessary to determine that a product can be produced to meet its design specifications  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
capitalization of costs ceases when the product is available for general release to customers 
such costs are amortized on a product by product basis normally over three years and no longer than five years 
software developed for resale is carried at the lesser of amortized cost or net realizable value 
when we acquire other companies  generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates regarding the fair values of the acquired company s tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets 
based upon these estimates  we then allocate the purchase price to the assets and liabilities of the acquired company for the purpose of recording these items in our financial records 
any unallocated purchase price is considered to be  and recorded as  goodwill 
the distinction between the amount of the purchase price allocated either to tangible assets and liabilities or identifiable intangible assets and goodwill is significant as goodwill is not amortized to the statement of operations but is instead subject to an annual impairment test 
estimates inherent in the process of this purchase price allocation include assumptions regarding the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows  the saleability of inventories  selection of discount rates  contract renewal rates and general market conditions 
where appropriate  we use third party valuation professionals to assist us in making these estimates 
the process of evaluating goodwill and other intangible assets  including capitalized software costs and acquired contracts  for impairment involves judgments about market conditions and economic indicators  estimates of future cash flows and assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our conclusions regarding the carrying value of our intangible assets could change and materially affect our financial 
table of contents position or results of operations 
we recorded a write down of approximately million in for capitalized software associated with ancillary product lines that are being exited 
reserves and allowances we maintain a reserve for expected future losses on certain government ebt contracts 
our estimates of such losses are based on a variety of assumptions including assumptions about future welfare case levels  number of transactions per case and costs related to processing transactions and support services 
these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties and may differ substantially from actual results 
in the event such differences arise  a revision to the loss contract reserve would be required 
any such revision could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers failing to make required payments 
we develop our estimate of the allowance based on our experience with specific customers  our understanding of their current economic circumstances and our own judgment as to the likelihood of their ultimate payment 
we also consider our collection experience with the balance of our receivables portfolio and make estimates regarding collectibility based on trends in aging 
the estimates utilized to calculate our allowance for doubtful accounts were revised during the second quarter of to be more reflective of our recent collection history following the establishment of our collections and credit committee and the implementation of enhanced collection processes and systems 
as a result of this change in estimate  we reduced our estimated uncollectible accounts by million during if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  thereby impairing their ability to make payments  an increase in this allowance could be required in a future period 
income taxes accounting for income taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations 
such judgments would include  but would not be limited to  the likelihood the company would realize the benefits of net operating loss carry forwards  the adequacy of valuation allowances  the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries and the development of valuation models used for measuring the value of certain transactions 
further  our operations are governed by and subject to government regulations in the united states and in foreign countries in which we operate  including laws and regulations relating to taxation and the judgments and estimates used are subject to challenge by domestic and foreign taxing authorities 
the company recognizes tax liabilities at such time as they are judged to be probable of being incurred and they can be reasonably estimated 
it is possible that either foreign or domestic taxing authorities could challenge those judgments and estimates and draw conclusions that would cause the company to incur tax liabilities in excess of those currently recorded 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
although we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period any such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period any such determination was made 
we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be permanently invested and  accordingly  we have not provided for us federal  state income or applicable foreign withholding taxes on those amounts 
undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately million at december  upon any distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to both us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and applicablewithholding taxes payable to the foreign countries 
determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred us income tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with such a hypothetical calculation 
stock based compensation we issue stock options to our employees under the terms of the efunds corporation stock option plan 
generally accepted accounting principles provide two alternative methods of accounting for stock options issued under the terms and conditions that we typically issue such options 
one alternative is to estimate the fair value of the stock option at the date of grant and amortize that value as an expense to operations over the contractual vesting period 
the other option available currently to companies reporting under generally accepted accounting principles is to estimate the fair value of the option at the grant date but only reflect the impact of the amortization in a footnote to the financial statements and to forgo adjusting the statement of operations 
the method a company chooses to apply is a matter of policy 
consistent with our past practices  we utilize the second of these options and we reflect the impact of the option amortization in the footnotes to our financial statements 
as illustrated in note to the financial statements  were we to change our accounting policy on this matter to reflect the expense in our statement of operations  or should generally accepted accounting principles change to require us to reflect this expense in our statements of operations  our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  the relative composition of net revenues and selected statements of operations data as a percentage of net revenues year ended december  net revenue operating expenses processing  communication and service costs employee costs depreciation and amortization other operating costs restructuring and asset impairment charges provision reversal of provision for contract losses total operating expenses income from operations other income expense net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue net revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in electronic payments net revenue was flat at million in as compared to million in reimbursed expenses and revenue from government services contracts both increased in compared to  while other electronic processing revenues decreased primarily due to the previously expected revenue declines associated with processing services performed for the star network during in  concord efs acquired the star debit network  formerly our largest transaction processing customer  and notified us that it intended to terminate star s processing agreement with us and perform the processing for this network at its own data centers 
as part of the transition of this activity  the star network licensed our eft software and contracted for professional services to assist in the migration effort 
the transition of the processing for the star network was completed in september processing revenues derived from this relationship declined from approximately million during to approximately million in we do not expect to realize material revenues from this relationship in the future 
the increase in government services contract revenue was driven by higher ebt case counts and the renewal of certain government contracts at improved rates 
revenues in the government services business are expected to decline in due to the expiration in december of our electronic medicaid eligibility verification system emevs contract with the state of new york and an additional ebt contract 
the combined revenue recognized in from these contracts was approximately million 
additional ebt contracts will begin or renew in  providing incremental revenues of approximately million for that year 
we continue to pursue ebt contracts where we can obtain them on a profitable basis 
atm management services net revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in these increases are primarily due to the acquisition of atm networks from hanco  samsar  evergreen and cash resources which contributed an aggregate of approximately million in new revenue during atm equipment sales also represented a source of increased revenue for this segment during  as revenues from this activity were minimal in we currently manage a network of approximately  atms 
this amount reflects some attrition we experienced in during the process of verifying the inventory of atm machines obtained through acquisitions and during the process of converting these machines from existing processing agreements with third party processors 
we expect to see revenue growth in this segment in due to additional incremental revenues associated with the acquisitions we completed during and from our ongoing sales and marketing efforts 
we believe this business will exhibit improving levels of profitability as we seek to eliminate costs and improve efficiencies 
we may seek to acquire additional independent atm service organizations in the future if appropriate acquisition opportunities become available 
decision support and risk management revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in revenues from our chexsystems sm suite of products increased during as compared to the prior year  attributable primarily to inquiry volume growth driven by our marketing campaign to encourage better customer screening by financial institutions in light of the usa patriot act 
we also saw increased demand in for our fraud detection services from financial institutions 

table of contents the increase in revenues from chexsystems was partially offset by declines in sales of our scan sm and collection products over the prior year 
the decrease in revenues from scan products was attributable to the loss of customers and pricing concessions 
the reduction in our revenues related to collections services is the result of our decision to exit certain ancillary product lines 
we expect that revenues from chexsystems and our fraud protection products will continue to increase in future periods and that revenues from scan and collections products will continue to decline somewhat 
professional services revenues decreased million  or  to million in from million in the prior year 
revenues from software sales declined substantially in as compared to the prior year 
during  software revenue included revenues recognized from the licensing of our eft software to the star network and visa usa 
we did not experience software sales of this magnitude during and do not believe the results from will be replicated in the foreseeable future 
the following table illustrates our revenue generated from software sales year ended december  in thousands license fees maintenance software modifications revenues from information technology services provided under our contract with deluxe were million in as compared to million in in accordance with our agreement with deluxe  a minimal short fall fee  based upon a formula in the contract reflective of our estimated lost profits  was billed to deluxe as it failed to reach the minimum target level of million for software development services for the year 
revenues from other information technology clients declined by million in as compared to the prior year as a result of our decision in to cease offering stand alone information technology development services 
we are reevaluating this decision in business process management bpm revenues  which include outsourcing and customer contact center services  remained relatively flat in as compared to the prior year at approximately million 
our agreement with deluxe calls for us to provide deluxe with accounts receivable  accounts payable and other general accounting and data entry services 
revenues from these services were million in as compared to million in future growth in our bpm business will depend on the acquisition of new clients and the expansion of the services offered to existing clients 
processing  communication and service costs this category includes cost of processing  telecommunications  computer equipment and promotional services 
this category also includes the payments we make to the occupants of the property where the atms that we own or manage are located 
total category costs increased million  or  to million in from million in the prior year 
processing  communication and service costs were of net revenues in  compared to in telecommunications and third party processing charges have increased along with the increase in atm processing revenues associated with acquisitions in the atm management services segment 
we provide the processing for approximately  of the  us atm machines in our network and we expect the processing for the approximately  remaining us atms will be transitioned to our networks as existing contractual commitments expire or as the economics associated with accelerated contract cancellations make it logical to do so  with approximately  such conversions expected to occur during due to existing contractual commitments  processing for the approximately  atms we have in canada will not likely be transitioned to our networks for a substantial period of time 
reimbursed costs increased approximately million during  primarily for customer network charges in the electronic payments business segment 
employee costs expenditures in this category represent employee compensation and related employee expenses  benefits and travel 
these costs decreased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of net revenue  employee costs were in compared to for we began to experience costs savings late in from our restructuring efforts and the curtailment of travel expenditures 
the primary reason for the decrease in employee costs was  however  the elimination of performance based employee compensation for due to reduced revenue and earnings expectations 
performance based compensation expense decreased approximately million for from the prior year 
we expect that performance based employee costs will be reinstituted in we had approximately more full time equivalent employees at the end of than we did at the end of we realized cost savings by re deploying certain development responsibilities to our india based operations and as a result of cost reduction initiatives begun in  such as the consolidation of our data center operations 

table of contents depreciation and amortization these costs represent depreciation of facilities and equipment  amortization of intangible assets  such as capitalized software costs and acquired contracts and  prior to implementation of sfas in  amortization of goodwill 
depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  to million in from million for these costs were of revenue in and of revenue for the prior year 
goodwill amortization of million was recorded in  whereas no such amortization was recorded in the decrease in amortization expense was offset by more amortization of contracts recorded in connection with our acquisitions 
other operating costs expenditures in this category include facility costs  professional  consulting and temporary services  bad debt  and certain administrative costs 
other operating expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in these expenses were of net revenues in and in during  we experienced increased costs for professional services associated with responding to the sec inquiry and the investigation of certain significant transactions we completed in the fourth quarter of  although these increases were partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense 
we expect to continue to make significant expenditures for legal expenses associated with the sec inquiry in and expect an increase in costs for external consultants related to multiple business performance initiatives we commenced in early restructuring and asset impairment charges during  management initiated cost reduction efforts associated with specific product lines and corporate wide initiatives  including the relocation of certain administrative functions to scottsdale  arizona 
these measures resulted in restructuring and asset impairment charges of million 
the charges were comprised of expected severance benefits totaling million for the elimination of over positions primarily in the united states  impairment of fixed assets totaling million including a million charge to write down a building in glendale  wisconsin that is held for sale  lease related costs of million related to the consolidation of facilities  and a charge of million for software impairment related to products that were discontinued 
we expect to pay a significant portion of the remaining severance charges by the end of the second quarter in we expect the various personnel reductions and the movement of positions to our indian subsidiary to positively impact our cash flow in the second half of the charge for lease costs will not change our cash flows as our rental obligations will continue until the expiration of the lease or until we can sub let the related property 
results for included a restructuring charge of million related to the closure of our bothell  washington facility 
reversal of provision for contract losses in the third quarter of  we recorded a million benefit related to a reduction in our estimate of future losses on certain government ebt contracts 
a similar net benefit of million was taken in the third quarter of income from operations income from operations decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in income from operations was of net revenue for compared to for the prior year 
the decrease in operating income for is due primarily to the higher concentration of software sales in this change in revenue mix to more recurring  but lower margin  product lines was offset primarily by the elimination of performance based employee compensation in our results for also include a net benefit from the reversal of provisions for contract losses of million as compared to a million benefit recorded in  and a million restructuring and asset impairment charge as compared to million of similar charges in in addition  we stopped amortizing our goodwill in in accordance with sfas goodwill amortization was approximately million in other income expense net other income net was million for compared to million for the prior year 
interest earned on cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million in as compared to million for the prior year 
these decreases were due to reduced interest rates 
other expense declined million during primarily due to the elimination of equity method amortization following the purchase of aci 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was million in compared to million for the prior year  resulting in annualized effective tax rates of for and for the decrease in our effective tax rate is a result of the cessation of goodwill amortization in as this expense was non deductible for tax purposes  partially offset by a change in the proportion of total taxable income which was earned by our indian subsidiary 
our indian software development and business process management operations qualify for tax incentives associated with businesses that operate within designated geographic locations within india 
such incentives generally provide us with exemptions from indian income tax on certain business income generated from these operations 
as a result of a recent change in indian tax law  effective from april  through march   of this previously tax exempt income will be subject to indian income tax at the rate of 
the remaining tax incentives phase out 
table of contents through march the effect of these tax incentives was to reduce our income tax expense by approximately million in and million in business segment information the following table presents  for the periods indicated  operating income by segment as a percentage of segment revenue  and the unallocated corporate expenses and income from operations as a percentage of total revenue year ended december  income from operations as a percentage of segment revenue electronic payments atm management services decision support and risk management professional services as a percentage of total revenue  corporate income from operations income from operations in the electronic payments business segment increased to million in from million in the prior year 
as a percent of net segment revenues  operating margins were for  an increase over the for the prior year 
we recorded similar benefits for the reversal of provisions for contract losses of million and million in and  respectively 
in  million in restructuring and asset impairment charges were largely offset by an approximately million reduction in performance based compensation expense 
the cost reduction measures implemented in and delivered margin improvements in the first three quarters of  although the loss of star network revenues resulted in margin contraction during the last quarter of cost reduction measures implemented included the relocation of our contact center work to our indian operations 
income from operations in the atm management services business segment increased to million in from million in the prior year 
as a percent of net segment revenues  operating margins were for  an increase from the margin of for revenues in this segment increased due primarily to acquisitions of independent atm service organizations in we expect to see margin improvement in this business in future periods as our integration efforts proceed and efficiency gains are achieved through the consolidation of the operations of acquired businesses  including the transitioning of acquired atms to our internal processing systems 
income from operations in the decision support and risk management business segment increased to million in from million in the prior year 
operating margins were of net segment revenues for  an increase from the for the prior year 
the margin improvement is primarily due to cost savings measures initiated these measures included the closure of our facility in bothell  washington  workforce reductions  transition of contact center work to our indian operations  renegotiation of vendor contracts and in sourcing of certain development activities 
we recorded million of restructuring and asset impairment charges in the segment related to severance  lease expense and asset impairments in  as compared to million recorded in for the closure of the bothell  washington facility 
the increase in restructuring costs was offset by a million reduction in expense recorded for performance based compensation from the amounts recorded during income from operations in the professional services business segment decreased to million in from million in the prior year 
operating margins were of net segment revenues for  a decrease from the seen in the prior year 
the reduction in operating margin is due primarily to the approximately million decrease in software sales as compared to the prior year 
the margin impact of the reduced software sales was somewhat offset by a reduction of approximately million for performance based compensation expense as compared to the prior year 
corporate expenses include  but are not limited to  legal  accounting  human resources  risk management  and executive expenses 
these expenses increased to million in from million in the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to increased professional service fees related to the sec inquiry and the investigation of certain significant transactions we completed in the fourth quarter of and the million of restructuring and asset impairment charges we recorded in expenses for facility rental costs related to the expansion of our facilities in scottsdale  arizona and for corporate insurance and employee health benefits also increased 
these increases were partially offset by an approximately million reduction for performance based compensation  and the elimination of goodwill amortization expense 
we recorded million of goodwill amortization expense in 
table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue net revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in revenue from government services contracts increased approximately million in as compared to the increase was primarily due to increased revenues from medicaid eligibility verification services coupled with an increase in the number of cases processed 
this increase was partially offset by the expiration of an electronic benefit switching contract with citibank in the third quarter of total revenue from aci  including pre acquisition revenue from the atm deployment and management agreement  vault cash agreement and processing agreement in effect prior to our acquisition of aci and from the ownership of aci after our acquisition  increased by approximately million in over this increase resulted from a full year of our relationship with aci in compared with only four months of such relationship in revenue derived from software licensing was million in  an increase of approximately million from this increase resulted primarily from the licensing of our electronic funds transfer eft software to the star network and visa usa 
we do not expect that software transactions of this magnitude are likely to be repeated in the foreseeable future 
our call center in mumbai  india completed its first full year of operations in and generated revenue of approximately million 
this call center commenced operations in mid december and generated less than million of revenue in also contributing to the increase in revenue in was the increased usage of our debit account opening products 
these increases were offset to some extent by a decrease in revenue from our check authorization business of million resulting from customer losses  bankruptcies and pricing concessions associated with the execution of longer term contracts  lower revenue of million from our collections business and a decrease in revenue earned from deluxe 
deluxe has been  and is expected to continue to be  one of our more significant customers 
total sales to deluxe were million and million for and  respectively 
although no longer related parties  we continue to maintain a business relationship with deluxe 
sales to deluxe for the year ended december  include fees related to services provided pursuant to a five year software development and business process outsourcing agreement executed during if deluxe fails to spend a minimum of million for software development services under this agreement in any year  it will be obligated to make payments to us based on a schedule in the contract that is reflective of an estimate of our lost profits 
for the year ended december   deluxe s spending attributable to this component of this agreement was million  which did not meet the minimum spending target and  accordingly  additional fees of million were accrued 
this agreement also calls for us to provide business process management services  including accounts receivable  accounts payable and other general accounting and data entry services to deluxe 
deluxe s annual minimum spending target for business process management services ranges from million in to million in revenue from deluxe for business process outsourcing services was million for the year ended december  processing  communication and service costs this category includes cost of processing  telecommunications  computer equipment and promotional services 
these costs increased million  or  to million in from million in the prior year 
as a percentage of net revenue  processing  communication and service costs were in  compared to in costs related to aci derived from the atm deployment and management agreement  vault cash agreement and processing agreement  in effect prior to our october acquisition of aci  and from our ownership of aci after this acquisition  increased by approximately million to million in from approximately million in this increase resulted from a full year of our relationship with aci in compared with only months of such relationship in we experienced increased hosting costs associated with our debitbureau database  and telecommunication costs also increased due to the cost of improved data links with our indian operations and our need to expand our infrastructure in certain areas as a result of our separation from deluxe 
costs associated with the new call center in mumbai  india also contributed to the increase in costs over last year 
these increases were offset slightly by a reduction in costs resulting from the expiration of an electronic benefit switching contract with citibank in the third quarter of employee costs expenditures in this category represent employee compensation and related employee expenses  benefits and travel 
these costs increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of net revenue  employee costs were in compared to for employee compensation increased upon our separation from 
table of contents deluxe 
we also experienced a reduction in the amount of compensation costs capitalized to development projects  which resulted in the recognition of more compensation expense 
depreciation and amortization these costs represent depreciation of facilities and equipment  amortization of intangible assets  such as capitalized software costs  acquired contracts and goodwill 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million in from million for these costs were of revenue in  and of revenue for the prior year 
the increase depreciation and amortization expense is a result of the high level of capital spending in and to a lesser degree  other operating costs expenditures in this category include facility costs  professional  consulting and temporary services  bad debt  and certain administrative costs 
other operating expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  these expenses were in and in in addition to the absence of allocated costs from deluxe  general consulting fees also decreased in these savings were offset slightly by higher professional and administrative costs associated with becoming a public company
