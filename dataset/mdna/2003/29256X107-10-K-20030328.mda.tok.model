overview since our inception in  we have primarily devoted our resources to funding drug discovery  research and development 
we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel  synthetic  small molecule compounds for the treatment of a variety of cardiovascular  vascular and related inflammatory diseases 
our research and development programs are focused on inhibitors also referred to as antagonists or blockers that can interrupt certain disease processes 
our programs seek to address unmet medical needs in areas where our compounds will have the greatest likelihood of improving the lives of patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases  thrombocytopenia  pulmonary arterial hypertension  heart failure and inflammatory diseases such as asthma 
our strategy is to identify and develop novel product candidates for underserved indications  and to commercialize those candidates through collaborations with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
an important part of our strategy is the selection of corporate partners to enhance our drug discovery and development efforts 
we and our partners currently have three products in clinical development 
for additional information about our programs and business strategy  see overview and business strategy in item  business included herein 
major compounds in research and development programs argatroban argatroban is our first marketed product 
argatroban was approved by the us fda in  is indicated for prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis in patients with hit for patients with or at risk of hit undergoing pci 
argatroban was approved in canada in for use as anticoagulant therapy in patients with heparin induced thrombocytopenia syndrome 
the drug is being marketed in the us and canada by gsk and has been on the market in the us and canada since november and june  respectively 
gsk is our development  manufacturing and marketing partner for argatroban 
during  we completed a phase ii human clinical trial for argatroban as a mono therapy treatment for acute ischemic stroke 
the clinical trial met the primary endpoint and showed positive results in the secondary safety endpoint 
in light of a lack of an overall efficacy trend and the high risk and high cost associated with stroke trials  it is unlikely that we will proceed independently with a full phase ii program 
currently  argatroban is being evaluated by an investigator at the university of texas medical school at houston in a clinical trial  in combination with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator rt pa as a new approach to the treatment of acute ischemic stroke 
argatroban is approved and sold in japan by mitsubishi  the licensor of argatroban and by their licensee as mono therapy for an indication of acute ischemic stroke 
we  along with gsk  are continuing to evaluate the use of argatroban for use in hemodialysis patients and for use in pci 
presently  we have four major product development programs 
endothelin antagonist program 
we are developing sitaxsentan  an endothelin a receptor antagonist  or et a  for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension 
during june  we formed a partnership  icos tbc  with icos corporation to develop and commercialize et a receptor antagonists 
during  icos tbc successfully completed a phase iib iii clinical trial in pulmonary arterial hypertension with sitaxsentan 
tbc  a second generation et a  has previously completed phase i clinical trials and may be developed for cardiovascular or other diseases 
in january  icos announced that they had reached a conclusion that joint development of the endothelin receptor antagonist program by icos tbc should not continue 
icos and tbc are currently negotiating the terms pursuant to which tbc could independently continue the program 
the financial terms of this transaction are subject to ongoing negotiations between the two companies 
after  we are responsible for all costs of the program 
thrombosis 
during  we completed a phase ii human clinical trial for argatroban as a mono therapy treatment for acute ischemic stroke 
the clinical trial met the primary endpoint based on safety and showed positive results in the secondary safety endpoint 
in light of a lack of a positive overall efficacy trend and the high risk and high costs associated with stroke trials  it is unlikely that we will proceed independently with a full phase ii program 
currently  argatroban is being evaluated  in a clinical trial  in combination with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator rt pa as a new approach to the treatment of acute ischemic stroke by an investigator at the university of texas medical school at houston 
vascular inflammation program 
revotar  our majority owned german affiliate located in berlin is developing a selectin antagonist  bimosiamose  for the treatment of asthma and psoriasis 
the intravenous form of the drug demonstrated positive anti inflammatory effects in phase ii clinical trials 
revotar was formed during  to further the development of this program 
revotar completed phase i clinical trials for asthma utilizing an inhaled form of bimosiamose 
a phase iia clinical trial is currently being conducted with an inhaled form of bimosiamose and a phase iia clinical trial in psoriasis is planned to commence during the first half of  using a topical formulation 
a phase iia proof of concept clinical trial in psoriasis  completed during with an injectable form of bimosiamose  demonstrated efficacy 
we are also conducting research with respect to other cell adhesion molecules including vascular cell adhesion molecule  or vcam  junctional adhesion molecules  or jam and several integrins including very late antigen  or vla  alpha beta and others to develop antagonists for the treatment of asthma  rheumatoid arthritis  multiple sclerosis  restenosis and inflammatory bowel disease 
we have signed a collaboration and license agreement for the vla program with schering plough and have received a milestone payment from schering plough for nominating a compound as a clinical candidate 
additionally  we are conducting research on backup vla antagonists for schering plough under this agreement 
vascular disease 
many disease processes involve changes in blood vessels and heart tissue 
there are numerous mediators  like endothelin  which may contribute to the development of these diseases 
several of these act though g protein coupled receptors  gpcrs  to carry out their action 
we are conducting research on urotensin and other gpcrs to identify inhibitors which could be useful in treating diseases including congestive heart failure  chf  ischemic stroke and acute myocardial infarction 
results of operations critical accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize revenue from service contracts as services are performed 
royalty revenue is recognized as products are sold by a licensee and we have received sufficient information to record a receivable 
our royalty revenue is based on net sales of product  that is  sales net of discounts  returns and allowances 
we have estimated a percentage of gross sales  based on recent experience  as an allowance for future returns  however there can be no assurance that our estimate will be accurate 
revenue from collaborative research and development activities is recognized as services are performed 
we defer the recognition of milestone payments related to contractual agreements which are still in the development stage 
such deferred revenues are amortized into income over the estimated remaining development period 
milestone payments received under contractual agreements which have completed the development stage are evaluated  and either recognized into income when earned  or amortized over a future period  depending upon whether the company continues to have obligations under the terms of the arrangement 
license fees received under the terms of licensing agreements for our intellectual property are deferred  and amortized into income over the estimated development period of the licensed item or items 
revenue from grants is recognized as earned under the terms of the related grant agreements  typically as expenses are incurred 
amounts received in advance of services being performed under contracts are recorded as deferred revenue  and recognized as services are performed 
we periodically evaluate our estimates of remaining development periods  and adjust the recognition of remaining deferred revenues over the adjusted development period remaining 
partnership accounting we recognize our share of the operating results of icos tbc in proportion to our ownership interest and record it as equity in loss of icos tbc 
operating results of icos tbc include reimbursed expenses related to our internal research staff that we recognize as revenue and record as collaborative research and development revenue from icos tbc 
due to the nature of the icos tbc collaborative agreement  our collaborative research and development revenue from icos tbc largely depends on the continued progression of clinical trial and development activities  and can be expected to vary from quarter to quarter and year to year 
in january  icos informed us that they had reached the conclusion that joint development of the endothelin receptor antagonist program through icos tbc should not continue 
icos and tbc are currently negotiating the terms pursuant to which we could independently continue the program 
the financial terms of this transaction are subject to ongoing negotiations between the two companies 
this could allow us to increase our ownership and the potential commercial benefit of the program from to 
the partners were responsible for the equal funding of the costs of research and development incurred through the end of after  we are responsible for all costs of the program 
stock options we apply accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations apb in accounting for our stock option plans and apply financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and related interpretations sfas in reporting for our stock option plans 
apb utilizes the intrinsic value of stock options  defined as the difference between the exercise price of an option and the market price of the underlying share of common stock  on the measurement date which is generally the date of grant 
since the exercise price of employee stock options issued under our plans is set to match the market price of our common stock  there is generally no compensation expense recognized upon grant of employee stock options 
options granted to non employees  if any  are valued at the fair value of the option as defined by sfas  utilizing the black scholes option pricing model 
we record compensation expense for the fair value of options granted to non employees 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
general our operating results have fluctuated significantly during each quarter and year  and we anticipate that such fluctuations  which are largely attributable to varying research and development commitments and expenditures  will continue for the next several years 
we have been unprofitable to date and expect to incur substantial operating losses for the next several years as we invest in product research and development  preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory compliance 
we have sustained net losses of approximately million from the date of our inception to december  we have primarily financed our operations to date through a series of private placements and public offerings of our common stock and several collaborative agreements with third parties to jointly pursue product research and development 
see discussion of liquidity and capital resources below 
see also additional risk factors in item business herein 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues in the year ended december  increased  compared with the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to increased royalty income earned on sales of argatroban by gsk and increased license fees  milestones and grants  partially offset by reduced research and development revenues  discussed below 
royalties earned on sales of argatroban in were  an increase of  over year we earn royalties based upon sales by gsk to drug wholesalers 
in october  gsk initiated a broad based hit disease education media campaign designed to increase awareness of hit  the life threatening reaction to heparin for which argatroban is approved 
as medical education is key to growing argatroban sales  we believe this initiative  along with increased selling efforts  are likely to have a positive impact on argatroban sales 
license fees  milestones and grants increased  in  compared with revotar has been awarded research grants from the german government and earned approximately  in year in addition to the grants received by revotar  the increase in license fees  milestones and grants in was primarily comprised of revenues related to the milestone payment received from mitsubishi in may  the milestone payment received from icos in july  and the milestone payment received from schering plough in june see note to the consolidated financial statements 
research agreement revenues  resulting from the company s collaborative efforts with unrelated parties  declined  in  compared with  primarily resulting from reduced research and development effort under the schering plough agreement during most of our efforts toward development of an initial candidate for clinical development had been completed late in as discussed above  we received a milestone payment under the schering plough agreement as a result of the nomination of an initial candidate for schering plough s further development in the second quarter of collaborative research and development revenues received from the icos tbc partnership declined  in  compared with the involvement of our research and development staff in the endothelin receptor antagonist program has been dependent upon the activities being performed by the partnership in any particular period  and was expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year 
in january  icos announced that it had reached a conclusion that joint development of the endothelin receptor antagonist program by icos tbc should not continue 
icos and tbc are currently negotiating the terms pursuant to which tbc could independently continue the program 
the financial terms of this transaction are subject to ongoing negotiations between the two companies 
research and development expenses increased  in  compared with the increase is primarily due to costs of clinical trials which began to incur significant expenses early in year and were ongoing during year trials ongoing during year included a phase ii study of argatroban in ischemic stroke and a phase ii study of argatroban in patients undergoing pci 
during  revotar completed a phase iia proof of concept clinical trial of bimosiamose in psoriasis  and completed a phase i clinical trial for asthma utilizing an inhaled form of bimosiamose 
see also the discussion of our ongoing research and development programs  above 
our equity in the loss of the icos tbc partnership  primarily consisting of research and development expenses  declined  in  compared with the principle activity of the partnership  a phase iib iii trial of sitaxsentan for pah  completed enrollment in july general and administrative expenses increased  in  compared with insurance costs  particularly product liability and general liability policies  increased both due to insurance market conditions  and as a result of increased sales of argatroban 
general and administrative expenses in included costs associated with the retirement  recruiting and hiring of key personnel  including a non cash charge in the first quarter of of approximately  in compensation expense arising from modifications made to stock options previously issued to our retiring ceo 
investment income declined  in  compared with the decline is due to a combination of lower prevailing interest rates during  compared with  and to reduced funds available for investment during year the interest of revotar s minority shareholders in its losses increased approximately  in  compared with revotar s expenses increased in  primarily due to the costs of clinical trials conducted in under accounting principles generally accepted in the us  it is likely that the cumulative losses of revotar will exceed the equity interest of its minority shareholders during  and we will reflect of its losses in our consolidated net income or loss thereafter 
our net loss in increased  in  compared with the increase is due primarily to higher operating expenses and lower investment income during  as discussed above 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues in the year ended december  decreased  compared with the year ended december  license fee and milestone income in year included a milestone payment of  from gsk which was earned upon the approval of argatroban by the fda in june  and the recognition of  in remaining unrecognized license fees and milestones related to argatroban 
after taking the  in revenues related to argatroban into consideration  revenues from other license fees and milestones increased  as a result of the recognition of a portion of the license fees and milestones received from schering plough  mitsubishi and icos tbc in and see notes and to the consolidated financial statements  included herein 
revenues from sources other than license fees and milestones increased  in  compared with royalties earned on the sale of argatroban  which was first shipped in the fourth quarter of  increased  in year compared with year research agreement revenues in year increased  which is comprised of payments received from schering plough  partially offset by the loss of revenues received from lg chemical in  but not in research payments from icos tbc increased  in year the partnership was formed in june  however  and as such  the year only included six months of operations 
research and development expenses increased  in year  compared with year the increase is primarily due to costs associated with ongoing clinical trials 
during year  the company and its research partners initiated two phase ii trials for argatroban  for ischemic stroke and pci  and a phase i study of tbc for asthma 
our equity in the losses of icos tbc increased  in year compared with year since the partnership was formed in june  year results only included six months of operations 
the increase  however  is primarily due to clinical trials conducted in year in  icos tbc initiated a phase iib iii clinical trial for sitaxsentan as a treatment of pah  and two phase i clinical studies of tbc general and administrative expense increased  in year  compared to year the increase is primarily due to the expenses of revotar  which was formed in june of year investment income increased  in year  due to higher levels of invested funds in the current year 
we received approximately million in proceeds from the exercise of publicly traded warrants in january the effect on investment income of higher availability of funds was partially offset  however  by the lower interest rates which have prevailed during year the interest of the minority shareholders of revotar  who collectively hold approximately of the revotar common stock  increased  in year  compared with  due to higher operating expenses of revotar in as discussed above  revotar was formed in june of year loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle increased  in year  compared with year the increased loss in year is primarily due to i the  in license fee and milestone revenues related to argatroban included in year  discussed above  ii increased research and development costs of  discussed above  iii increased equity in loss of icos tbc  primarily due to increased development costs  discussed above  and iv increased general and administrative costs of  primarily due to the expenses of revotar  as discussed above 
partially offsetting the effect of reduced revenues and increased costs  investment income increased  in year  due to higher levels of available funds  as discussed above 
net loss in year included a charge of  for the cumulative effect  on january   of the change in accounting principle resulting from our adoption of securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
such revenue is being recognized into income over future development periods 
liquidity and capital resources year and at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  investment securities and accrued interest of  compared with  at december  we used  in cash on operating activities in year  compared to cash used by operating activities of  in the primary operating uses of cash in and were to fund our general operating expenses and the ongoing research and development programs conducted by tbc  revotar and icos tbc  reduced by cash received from investment income  milestones  and research payments from our collaborative partners 
investing activities generated  in year  compared with cash used of  in year our capital expenditures declined  in  compared with the cash generated by investing activities during reflects the use of invested funds to finance ongoing operations 
cash generated by financing activities in year was  compared with cash generated in year of  year included proceeds from the exercise of publicly traded warrants in january  for net proceeds of  and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and other warrants for proceeds of  partially reduced by the acquisition of  shares of treasury stock for total proceeds of  during  we generated  in cash from the proceeds of stock option exercises  and the sale of common stock at market price to our new ceo 
material commitments our only material contractual commitments are comprised of a loan commitment to revotar and office and laboratory facility leases 
we and the minority shareholders of revotar have committed to lend revotar approximately million of which our commitment will be approximately million 
the terms of the loans require quarterly interest payments and repayment of all principal on or before april   subject to certain loan provisions regarding profitability or liquidity 
our portion of the loan is denominated in us dollars at an interest rate of seven percent fixed for the first two years and resets to the greater of seven percent or us prime plus two and one half percent on april  it is likely that revotar may need to seek additional funding through collaborative arrangements and or through public or private financings 
the company had long term obligations under our office and laboratory leases as follows in thousands less than contractual obligations total year years years after years operating leases    outlook for in  we expect to have the following results net sales of argatroban by gsk to million revenues to million expenses net of revotar minority interest to million investment income to million estimated net loss to million cash and investments at year end to million in january  icos announced that it had reached a conclusion that joint development of the endothelin receptor antagonist program by icos tbc should not continue 
icos and tbc are currently negotiating the terms pursuant to which tbc could independently continue the program 
the financial terms of this transaction are subject to ongoing negotiations between the two companies 
if we are successful in reaching an agreement  it is likely that we will be responsible for of development expenses incurred after january  related to the endothelin receptor antagonist program  which we believe will be between million and million in a delay in reaching an agreement with icos could adversely affect or delay the development of the endothelin receptor antagonist program 
our estimates of results for will be impacted by the financial terms of the ongoing negotiations between icos and us 
longer term outlook we expect to incur substantial research and development expenditures as we design and develop biopharmaceutical products for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular and other diseases 
we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase in subsequent years because we expect to incur significant expenses in conjunction with additional clinical trial costs for sitaxsentan and research and clinical trial costs for development of bimosiamose compounds and expect to begin to incur costs for clinical trials related to additional compounds 
these costs include hiring personnel to direct and carry out all operations related to clinical trials  hospital and procedural costs  services of a contract research organization  and purchasing and formulating large quantities of the compound to be used in such trials 
there may be additional costs in future periods related to argatroban in complying with ongoing fda requirements and possible clinical trial expenditures for additional therapeutic indications 
our administrative costs and costs to commercialize our products will increase as our products are further developed and marketed 
we have been unprofitable to date and expect to incur operating losses for the next several years as we invest in product research and development  preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory compliance 
we will require substantial additional funding to complete the research and development of our product candidates  to establish commercial scale manufacturing facilities  if necessary  and to market our products 
estimates of our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including market acceptance and commercial success of argatroban  expenses and risks associated with clinical trials to expand the indications for argatroban  continued scientific progress in our drug discovery programs  the magnitude of these programs  progress with preclinical testing and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments and changes in our existing research relationships  our ability to maintain and establish additional collaborative arrangements  and effective commercialization activities and arrangements 
subject to these factors  we anticipate that our existing capital resources and other revenue sources  should be sufficient to fund our cash requirements through year notwithstanding revenues  which may be produced through sales of potential future products  if approved  we anticipate that we will need to secure additional funds to continue the required levels of research and development to reach our long term goals 
we intend to seek such additional funding through collaborative arrangements and or through public or private financings 
in  the stockholders of revotar executed an agreement to provide approximately million in unsecured loans  of which our commitment was approximately million 
under the loan agreement  we have advanced approximately million to revotar during we believe that revotar s existing funds  the remaining commitments under the loan agreement and proceeds under german government scientific grants will be sufficient to fund revotar into the first quarter of in order to continue to operate beyond that time  revotar will need to seek additional funding through collaborative arrangements and or through public or private financings in the future 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements  however we have been obligated to fund our proportionate share of any contractual obligations of icos tbc 
after december   we are responsible for funding of the expenses of icos tbc 
after december   icos tbc is not obligated for any leases  long term debt  or other fixed obligations 
impact of inflation and changing prices the pharmaceutical research industry is labor intensive  and wages and related expenses increase in inflationary periods 
the lease of space and related building services for the houston facility contains a clause that escalates rent and related services each year based on the increase in building operating costs and the increase in the houston consumer price index  respectively 
to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the following describes the nature of this risk that is not believed to be material to us 
we have a majority owned affiliate in berlin  germany and consolidate the results of operations into our consolidated financial results 
although not material to date  our reported expenses and cash flows from this affiliate are exposed to changing exchange rates 
we also have contracts with entities in other areas outside the us that are denominated in a foreign currency 
to date  these currencies have not fluctuated materially 
during  revotar engaged in a program of hedging the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on approximately million in future loan payments from us
