critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to the financial statements 
as disclosed in note of notes to the financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgements and estimates that are used in the preparation of our financial statements 
inventory inventories are priced at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
the company maintains an allowance against inventory for the potential future obsolescence or excess inventory that is based on the company s estimate of future sales 
a substantial decrease in expected demand for the company s products  or decreases in the company s selling prices could lead to excess or overvalued inventories and could require the company to substantially increase its allowance for excess inventory 
revenue recognition the majority of the company s revenue is from sales of the impact test system  which launched at the end of fiscal the company recognizes revenue in the period in which products are shipped  title transferred and acceptance and other criteria are met in accordance with the staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
while the company believes it has met the criteria of sab  due to delays in receiving payments on some of the company s initial shipments of products  the company elected  during the quarter ended december   to begin recording revenue related to shipments only to the extent the related cash has been collected 
during the year ended march   the company had  in product shipments to customers that are subject to customer evaluations and acceptance 
these product shipments are inc luded in finished goods inventory at cost 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers or distribution partners were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
patent and license costs patents are recorded at cost and amortized using the straight line method over the expected useful lives of the patents or years  whichever is less 
cost is comprised of the consideration paid for patents and related legal costs 
if management determines that development of products to which patent cost relate is not reasonably certain or that costs exceed recoverable value  such costs are charged to operations 
license costs are recorded based upon the fair value of consideration paid and amortized using the straight line method over the expected useful life of the underlying patents 
long lived assets the company assesses the recoverability of the affected long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  the company reduces the carrying value of the asset to fair value 
while the company s current and historical operating cash flow losses exceed the assets carrying value  and accordingly  the company has not recognized any impairment losses on long lived assets through march  research and development expenses since the company s inception  virtually all of its activities have consisted of research and development efforts related to developing our impact test system 
the company expenses all such expenditures in the period incurred
