compared to consolidated sales net of intercompany sales were  for the fiscal year ended fye march  this represents a increase over fye sales from usa operations were greater than the prior year by  primarily due to additional surface condenser shipments while maintaining about an equal level of sales in other product categories  and maintaining domestic market share comparable to last year while increasing export sales about over fye the increased sales were due to specific refining and electric power generating projects and not a general recovery in domestic or foreign markets 
sales from uk operations decreased as compared to fye in particular  significant reductions came in sales of pump packages and spare parts 
the reduction in spare part sales is due to fewer replacements purchased by traditional customers 
this is due to significant buying in recent prior years 
the decline in pump package sales is due to the absence of any unusually large order this year 
last year graham precision pumps  ltd 
shipped one order worth about  uk offshore pump sales were up as compared to fye this increase is due to the cost of oil 
when oil sells for a barrel  it is economically feasible to drill offshore 
in addition  several offshore oil projects in eastern russia are developing 
the outlook for continued strength in this market for graham remains positive 
sales of dry pumps in fye were up slightly from fye the company remains bullish on future prospects to sell dry pumps 
the continued legislation in europe tightening environmental requirements will drive this demand 
fye is estimated to be another challenging year  as the markets graham serves are projected to remain flat for at least the first half of fye the consolidated gross profit percentage was as compared to for fye in the usa  the gross profit percentage was as compared to for the prior year 
this decline was due to the colder winter causing higher comfort heating charges  greater defined benefit pension costs due to the three year decline in the stock market and higher product warranty costs 
the gross profit percent in the uk dropped from to this year 
this is attributed to reduced sales volume and fewer sales in offshore spare parts 
spare part sales generate significant profit margins 
it is believed fewer replacement parts were sold because new pumps were purchased instead 
in addition to sales  the gross profit margin in the uk declined due to greater production overhead costs caused by temporary staffing needs 
as a percent of sales  production costs were of sales in fye as compared to in fye selling  general and administrative expenses for the current year were down from last year 
sg a expenses represented of fye sales as compared to for fye the decrease in costs is due to lower variable compensation costs

the company took several actions in the current year to reduce costs 
many of the cost saving steps initiated in fye are expected to be realized in the months and years ahead 
for example  on february   the employee benefits committee of the board of directors irrevocably terminated postretirement medical benefits for current employees of usa operations 
medical benefits paid to retirees of record as of april  are unchanged 
as of march   the accrued postretirement benefits liability remains on the balance sheet without reduction for the actions taken  however  of the accrued amount of  or  does not represent an obligation amount owed to anyone 
the savings gained through curtailing the plan will be recognized for accounting purposes as income over twelve years  starting in the first quarter of fye other steps taken include graham is working toward expanding its standardized products while maintaining its customized products and the company has increased its emphasis on quantifying the costs of product quality and correcting the issues 
compared to consolidated sales net of intercompany sales were  for the year ended march  as compared to sales of  for the prior twelve months 
sales from the usa operation increased about 
surface condenser sales increased about or about  in fiscal year end due to opportunities in the electric power industry 
the power industry includes sales to merchants  cogeneration and independent production facilities 
increased sales in condensers were largely offset by reduced shipments in other product lines 
export shipments  as a percent of total sales  were the lowest they have been since the broad decline in demand for graham s usa products is believed to be temporary 
principal reasons for fewer projects under construction by contractors in the three major segments the company serves refinery  chemical and petrochemical were limited capital spending due to poor global economic conditions  the strong us dollar fye  now eliminated  merger and acquisition activity  revamping of financial infrastructure needs in asia  and caution resulting from the war on terrorism 
sales from uk operations increased about over fye march  or about  significant sales increases were achieved in the categories of liquid ring pump packages  offshore pumps  dry pumps and spares 
the increased sales in pump packages resulted from the shipment of one large order valued at about  to south africa for the petrochemical industry 
going forward  targeting larger orders will be a strategic objective 
in fye graham purchased leybold s dry pump line 
increased dry pump sales in fye was due to further establishing the product line under graham s offerings 
spare part sales increased as a result of the market demand for offshore activity and to the success of the dry pump line 
the consolidated gross profit margin was  down from for the prior year and down from a recent historical range of about 
the uk operations posted a gross profit  up from for the prior year  due to improved product mix 
in fye the uk operations significantly increased their sales in offshore pumps and spares 
these pumps require high quality standards and special fabrication techniques 
accordingly  they bear a higher profit margin 
in the usa the gross profit percent was  down from in fye march the lower gross profit margin was attributed to depressed selling prices together with greater employment costs in the areas of incentive compensation  and medical and workers compensation insurances 
selling  general and administrative expense for the year was about of sales as compared to about for the prior year 
usa costs approximated fye costs 
the increase occurred in the uk and related to greater costs for additional sales personnel and more sales commissions and royalty payments on higher sales 
interest expense for the year decreased from fye bank debt was about of equity  or  at march  as compared to of equity  or  as of march  the provision for income taxes for the year of  approximated statutory rates at as compared to a net tax benefit of  for the fye consolidated net income for the year was  or per diluted share

liquidity and capital resources usa uk usa uk usa uk in thousands of dollars working capital       cash flow from operations   cash and investments    capital expenditures  long term borrowings capital leases compared to consolidated cash flow from operations was  for the year ended march as compared to  for fye cash flow for the current year was greatly enhanced by collection of the unusually large trade accounts receivable balance as of march receivables were substantially greater than normal due to fourth quarter fye significant customer cancellation fees and progress billings 
offsetting the change in the accounts receivable balance of  between march  and were an increase in inventory  a special payment to the defined benefit pension plan and fewer customer deposits 
inventory increased due to the manufacturing stage of usa customer orders  and uk operations increased inventories and short term debt acquiring dry pump gear boxes from a supplier who manufactured them under a make and hold program 
customer deposits decreased  this year as compared to fye due to the reduction of large projects currently in the manufacturing system 
to protect the balance sheet and a bank loan covenant  the company made an additional  payment to the defined benefit pension fund this year 
a fourth item  which reduced working capital this year  was the recognition of  in accruals relating to terminations and retirements 
capital expenditures are estimated to be  next year 
depreciation is estimated to be  compared to consolidated cash flow from operations was  for the year as compared to negative cash flow of  for fye the increase was due to net income of  and other changes in working capital items of  at march  trade account receivables were  up  from march  this increase significantly related to amounts due on cancelled and suspended electric power generating business

surface condensers and special ejectors represent of new orders for the current year as compared to for fye orders in these two categories decreased in total  for the three years ended march  surface condensers and special ejectors averaged of the total usa orders 
decreased new business in condenser products is due to lower demand in the merchant power plant market resulting from an adequate short term electric power supply 
decreased orders in special ejector products is due to weakness in the refinery market  which are attributed to geopolitical concerns in iraq and venezuela 
graham did partially recover from the decline in condenser and special ejector orders with increased activity in vacuum technology products due to  what may be  signs of the beginning of a recovery in the petrochemical market 
the company cannot predict the strength or duration of the recovery 
the company continues to be optimistic about potential orders from chinese petrochemical projects in spite of the sars anxiety that is currently impacting new order opportunities 
uk new orders measured in dollars were up over fye an increase caused by a weakened us dollar in the currency exchange rate played a significant roll in the increase 
in fye  the uk operation introduced a new liquid ring pump design that is more environmentally friendly 
this new product  trade name  ecoseal  resulted in of the new orders in fye the company believes the growth of this product will continue 
as of march   the consolidated backlog was  down from fye the decrease was due to fewer new orders in fye the backlog contains about  in orders that will likely not be shipped in the next twelve months 
one order  valued at  bears cancellation fees if when cancelled 
market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from changes in market rates and prices to which graham is exposed are interest rates foreign exchange rates equity price risk the assumptions applied in preparing quantitative disclosures regarding interest rate  foreign exchange rate and equity price risk are based upon volatility ranges experienced in relevant historical periods  management s current knowledge of the business and market place  and management s judgment of the probability of future volatility based upon the historical trends and economic conditions of the business 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities 
management s strategy for managing risks associated with interest rate fluctuations is to hold interest bearing debt to the absolute minimum and carefully assess the risks and rewards for incurring long term debt 
assuming year ended and variable rate debt  a change in interest rates would impact annual interest expense by  and  respectively 
graham s international consolidated sales exposure for the current year approximated of annual sales as compared to for the year operating in world markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates 
currency movements can affect sales in several ways  the foremost being the ability to competitively compete for orders against competition having a relatively weaker currency 
business lost due to this cannot be quantified 
secondly  cash can be adversely impacted by the conversion of sales in foreign currency to us dollars 
the substantial portion of graham s sales is collected in the seller s currency 
in both and  sales in foreign currencies were of sales 
at certain times  the company may enter into forward foreign exchange agreements to hedge its exposure against unfavorable changes in foreign currency values on significant sales contracts negotiated in foreign currencies 
graham has limited exposure to foreign currency purchases 
in both fye and  purchases in foreign currencies were of cost of goods sold 
at certain times  forward foreign exchange contracts may be utilized to limit currency exposure 
foreign operations resulted in a current year loss of  as compared to income of  for fye as currency exchange rates change  translations of the income statements of the uk business into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
we do not hedge translation risks because cash flows from uk operations are mostly reinvested in the uk 
a change in foreign exchange rates would have impacted the uk reported net income by approximately  for fye and  for the previous year 
the company has a long term incentive plan which provides for awards of share equivalent units seu for outside directors based upon the company s performance 
the outstanding seu s are recorded at fair market value thereby exposing the company to equity price risk 
gains and losses recognized due to market price changes are included in the quarterly results of operations 
based upon the seu s outstanding at march  and and an per share price  a change in the respective year end market price of the company s common stock would positively or negatively impact the company s operating results by  to  for fye and  to  in fye assuming required net income is met  and based upon a market price of the company s stock of per share  a change in the stock price would positively or negatively impact the company s operating results by  to  in   to  in   to  in   to  in and  to  in other matters increases in material and labor costs traditionally have been offset by cost cutting measures and selling price increases 
obtaining price increases are largely a factor of supply and demand for graham s products  whereas inflation factors can originate from influences outside of the company s direct global competition 
graham will continue to monitor the impact of inflation in order to minimize its effects in future years through sales growth  pricing  product mix strategies  purchasing advantageously  productivity improvements  and cost reductions 
the company s usa operations are governed by federal environmental laws  principally the resource conservation and recovery act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  the clean air act  and the clean water act  as well as state counterparts environmental laws 
environmental laws require that certain parties fund remedial actions regardless of fault  legality or original disposal or ownership of the site 
graham is not involved in any environmental remediation projects
