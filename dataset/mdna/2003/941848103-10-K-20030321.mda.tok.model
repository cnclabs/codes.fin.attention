table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates summary the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  waters evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  product returns and allowances  bad debts  inventory valuation  equity investments  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  warranty and installation provisions  contingencies and litigation 
waters bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition sales of products and services are generally recorded based on product shipment and performance of service  respectively 
partial proceeds received in advance of product shipment or performance of service are recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets 
once the product is shipped all advance payments received associated with that particular order are reclassified to accounts receivable to offset against the customer invoice 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order 
the company s products generally carry one year of warranty 
these costs are accrued at the point of shipment 
once the warranty period has expired  the customer may purchase a service contract 
service contract billings are generally invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the contract term  and revenue is amortized on a straight line basis over the contract term 
at december   the company had a deferred revenue liability of million 
product shipments  including those for demonstration or evaluation  and service contracts are not recorded as revenues until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices 
revenues are adjusted accordingly for changes in contract terms or if collectibility is not reasonably assured 
revenue related to installation of certain products is deferred when the product is shipped and recognized when installation is complete 
the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the fair value of the installation service is deferred and recognized under a multiple element arrangement in accordance with sab the company changed its method of revenue recognition for products requiring installation effective january  previously  the company recognized revenue related to both the sale and the installation of certain products at the time of shipment and accrued all associated costs 
estimates of the fair value of installation revenue deferred are based on comparable values from contracts in the same product family where installation is quoted or billed separately 
loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory waters maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
waters does not request collateral from its customers but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit 
the company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  past transaction history with the customer  the credit worthiness of the customer  independent credit reports  industry trends and the macro economic environment 
sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company s accounts receivable balance at december  was million  net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of million 
historically  the company has not experienced significant bad debt losses 
waters values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis fifo 
waters estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence  historical demand  projections of future demand including that in the company s current backlog of orders  and industry and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
the company s inventory balance at december  was million  net of write downs to net realizable value of million 
the company wrote down inventory in by approximately million to reflect decreased net realizable value for mass spectrometry inventory 

table of contents valuation of equity investments waters holds minority equity interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within its strategic focus  some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile share prices 
for investments where the company is not publicly traded  the company obtains and reviews quarterly and annual financial statements and progress of technological expectations 
the company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
in the second quarter and fourth quarter of  the company recorded a million and million charge  respectively  to other expense  in the consolidated statements of operations  for the impairment of certain equity investments 
at december   the company had equity investments totaling million included in other assets on the balance sheet 
long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors the company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant changes or developments in strategic technological collaborations or legal matters which affect the company s capitalized patent  trademark and intellectual properties such as licenses 
when the company determines that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  it measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the company s current business model 
net intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to million as of december  in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  the company ceased amortization of approximately million of goodwill as of december  the company had recorded approximately million of amortization on these amounts during and would have recorded approximately the same amount of amortization in in lieu of amortization  the company was required to perform an initial impairment review of its goodwill in and is required to perform an annual impairment review thereafter 
the company completed its initial review during the first half of and currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that at the time future reviews are completed  a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
warranty product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments 
while waters engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company s previous estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
at december   the company s warranty liability was million 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves the company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  amortization  and inventory reserves  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
the company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 
the company has realized significant income tax benefits associated with the exercise of its nonqualified stock options 
the corresponding credit was to additional paid in capital 
because of the outstanding stock options  the company believes that it is more likely than not that the us deferred tax assets will not be realized  therefore  a valuation allowance has reduced to zero all the deferred tax assets relating to us income 
the remaining net deferred tax assets of million at december  relate to foreign deferred tax assets that are expected to be utilized 

table of contents litigation as described in item of this form k  the company is a party to various pending litigation matters 
with respect to each pending claim  management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and  if so  the probable range of that loss 
if and when management has determined  with respect to a particular claim  both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss  the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss 
the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable interpretation 
with respect to the claims referenced in item  management of the company to date has been able to make both of these determinations  and thus has recorded charges with respect to the claims described under the heading applera corporation  hewlett packard company and environmental legal proceedings 
as developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available  management of the company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range  which may result in its recording charges or additional charges  which could materially impact the company s results of operation or financial position 
recent accounting standards changes in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment to sfas sfas amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
sfas is effective for fiscal years ending after december  with respect to the alternative transition methods permitted and the annual disclosures required 
the disclosure provisions for interim financial information is effective for all periods presented in financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  management has not yet evaluated the alternative transition methods if it were to adopt sfas under this new standard  however  the company has complied with all current disclosure requirements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb  and and rescission of fin fin requires that guarantors recognize a liability for certain types of guarantees equal to the fair value of the guarantee upon its issuance 
fin also requires increased disclosure of guarantees  including product warranty information 
the disclosure provisions of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods that end after december  the provisions for initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after december  the company has adopted the disclosure provisions of fin the company does not expect the application of fin  as it relates to initial recognition and measurement of an obligation  to have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance that the emerging issues task force eitf has set forth in eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the scope of sfas also includes costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease  termination benefits that employees who are involuntarily terminated receive under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract and costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees 
sfas will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  early application is encouraged 
the company does not expect the application of sfas to have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial risk in several areas including changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
the company attempts to minimize its exposures by using certain financial instruments  for purposes other than trading  in accordance with the company s overall risk management guidelines 
further information regarding the company s accounting policies for financial instruments and disclosures of financial instruments can be found in notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements 
foreign exchange the company has operations in various countries and currencies throughout the world 
as a result  the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company uses debt swap agreements and forward foreign exchange contracts to partially mitigate such effects  and these agreements are designated as foreign currency hedges of a net investment in foreign operations 
the debt swap agreements effectively swap higher us dollar fixed rate borrowings for lower fixed rate borrowings denominated in the respective currencies 
during  the company opened and subsequently closed debt swap agreements in japanese yen 
in december  the company entered into new debt swap agreements in japanese yen  with notional amounts totaling million  with terms of three months and an interest rate of 
for the year ended december   the company recorded cumulative net pre tax losses of million in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  which consisted of realized losses of million relating to the closed debt swap agreements and unrealized gains of 
million relating to the new japanese yen swap agreements  both of which partially offset hedged foreign exchange impacts 
in december  the company also opened forward foreign exchange contracts in british pounds with notional amounts totaling million and terms of forty five days 
for the year ended december   the company recorded unrealized gains of 
million in accumulated other comprehensive income loss relating to these forward foreign exchange contracts 
at december   the company held debt swap agreements in japanese yen with notional amounts totaling million  with terms of three months and an interest rate of 
for the year ended december   the company recorded cumulative net pre tax gains of million in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  which consisted of realized gains of million and unrealized gains of million 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change of in year end exchange rates a weakening of the us dollar  the fair market value of the debt swap agreements as of december  would decrease by million 
the company also enters into forward foreign exchange contracts  principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on certain intercompany balances 
principal hedged currencies include the euro and british pound 
the periods of these forward contracts typically range from one to three months and have varying notional amounts which are intended to be consistent with changes in intercompany balances 
gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
at december  and december   the company held forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately million and million  respectively 
interest rates the company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations when borrowing in connection with its credit agreement 
as a result  the company may periodically attempt to minimize its interest rate exposures by using certain financial instruments such as interest swap agreements for the purposes other than trading 
at december  and  there were no outstanding interest swap agreements 
the company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations 
the company s cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments  with original maturities of days or less  in repurchase agreements and money market funds 
cash equivalents are convertible to a known amount of cash and carry an insignificant risk of change in value 
the company periodically maintained balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits
