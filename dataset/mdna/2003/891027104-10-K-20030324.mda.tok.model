item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and r esults of operations cautionary statements 
torchmark cautions readers regarding certain forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and elsewhere in this document  and in any other statements made by  or on behalf of torchmark whether or not in future filings with the securities and exchange commission 
any statement that is not a historical fact  or that might otherwise be considered an opinion or projection concerning torchmark or its business  whether express or implied  is meant as and should be considered a forward looking statement 
such statements represent management s opinions concerning future operations  strategies  financial results or other developments 
forward looking statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties  many of which are beyond torchmark s control 
if these estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect  the actual results of torchmark may differ materially from the forward looking statements made on the basis of such estimates or assumptions 
whether or not actual results differ materially from forward looking statements may depend on numerous foreseeable and unforeseeable events or developments  which may be national in scope  related to the insurance industry generally  or applicable to torchmark specifically 
such events or developments could include  but are not necessarily limited to changing general economic conditions leading to unexpected changes in lapse rates and or sales of torchmark s policies as well as levels of mortality  morbidity and utilization of healthcare services that differ from torchmark s assumptions  regulatory developments  including changes in governmental regulations particularly those impacting taxes and changes to the federal medicare program that would affect medicare supplement insurance and regulatory inquiries regarding industrial life insurance  market trends in the senior aged health care industry that provide alternatives to traditional medicare  such as health maintenance organizations hmos and other managed care or private plans  and that could affect the sales of traditional medicare supplement insurance  interest rate changes that affect product sales and or investment portfolio yield  general economic  industry sector or individual debt issuers financial conditions that may affect the current market value of securities owned by torchmark  or that may impair issuers ability to pay interest due torchmark on those securities  changes in pricing competition  litigation results  levels of administrative and operational efficiencies that differ from torchmark s assumptions  the inability of torchmark to obtain timely and appropriate premium rate increases for health insurance policies due to regulatory delay  the customer response to new products and marketing initiatives  and reported amounts in the financial statements which are based on management s estimates and judgments which may differ from the actual amounts ultimately realized 
readers are also directed to consider other risks and uncertainties described in other documents filed by torchmark with the securities and exchange commission 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and torchmark s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
results of operations summary of operating results 
torchmark s management computes a classification of income called net operating income that it has used consistently over time to evaluate the operating performance of the company 
net operating income is also the corresponding after tax sum of the pretax measures of profit or loss for each of torchmark s reportable segments required to be disclosed in accordance with gaap 
see note business segments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
torchmark s core operations are segmented into insurance underwriting operations and investment operations 
insurance underwriting operations are further segmented into life insurance  health insurance  and annuity products 
the measure of profitability for its insurance segments is underwriting income before other income and administrative expense 
this represents the gross profit margin on insurance products before administrative expenses 
this measure of underwriting income is computed as premium income less net policy obligations  commissions  and acquisition expenses 
insurance segments are further subdivided into component distribution channels which are also evaluated by underwriting income 
the measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income 
excess investment income represents the earnings on the investment portfolio  less the interest required to service net policy liabilities and less the financing costs associated with torchmark s debt and preferred securities 
these designated measures of profitability are highly useful to management in evaluating the performance of the segments and the underlying marketing groups within each insurance segment 
these measures enable management to view period to period trends which are helpful in the determination of future courses of action to be taken 
since net operating income is basically a composite of the results of these operating units  it is a valuable aid to management and to investors in evaluating total corporate trends and performance 
net operating income and other measurements of segment profitability  along with associated ratios  are also used in determining a portion of executive management compensation 
net operating income differs from net income as reported on the income statement because it excludes certain nonoperating items  nonrecurring items  and discontinued operations which must be recorded in the gaap income statement 
these nonoperating items sometimes cause distorted comparisons with prior year results if only net income is considered and financial statements are not taken as a whole 
the differences between net income as reported in torchmark s financial statements and net operating income are as follows realized investment losses  including the realized gains from the adjustment in fair value of torchmark s interest rate swaps  net of tax  the loss from the redemption by torchmark of its monthly income preferred securities mips in the amount of million net of tax in the after tax gain or loss from the redemption of torchmark debt as follows a loss of thousand in  a loss of thousand in  and a gain of thousand in  the effect of the required change to a new accounting principle revising the method for valuing certain asset backed security investments  which resulted in an after tax charge of million in  a one time charge relating to discontinued energy operations in in the amount of million  and the effect of adoption of a new accounting standard which does not permit the amortization of goodwill after net realized investment losses were million in  compared with million in and million in a component of realized investment losses is the gain or loss from adjusting torchmark s interest rate swaps to fair market value at the end of each accounting period as required by accounting rules 
the market value adjustments resulted in pretax gains in each of the three years as follows  million   million  and  million 
during  torchmark wrote down million in fixed maturities due to impairments 
for more information regarding these writedowns and torchmark s policies for evaluating other than temporary impairments  see the discussions of investments on page of this report and critical accounting policies on page torchmark does not consider realized investment gains and losses a component of its core operations and  accordingly  they are not a component of net operating income 
fixed maturities  which comprise of the investment portfolio  are generally held to maturity  but are sometimes sold because of deteriorating credit quality  for tax purposes  or other reasons 
these sales result in gains and losses which can be significant in relation to torchmark s core earnings 
torchmark s core insurance business is very long term in nature  with the realization of actual profits emerging over many years 
including investment gains and losses in net operating income could distort the operating trends 
the charge related to previously discontinued energy operations arose from litigation which was ongoing at the time of torchmark s divestiture of energy activities in this litigation was settled during and resulted in the charge 
more information concerning this matter is found in note commitments and contingencies beginning on page of this report 
effective january   torchmark adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
this statement prohibits goodwill amortization after  but does not allow the restatement of prior periods for comparability when goodwill has been amortized 
instead  after adoption  companies are required to consider goodwill for impairment under a set of guidelines described in the statement 
torchmark tested its goodwill in accordance with the provisions of sfas and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
therefore  torchmark s unamortized goodwill balance at december   in the amount of million  was unchanged in in order to compare operating performance in prior periods with  torchmark has restated net operating income in and to remove the effect of goodwill amortization 
the goodwill amortization charge was million in both and see note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
the redemption of torchmark s debt and mips are discussed under the caption capital resources beginning on page of this report 
because of torchmark s adoption in of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas which amends certain previously issued accounting rules  torchmark will include gains and losses on the redemption of its debt and preferred securities as a component of realized gains and losses in future income statements 
prior periods will be restated for comparability

insurance underwriting income grew in to million but declined to million in a complete discussion of torchmark s insurance operations is found in the discussions of insurance segments beginning on page of this report 
excess investment income grew in both periods 
the increase in excess investment income was due primarily to the decrease in financing costs resulting from the lower interest rate environment in and debt refinancings during the year 
excess investment income rose an additional in as a result of the continued benefit from the lower interest environment and its favorable impact on financing costs from torchmark s interest rate swaps

insurance administrative expenses rose in as a percentage of premium  administrative expense has been stable in each of the past three years at   and in   and  respectively 
the components of torchmark s revenues and operations are described in more detail in the following discussion of insurance and investment segments 
life insurance 
life insurance is torchmark s largest segment 
in  life premium represented of total premium  and life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented of the total 
life insurance premium rose in to billion from billion in life premium increased in from billion 
sales of life insurance  in terms of annualized premium  were million in  increasing over sales of million 
this compares with growth in sales over sales of million 
annualized life premium in force is often indicative of future premium income over the near term 
annualized life premium in force was billion at december   compared with billion at year end  an increase of 
annualized life premium in force grew in from billion at year end annualized life premium in force and issued data includes amounts collected on certain interest sensitive life products which are not recorded as premium income but excludes single premium income and policy account charges 
life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels

at december   direct response life annualized premium in force was of torchmark s total  the largest of any component distribution group 
direct response life insurance annualized premium in force grew in from million 
sales of life insurance in terms of annualized premium issued by direct response were million in  an increase of 
sales declined slightly in to million from million in in early  torchmark discontinued certain products in the direct response market in order to focus on sales of more profitable business 
the discontinuance of sales of these products resulted in the flattening of sales 
the annualized life premium issued by direct response represented of torchmark s total life sales in the liberty national exclusive agency distribution system markets primarily to middle income markets in several southeastern states 
liberty s life premium rose in to million  representing of torchmark s total life premium 
life premium in was million  an increase of over the prior year 
the annualized life premium in force at the liberty agency was million at year end  compared with million and million at year ends and  respectively 
liberty represented of torchmark s total life annualized premium in force at december   compared with a year earlier 
life premium sales for this agency  in terms of annualized premium issued  grew during to million  compared with growth in sales growth in the liberty agency is largely attributable to growth in the number of agents 
liberty s agent count rose to  at year end  after having increased in to  management believes that the continued recruiting of new agents and the retention of productive agents are critical to the continued growth of sales in controlled agency distribution systems 
the american income exclusive agency focuses on members of labor unions  credit unions  and other associations for its life insurance sales 
it is a high profit margin business characterized by lower policy obligation ratios 
this agency was torchmark s fastest growing agency during both and  accounting for the largest growth in both life sales and annualized life premium in force 
annualized life premium in force was million at year end  an increase of over premium in force of million 
annualized life premium in force rose in sales  in terms of annualized premium issued  rose in to million  compared with an increase of in to million 
the rapid growth in sales for this agency over the last three years was a result of the growth in the number of agents 
this agency has grown steadily since the agent count rose in to  agents at year end  grew in to  agents  and further grew to  agents at year end american income s marketing organization continues to implement efforts to improve agent recruiting  retention  and productivity in order to increase the size of this agency 
at december  american income s annualized life premium in force was of torchmark s total  compared with at the end of the previous year 
the american income agency contributed million of life insurance premium income during  an increase of over premium of million 
life premium rose in over the prior year 
torchmark s military agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised of former commissioned and noncommissioned military officers who sell exclusively to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families 
this business consists of whole life products with term insurance riders and is characterized by low lapse rates 
the military agency represented approximately of torchmark s life premium in and life premium in force at december  premium rose in to million  after an increase of to million in annualized premium in force grew to million at year end  compared to an increase of in the prior year 
a major factor in the growth of premium income and premium in force in the military agency is the high persistency associated with military business 
annualized premium issued increased to million in  after having advanced to million in the united american independent and branch office agencies together represented about of torchmark s total life annualized premium in force in on a combined basis  life premium income rose to million in life premium rose in to million from million 
annualized life premium issued in was million  compared with million in and million in annualized life premium in force rose in to million  but was flat in with the prior year at million 
torchmark s other life insurance distribution system consists of the united investors agency and other small miscellaneous sales agencies 
the united investors agency is comprised of several independent agencies 
prior to  united investors distribution was primarily through the sales representatives of a former torchmark subsidiary  waddell reed 
torchmark spun off waddell reed in  and united investors terminated the waddell reed agency contract in life premium income from the other distribution category declined to million in  but increased to million in life premium income from the other distribution group accounted for less than of torchmark s total life insurance premium income in the year annualized life premium in force declined in to million  after having declined to million in annualized premium sold during in the other distribution category was million  a drop of in sales by this agency also declined in by from million in to million 
in addition to life insurance sales  this distribution system has also engaged in the production of variable life collections 
in  collections were million  compared with collections of million  a decline of 
in  these collections had previously declined from the prior year 
although variable life collections are not included in premium in force data  they are included in the variable life account balance 
indirectly  they add to premium revenue through charges to the variable life account balance for insurance coverage and administration 
the account balance is affected by fluctuations in financial markets 
because equity markets were weak in and  the variable life account balance was negatively impacted in both periods 
at december   the variable life account balance was million  declining from the prior year balance of million

margins grew from million in to million in and to million in as a percentage of life insurance premium  life insurance gross margins were in both and  but declined slightly to in there was a slight increase in mortality in compared with the previous two years

health insurance annualized premium in force by product dollar amounts in thousands december  amount of total amount of total amount of total medicare supplement cancer other total premium for the health insurance segment increased to billion in it rose to billion in and to million in annualized health premium in force declined to billion at december  over the previous year end balance of billion 
health premium in force rose in and during sales of health insurance  in terms of annualized premium issued  declined in to million 
in  health sales declined from million to million 
the declines in health sales were attributable to declines in medicare supplement sales in both periods 
medicare supplement sales  in terms of annualized premium issued  fell in to million from million in in  medicare supplement sales were down from million the prior year 
there were three major factors which contributed to these declines 
first  sales in recent years prior to were positively affected by the involuntary terminations of medicare hmo members  which resulted in the disenrollees returning to traditional medicare and medicare supplements 
in  the number of disenrollees reached an unprecedented level 
in  however  these terminations were approximately half of those of the prior year 
in  terminations continued to decline 
the second factor was that medicare supplement sales faced increased premium rate pressure from competition in some markets 
torchmark implemented premium rate increases on its medicare supplement policies on a more timely basis than some competitors during these periods 
management believes that these competitive pressures will subside as competitors obtain necessary rate increases 
torchmark plans to seek lower rate increases in than in recent years on this business which may improve its competitive position 
third  in addition to the increased competition  the number of producing agents at the united american branch office agency declined in as agents in some markets left for easier sales at those competitors whose medicare supplement products were priced lower than torchmark s 
prior to  this agency had experienced rapid growth in appointed agents  which contributed greatly to the growth in sales in these periods 
medicare supplement policies are highly regulated at both the federal and state levels with standardized benefit plans  limits on first year agent compensation  and mandated minimum loss ratios 
however  they remain a popular supplemental health policy with the country s large and growing group of medicare beneficiaries 
about of all medicare beneficiaries have medicare supplements to cover at least some portion of the deductibles and coinsurance for which the federal medicare program does not pay 
because of loss ratio regulation  underwriting margins on medicare supplements are lower than those on torchmark s life business 
however  due to united american s low cost  service oriented customer service and claims administration  as well as its economies of scale  it is a profitable line of business 
other regulatory issues continue to affect the medicare supplement market 
medical cost inflation and changes to the medicare program necessitate annual rate increases  which generally require state insurance department approval 
in addition  congress and the executive branch have begun studying ways to restructure the medicare program 
therefore  it is likely that changes will be made to the medicare program at sometime in the future 
however  it appears that there will continue to be an important role for private insurers in helping senior citizens cover their healthcare costs 
as a result  medicare supplements should continue as a popular product for senior age consumers 
medicare supplement insurance is sold primarily by the united american branch office agency and the united american independent agency 
medicare supplement sales in both agencies have declined in both and as a result of the decline in hmo disenrollees  the increased competition  and the loss in the number of agents 
at the end of  the number of producing agents was  and declined to  at year end in terms of annualized health premium issued  health sales for the branch office agency were million in  declining from sales of million in health sales in declined from sales of million in the independent agency sold million  million  and million in each of the years   and  respectively 
this represents a decline of in but an increase of in while medicare supplement sales in this agency declined in  increases in sales of other limited benefit health products  as discussed below  have more than offset the declines 
cancer insurance premium in force rose in to million 
it was flat in with premium in force of million in both and sales of this product were up in to million 
sales rose in to million from million 
a portion of the growth in cancer annualized premium in force has been attributable to premium rate increases to offset increased health care costs 
cancer insurance products are sold primarily by the liberty national exclusive agency 
this agency represented of torchmark s total cancer annualized premium in force at december  sales of other limited benefit health products more than doubled in  increasing from million in to million in sales of these products previously increased in over the prior year 
annualized premium in force for other health products grew in to million  after rising in to million 
the united american agencies have offered limited benefit plans for many years 
the majority of the recent increases in sales were written by the united american independent agency 
most of the plans being written are limited benefit hospital and surgical plans that are lower cost alternatives to individual major medical plans  or that are bought to supplement employer sponsored group health plans 
increased demand for these plans is the result of the growing unavailability of individual major medical plans and decreased coverage offered by employers 
because of the limits on maximum benefits and other limits  these type plans are less subject to high rate increases that have been experienced in major medical type plans 
from a regulatory standpoint  these type plans generally require lower minimum loss ratios than medicare supplements  but they do experience slightly higher lapse rates 
health insurance summary of results dollar amounts in thousands amount of premium amount of premium amount of premium premium policy obligations required interest on reserves net policy obligations commissions and premium taxes amortization of acquisition costs required interest on deferred acquisition costs total expense insurance underwriting income before other income and administrative expenses health insurance underwriting income before other income and administrative expense declined in from million to million 
in  health underwriting income rose from million in as a percentage of premium  underwriting income before other income and administrative expense declined in both and from their respective prior years 
the decreases in margins were caused primarily by increased policy obligations in a closed block of cancer policies and slightly higher acquisition costs in the united american agencies 
annuities 
annuities are sold on both a fixed and variable basis 
fixed annuity deposits are held and invested by torchmark and are obligations of the company 
variable annuity deposits are invested at the policyholder s direction into his choice among a variety of mutual funds  which vary in degree of investment risk and return 
a fixed annuity investment account is also available as a variable annuity investment option 
investments pertaining to variable annuity deposits are reported as separate account assets and the corresponding deposit balances for variable annuities are reported as separate account liabilities 
annuity products are marketed by torchmark to service a variety of needs  including retirement income and long term  tax deferred growth opportunities 
prior to  torchmark s annuities were sold primarily by the waddell reed sales force  which marketed united investors products under a marketing agreement 
in  this sales force collected of torchmark s total annuity collections 
effective april   torchmark terminated the marketing agreement providing for the sale of torchmark s variable annuities by the waddell reed sales force 
waddell reed was a former subsidiary of torchmark which was spun off in but is no longer affiliated 
in addition to no longer marketing united investors products  waddell reed has been replacing united investors products with those of another carrier 
as a result  torchmark has experienced declines in annuity sales and deposit balances 
on march   an alabama jury awarded united investors million in compensatory damages against waddell reed 
the dispute resulting in the litigation arose regarding certain compensation on united investors in force block of variable annuities and alleged a scheme by waddell reed to improperly replace united investors variable annuities with those of another company 
on june   an order was issued by the jefferson county alabama circuit court entering the jury verdict 
interest on the million award will accrue at an annual rate of from june  until the date paid 
waddell reed has appealed the circuit court s decision to the alabama supreme court 
in october   the alabama supreme court affirmed the dismissal of counterclaims against torchmark and an individual defendant but waddell reed s appeal from the jury verdict and trial court judgment remains pending 
united investors will not record the award or the related accrued interest as income until it is received  which will not occur until all appeals are completed 
in addition  united investors request for injunctive relief to prohibit future improper policy replacements by waddell reed was denied by the circuit court  which specified that united investors has the right to bring additional litigation against waddell reed 
torchmark is now marketing the variable annuities of united investors through other broker dealers 
in addition  a small amount of fixed annuities are sold by the united american independent agency and the liberty national agency 
while torchmark continues to sell annuity products  it does not expect to emphasize this product line in the future 
annuity premium is added to the annuity account balance as a deposit and is not reflected in income 
revenues on both fixed and variable annuities are derived from charges to the annuity account balances for insurance risk  administration  and surrender  depending on the structure of the contract 
variable accounts are also charged an investment fee and a sales charge 
torchmark benefits to the extent these policy charges exceed actual costs and  on fixed annuity policies  to the extent actual investment income exceeds the investment income which is credited to the policy 
the following table presents the annuity account balance at each year end and the annuity collections for each year for both fixed and variable annuities 
annuity deposit balances annuity collections dollar amounts in millions dollar amounts in thousands fixed variable total collections of fixed annuity premium almost doubled in at million  compared with million in fixed annuity premium collections declined in from million in the fixed annuity deposit balance rose to million at year end from million at year end this increase reversed the decline of in to million at year end from million at year end during and  torchmark had experienced weaker sales as a result of the reduced sales force and its reduced emphasis of annuity products 
in  weaker financial markets caused increased customer interest in fixed annuities and resulted in some transfers of variable annuity customers to fixed products 
variable annuity collections declined in to million from million in variable collections had previously declined from million in the variable annuity account balance declined in to billion at december  from billion at december  it declined in from billion at december  the loss of the waddell reed sales force  the replacement activity by waddell reed  and the weaker financial markets have been major factors in the declines in variable annuity sales and the variable annuity deposit balance in both and variable accounts are valued based on the market values of the underlying securities 
annuities summary of results dollar amounts in thousands policy charges policy obligations required interest on reserves net policy obligations commissions and premium taxes amortization of acquisition costs required interest on deferred acquisition costs total expense insurance underwriting income before other income and administrative expenses annuity underwriting income before other income and administrative expense declined from million in to million in it declined from million in the declines in annuity underwriting income resulted from the declines in the annuity account balance in each period 
policy charges rose in to million before dropping in to million 
policy charges are generally based on the size of the annuity account balance 
in  policy charges increased despite declining account balances because of surrender charges generated by the waddell reed replacement activity 
however  the replacements caused an increase in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs which reduced underwriting income 
the reduced variable annuity sales and replacement activity continued in and  along with the weaker financial markets  resulted in the lower variable annuity account size and overall lower annuity underwriting income 
investments 
the following table summarizes torchmark s investment income and excess investment income 
analysis of excess investment income dollar amounts in thousands except for per share data net investment income tax equivalency adjustment tax equivalent investment income required interest on net insurance policy liabilities interest on reserves interest on deferred acquisition costs net required financing costs excess investment income excess investment income per diluted share mean invested assets at amortized cost average net insurance policy liabilities average debt and preferred securities at amortized cost excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations and cash flow management 
it is the measure that management uses to evaluate the performance of the investment segment 
it is defined as net investment income on a tax equivalent basis reduced by the interest cost credited to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or financing costs 
net investment income rose to million in in  net investment income increased to million after having increased in on a tax equivalent basis  in which the yield on tax exempt securities is adjusted to produce a yield equivalent to the pretax yield on taxable securities  investment income rose in tax equivalent investment income rose in and increased in the increase in both and was caused by the growth in mean invested assets  which rose during each year to billion in and billion in mean invested assets are computed on the basis of book value 
the average tax equivalent yield on the portfolio stabilized in at 
the average yield declined approximately basis points during to from  since rates have generally declined on investments acquired during this period 
this decline in yield partially offset the benefit to net investment income from the larger asset base in the growth in mean invested assets was achieved in both and even though million and million were used to buy back torchmark stock under its ongoing share repurchase program in and  respectively 
new cash flow was invested primarily in taxable fixed maturity securities in both and these securities consisted primarily of investment grade corporate bonds and trust preferred securities 
as a result  the mean taxable fixed maturity balance has grown in each year  rising in to billion and in to billion 
excess investment income grew in to million 
it previously increased in and in because excess investment income is a measure of the efficient use of cash flow  and cash has been used for share purchases  excess investment income should be viewed on a per share basis 
excess investment income per diluted share increased in to per share 
it increased in and in the growth in excess investment income in both and resulted in large part from the reductions in financing costs through the lower interest rate environment and the redemption of the mips during in  torchmark reduced financing costs by million through the swap agreements on its debt and preferred security instruments  accounting for the majority of the growth in excess investment income 
these agreements reduced financing costs by million in it is torchmark s investment strategy to maintain a positive spread between yields on new investments and the company s required yield on policy and financing costs 
to accomplish this  the company invests new cash primarily in corporate investment grade quality fixed maturity bonds 
in periods of lower than historically normal interest rates  such as experienced in recent years  torchmark maintained its yield spread by purchasing longer maturities 
because the majority of torchmark s liabilities are its policy liabilities  which have fixed interest rates and are very long term  torchmark does not experience negative asset and liability matching by extending investment maturities 
torchmark s investment results indicate this strategy is effective even in periods of low rates  but the company expects to benefit as rates eventually rebound 
funds generated annually from insurance operations as well as those from the investment portfolio exceed the total of floating rate liabilities  and reinvestment at higher rates should result in a positive benefit to excess investment income 
in  new investments in fixed maturities totaled billion  compared with billion in and billion in while principal and interest available for commitment are rather stable  investments from year to year can fluctuate due to the extent of tax driven sales or  infrequently  from portfolio restructurings 
acquisitions in were made at an effective compounded yield of  compared with an effective compounded yield of in and in these yields equate to nominal yields on acquisition of   and in those years  respectively 
acquisitions in had an average life of years  little changed from years in and higher than years in at the close of  the fixed maturity portfolio had a tax equivalent book yield of  virtually the same as the portfolio yield of the previous year and slightly less than at the end of the portfolio average life increased to years at year end  compared with years at the end of both yield and average life calculations are based on the maturity date  or for callable bonds  the call or the maturity date whichever produces the lowest yield yield to worst 
at december   approximately of invested assets were held in fixed maturity securities 
the major rating agencies considered approximately of the portfolio to be investment grade 
the average quality of the portfolio continues to be a 
the investment strategy of the company is to purchase only investment grade obligations 
the increase in below investment grade issues were the result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings 
during  torchmark wrote down several individual holdings to estimated fair value as a result of other than temporary impairment 
the impaired securities met some or all of torchmark s criteria for other than temporary impairment as discussed in its critical accounting policies on page of this report 
in total  eleven individual issues with combined book values of million were written down to million  creating a pre tax charge of million 
bonds of eight of the issuers were held at year end 
five of these issuers were delinquent in interest payments

during  torchmark adopted a new accounting principle  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interest in securitized financial assets eitf  which changed the method of accounting for certain of its asset backed securities 
as a result of the requirements of the new principle  torchmark wrote these investments down million  or million net of tax  which has been reported as a change in accounting principle 
subsequent to adoption  impairments of these assets have been and will be reported as realized investment losses

credit risk sensitivity 
credit risk is the level of certainty that a security s issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity 
in the past two years  due to the economic downturn and other factors  the securities of many industry sectors especially affected have suffered increased credit risk 
as a result  many securities have been downgraded by credit rating agencies to below investment grade status 
thus  the likelihood the issuers will honor their securities terms has been reduced and the securities market values have been impaired 
as torchmark continues to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities  credit risk is a concern 
torchmark mitigates this ongoing risk  in part  by only acquiring investment grade bonds  and also by investigating the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer 
the table below demonstrates the credit rankings of torchmark s fixed income portfolio 
rating amount in thousands aaa aa a bbb bb b less than b not rated torchmark reduces credit risk by maintaining investments in a wide range of industry sectors 
the following table presents the highest ten percentage holdings of torchmark s corporate fixed maturities by industry sector at december  industry depository institutions electric  gas  sanitation services insurance carriers nondepository credit institutions finance communications chemicals allied products food kindred products transportation equipment industrial  commercial machinery  computer equipment rubber miscellaneous plastics products otherwise  no individual industry represented or more of torchmark s corporate fixed maturities 
market risk sensitivity 
market risk is the risk that the value of a security will change because of a change in market conditions 
torchmark s primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk  which is the risk that a change in a security s value could occur because of a change in interest rates 
this risk is significant to torchmark s investment portfolio because its fixed maturity holdings amount to of total investments 
the effects of interest rate fluctuations on fixed investments are reflected on an after tax basis in torchmark s shareholders equity because these investments are marked to market value under sfas the actual interest rate risk to torchmark is reduced because the effect that changes in rates have on assets is offset by the effect they have on insurance liabilities and on debt 
interest assumptions are used to compute the majority of torchmark s insurance liabilities 
these insurance liabilities  net of deferred acquisition costs  were billion and debt and preferred securities were 
billion at december   compared with fixed maturity investments of billion at amortized cost at the same date 
because of the long term nature of insurance liabilities  temporary changes in value caused by rate fluctuations have little bearing on ultimate obligations 
in accordance with gaap  insurance liabilities and debt are generally not marked to market 
market risk is managed in a manner consistent with torchmark s investment objectives 
torchmark seeks to maintain a portfolio of high quality fixed maturity assets that may be sold in response to changing market conditions 
however  it is torchmark s primary objective to hold securities to maturity 
torchmark s strong operating cash flow and stable  long term policy liabilities decrease the likelihood of needing to sell fixed investments for operating liquidity 
some sales may be made to preserve capital due to changes in credit quality of individual securities or for tax purposes 
potential volatility in the value of torchmark s longer term fixed maturity holdings is reduced by the company s practice of holding securities to maturity  which has resulted in of the fixed portfolio being expected to repay within five years and within ten years 
also  the portfolio and market conditions are constantly evaluated for appropriate action 
no derivative instruments are used to manage torchmark s exposure to market risk in the investment portfolio 
interest rate swap instruments have been entered into by torchmark in connection with its preferred stock and certain debt issues as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements on page of this report and in capital resources beginning on page of this report 
the liability for torchmark s insurance policy obligations is computed using interest assumptions  some of which are contractually guaranteed 
a reduction in market interest rates of a permanent nature could cause investment return to fall below guaranteed amounts 
torchmark s insurance companies participate in the cash flow testing procedures imposed by statutory insurance regulations  the purpose of which is to insure that such liabilities are adequate to meet the company s obligations under a variety of interest rate scenarios 
those procedures indicate that torchmark s insurance policy liabilities  when considered in light of the assets held with respect to such liabilities and the investment income expected to be received on such assets  are adequate to meet the obligations and expenses of torchmark s insurance activities in all but the most extreme circumstances 
the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of torchmark s interest rate sensitive fixed maturity portfolio at december    and this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of torchmark s fixed maturity portfolio 
the data is prepared through a model which incorporates various assumptions and estimates to measure the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of basis points 
it takes into account the effect that special option features such as call options  put options  and unscheduled repayments could have on the portfolio  given the changes in rates 
the valuation of these option features is dependent upon assumptions about future interest rate volatility that are based on past performance 
market value of fixed maturity portfolio millions change in interest rates in basis points at december  at december  financial condition liquidity 
liquidity provides an institution such as torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations 
torchmark s liquidity is derived from three sources positive cash flow from operations  portfolio of marketable securities  and a line of credit facility 
torchmark s insurance operations have historically generated positive cash flows in excess of its immediate needs 
cash flows provided from operations increased in each of the three years ended december  over their respective prior year 
they were million in  compared with million in and million in in addition to operating cash flows  torchmark received million in investment maturities and repayments during  adding to available cash flows 
such repayments were million in and million in cash flows in excess of immediate requirements are used to build an investment base to fund future requirements 
available cash flows are also used to repay debt  to buy back torchmark shares  to pay shareholder dividends  and for other corporate uses 
while torchmark s cash flows have historically been positive and very strong  a reduction in cash flow could negatively affect its liquidity 
torchmark s cash and short term investments were million at year end and million at year end in addition to these highly liquid assets  torchmark has a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale should the need arise 
these securities had a value of billion at december  torchmark has in place a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and stand by letters of credit up to million 
the facility is split into two parts a million day tranche maturing november   and a million five year tranche maturing november  the company has the ability to request up to million in letters of credit to be issued against the million five year tranche 
under either tranche  interest is charged at variable rates 
the line of credit is further designated as a back up credit line for a commercial paper program not to exceed million  whereby torchmark may borrow from either the credit line or issue commercial paper at any time 
commercial paper borrowings and letters of credit on a combined basis may not exceed million 
at december   million face amount of commercial paper was outstanding  million letters of credit were issued  and there were no borrowings under the line of credit 
a facility fee is charged on the entire million facility 
the facility does not contain any ratings based acceleration triggers which would require early repayment 
in accordance with the agreements  torchmark is subject to certain covenants regarding capitalization and earnings 
at december   torchmark was in full compliance with these covenants 
liquidity of the parent company is affected by the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends 
the parent receives dividends from subsidiaries in order to meet dividend payments on common and preferred stock  interest and principal repayment requirements on parent company debt  and operating expenses of the parent company 
dividends from insurance subsidiaries of torchmark are limited to the greater of statutory net gain from operations  excluding capital gains and losses  on an annual noncumulative basis  or of surplus  in the absence of special approval 
distributions are not permitted in excess of statutory net worth 
subsidiaries are also subject to certain minimum capital requirements 
although these restrictions exist  dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been and is expected to be more than adequate to meet the cash flow needs for parent company operations 
during the year  a maximum amount of million is expected to be available to torchmark from insurance subsidiaries without regulatory approval 
capital resources 
in the use of financial measures and ratios to evaluate its use of capital resources  torchmark s management adjusts shareholders equity to remove the effect caused by changes in the interest rates in the financial markets 
torchmark has a large available for sale fixed maturity portfolio and is required by an accounting rule sfas to revalue the portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period 
these changes in value  net of tax  are reflected directly in shareholders equity 
because the size of torchmark s fixed maturity portfolio is very large relative to shareholders equity  and because small changes in interest rates can cause huge swings in market value  torchmark s shareholders equity as reported in accordance with gaap can be volatile 
this volatility can distort the measure of torchmark s capital structure  as the short term changes in the value of its fixed maturity investment portfolio have little bearing on its long term ongoing insurance business 
for this reason  this interest based market adjustment is removed from shareholders equity and related ratios to provide management and investors a clearer picture of torchmark s shareholders equity 
a reconciliation of shareholders equity excluding sfas with shareholders equity is as follows amounts in millions shareholders equity excluding sfas sfas adjustment shareholders equity most directly comparable gaap financial measure torchmark s capital structure consists of long and short term debt  preferred securities  and shareholders equity 
torchmark s debt consists of its funded debt and its commercial paper facility 
an analysis of torchmark s funded debt outstanding at year ends and at par value is as follows instrument year due rate principal amount thousands principal amount thousands senior debentures notes notes senior notes total funded debt the carrying value of the funded debt was million at december   compared with million a year earlier 
in accordance with accounting rules  torchmark carries the senior notes at fair value since they are backed by derivatives that qualify as a hedge 
this market value increase accounted for million of the increase in the carrying value of total funded debt 
torchmark issued million principal amount of senior notes in december  these notes will mature on december  and may not be redeemed prior to maturity 
there is no sinking fund requirement 
interest is payable semi annually on june and december these notes are unsecured and rank equally with torchmark s other unsecured indebtedness 
proceeds from the issuance  after underwriters discount and expenses of the offering  were approximately million 
proceeds were used initially to pay down short term debt 
in connection with this issuance  torchmark entered into a five year swap agreement with an unaffiliated party to swap the fixed rate payment obligation for a floating rate obligation 
the floating rate is based on the six month libor and resets every six months 
at december   the floating rate was 
the swap arrangement added million net of tax to torchmark s net operating income 
this swap derivative qualifies as a hedge under accounting rules 
therefore  changes in its market value are substantially offset by changes in the value of the debt security 
torchmark s derivative instruments are classified as other invested assets 
in  torchmark acquired thousand principal amount of its notes due at a cost of thousand  resulting in a thousand loss on debt redemption after tax 
in  million par value of the notes was acquired by torchmark at a cost of million  resulting in an after tax loss of thousand 
in  million principal amount of torchmark notes and million principal amount of the notes were acquired at a cost of million and million  respectively 
the redemption of this debt in resulted in an after tax gain of thousand 
in november   torchmark established two capital trusts which in turn sold trust preferred securities in a public offering 
capital trust i sold million shares and capital trust ii sold million shares 
the trust preferreds sold in the two offerings have identical terms 
each offering consisted of trust preferreds at a liquidation amount of per security  resulting in an aggregate liquidation amount of million 
they are redeemable at torchmark s option in part or whole at any time on or after november  they are subject to a mandatory redemption on november  distributions are cumulative and are paid quarterly at an annual rate of  or at a rate of per share 
all payments by the trusts regarding the trust preferreds are guaranteed by torchmark 
the capital trusts are wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries of torchmark 
the two offerings resulted in proceeds to the capital trusts of million  after underwriters discount and issue expenses 
the capital trusts used the proceeds to buy junior subordinated debentures from torchmark in like amount 
torchmark used these proceeds to redeem the remaining million of outstanding mips and to pay down short term debt 
in conjunction with the offering of the trust preferred securities  torchmark entered into a ten year swap agreement to replace the fixed distribution obligation with a floating rate payment 
the floating rate is based on the three month libor and resets each quarter when the distributions are made 
the trust preferred swap rate is set in arrears each quarter 
therefore it is estimated at the end of each accounting period 
at december   the variable rate was 
this swap derivative does not qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes and is carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair market value 
at december   this swap was valued at a gain of million before tax 
torchmark s net operating income was increased million in as a result of the swap 
the mips were originally issued in at a redemption amount of million with a monthly dividend based on an annual rate of 
the mips were redeemable at torchmark s option at any time after september  at the full redemption amount of per share 
torchmark elected to redeem the mips in full during in three transactions which resulted in an after tax loss on redemption of million 
funds to repay million of the principal amount were derived from the issuance of the trust preferred securities in november   while the remaining million balance was redeemed using corporate cash flow or by short term borrowings earlier in the year 
torchmark has a swap agreement  originally entered into when the mips were issued  to exchange a monthly fixed payment based on an annual rate of for a floating rate based on the one month libor rate on a notional amount of million 
while the mips have been redeemed  the swap is still in place and does not expire until september  at december   torchmark was obligated to pay at a floating rate of on this agreement  while collecting at a rate of 
torchmark s net operating income benefited million in  million in  and million in because of this swap agreement 
at december   this swap was carried at its fair market value of million 
short term debt consists of torchmark s commercial paper outstanding 
the commercial paper balance outstanding at december  was million at carrying value  compared with a balance of million a year earlier 
the commercial paper borrowing balance fluctuates based on torchmark s current needs 
the following table presents information about torchmark s debt to capitalization 
as discussed on page  torchmark removes the effect of fluctuations in shareholders equity resulting from changes in interest rates caused by accounting rule sfas management believes the debt to capitalization ratio excluding sfas provides a more meaningful presentation of torchmark s capitalization 
in addition  lending banks require that the capitalization ratios specified in the debt covenants concerning torchmark s short term debt agreements be computed on the basis excluding sfas debt to capitalization is also presented whereby preferred securities are included as either equity or debt

the decline also resulted from much lower interest rates in financial markets and a reduction in average debt outstanding 
under its share repurchase program  torchmark continues to make share purchases in the open market when market conditions are favorable 
in  torchmark acquired million shares at a cost of million 
purchases of million shares at a cost of million were made in and million shares were acquired at a cost of million in torchmark plans to continue to make share purchases when prices are attractive 
in each of the years and  torchmark executed stock option exercise and restoration programs whereby torchmark employees and directors exercised vested stock options and received a reduced number of new options at the current market price 
while these programs resulted in the issuance of new shares  a substantial portion of the new shares were sold immediately by the participants in the open market to cover the cost of the purchased shares and the related minimum taxes 
as a result of these restoration programs  management s ownership interest increased  and torchmark received a current tax benefit from the exercise of the options 
the following table presents key information about the programs

as discussed on page  the removal of sfas eliminates the volatility in book value caused by interest rate fluctuations in financial markets that have little bearing on torchmark s ongoing operations

contractual commitments 
a schedule of torchmark s scheduled contractual commitments for the next five years at december  is as follows 
millions thereafter short term debt long term debt preferred stock operating lease obligations total other items litigation 
torchmark and its subsidiaries continue to be named as parties to pending or threatened litigation  much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at liberty in alabama 
such punitive damage claims are tried in alabama state courts where any punitive damage litigation may have the potential for significant adverse results since punitive damages in alabama are based upon the compensatory damages including mental anguish awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined 
additionally  it should be noted that torchmark subsidiaries actively market insurance in the state of mississippi  a jurisdiction which is nationally recognized for large punitive damage verdicts 
bespeaking caution is the fact that it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case 
it is thus difficult to predict with certainty the liability of torchmark or its subsidiaries in any given case because of the unpredictable nature of this type of litigation 
based upon information presently available  and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries  contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by management to be material

new accounting rules rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections fasb statement no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  this statement supersedes previous accounting rules regarding debt extinguishments and certain lease modifications 
it prohibits reporting gains and losses from debt extinguishments as extraordinary on the income statement unless it is material  infrequent  and unusual 
it requires reclassification of such amounts previously classified as extraordinary into continuing operations 
as a result  torchmark s gains and losses from the purchase of its debt and preferred securities will be included upon adoption as a component of realized gains and losses on the income statement  with prior periods reclassified 
torchmark had pretax losses of thousand on debt redemptions and million from the redemption of its mips in in  the loss from debt redemptions was thousand pretax 
the provisions regarding leases are immaterial to torchmark 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fasb statement no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
statement amends previous accounting standards to require the recognition of a liability for the cost associated with an exit or disposal activity at the time the liability is incurred 
previously  this liability was recognized at the time of commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of this statement should have no material impact on torchmark 
critical accounting policies future policy benefits 
because of the long term nature of insurance contracts  torchmark s insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future 
the liability for future policy benefits represents estimates of the present value of torchmark s insurance subsidiaries expected benefit payments  net of the related present value of future net premium collections 
it is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry  using assumptions as to mortality life expectancy  morbidity health expectancy  persistency  and interest rates  which are based on torchmark s previous experience with similar products 
for the majority of torchmark s insurance products  the assumptions used were those considered to be appropriate at the time the policies were issued 
an additional provision is made on most products to allow for possible adverse deviation from the assumptions assumed 
for insurance products considered to be interest sensitive or deposit balance type products  the assumptions are monitored on a regular basis and modified when it is determined that actual experience is different from that previously assumed 
while management and company actuaries have used their best judgment in determining the assumptions and in calculating the liability for future policy benefits  there is no assurance that the estimate of the liabilities reflected in the financial statements represents torchmark s ultimate obligation 
additionally  significantly different assumptions could result in materially different reported amounts 
a complete list of the assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in note future policy benefits reserves in the notes to consolidated financial statements found on page of this report 
deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased 
the costs of acquiring new business are generally deferred and recorded as an asset on the balance sheet 
deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs of new insurance sales 
additionally  the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other companies are also deferred and recorded as assets under the caption value of insurance purchased 
deferred acquisition costs are amortized in a systematic manner which matches these costs with the associated revenues 
the assumptions used to amortize acquisition costs with regard to interest  mortality  morbidity  and persistency are consistent with those used to estimate the liability for future policy benefits 
for interest sensitive and deposit balance type products  these assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis and are revised if actual experience differs significantly from original expectations 
deferred acquisition costs are subject to periodic recoverability and loss recognition testing 
these tests ensure that the present value of future contract related cash flows will support the capitalized deferred acquisition cost asset 
these cash flows consist primarily of premium income  less benefits and expenses taking inflation into account 
the present value of these cash flows  less the benefit reserve  is then compared with the unamortized deferred acquisition cost balance 
in the event the estimated present value of net cash flows is less  this deficiency would be charged to expense as a component of amortization and the asset balance is reduced by a like amount 
different assumptions with regard to deferred acquisition costs could produce materially different amounts of amortization 
for more information about accounting for deferred acquisition costs see note significant accounting policies and note deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased in the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages and of this report  respectively 
policy claims and other benefits payable 
this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the company 
the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience 
torchmark management makes an estimate after careful evaluation of all information available to the company 
however  there is no certainty the stated liability for claims and other benefits  including the estimate of unsubmitted claims  will be torchmark s ultimate obligation 
revenue recognition 
premium income for torchmark s subsidiaries insurance contracts is generally recognized as the premium is collected 
however  in accordance with gaap  revenue on limited payment contracts and universal life type contracts deposit balance products are recognized differently 
revenues on limited payment contracts are recognized over the contract period 
premium for deposit balance products  such as torchmark s annuity and interest sensitive life policies  is added to the policy account value 
the policy account value or deposit balance is a torchmark liability 
this deposit balance is then charged a fee for the cost of insurance  administration  surrender  and certain other charges which are recognized as revenue in the period the fees are charged to the policyholder 
in each case  benefits and expenses are matched with revenues in a manner by which they are incurred as the revenues are earned 
investment income is reported as revenue by torchmark when it is earned less investment expenses 
the investment activities of torchmark are integral to its insurance operations

impairment of investments 
torchmark continually monitors its investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value 
while the values of the investments in torchmark s portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions  an investment is considered to be impaired only when it has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed other than temporary permanent 
in accordance with gaap  a permanently impaired investment is written down to fair value 
the determination that a security is permanently impaired is highly subjective 
many factors are taken into account including default on a payment issuer has declared bankruptcy severe deterioration in market value deterioration in credit quality as indicated by credit ratings issuer having serious financial difficulties as reported in the media these and other factors are analyzed  and if a security is considered to be permanently impaired  it is written down to the fair value 
the writedown is recognized as a realized investment loss 
while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available  it is difficult to predict the ultimate recoverable amount of a distressed or impaired security 
defined benefit pension plans 
torchmark maintains funded defined benefit plans covering most full time employees 
it also has unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees 
torchmark s obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions 
in accordance with gaap  an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time 
these obligations are offset by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans 
torchmark s pension cost for the defined benefit plans was million  million  and million in each of the years   and  respectively 
the actuarial assumptions used in determining torchmark s obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover  retirement age  the expected return on plan assets  projected salary increases  and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled 
these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation 
a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in torchmark s pension obligation 
a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation 
these assumptions are subjective in many cases and small changes in certain assumptions may cause material differences in reported results 
while management has used its best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions  given the information available from company experience  economic data  independent consultants and other sources  no assurance can be given that actual results will be the same as expected 
torchmark s discount rate  rate of return on assets  and projected salary increase assumptions are disclosed in note postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements on page of this report 
in order to remove volatility in the changes in the market values of plan investments from year to year  gaap permits and torchmark utilizes a market related value whereby changes in the market values of investments are recognized systematically over a moving five year period 
additionally  the difference in the pension obligation arising from actual results versus the expected results using actuarial assumptions is generally not recognized in the current period 
pension cost in future periods is affected by the amount of unrecognized gain or loss in market value and actuarial estimates 
an unrecognized gain will reduce future cost and an unrecognized loss will increase future costs 
at december   torchmark had an unrecognized actuarial loss of million 
torchmark makes cash contributions to the funded plans from time to time subject to mandatory required minimums and internal revenue service allowed maximums for tax deductibility 
these contributions were million  million  and 
million in each of the years   and  respectively 
assets in the funded plans are placed in a diversified mix of investments 
at december  the composition of investments at fair value was as follows amount corporate debt other fixed maturities equity securities securities of torchmark short terms annuity contract issued by torchmark other total at december  torchmark s qualified pension plans were under funded by million
