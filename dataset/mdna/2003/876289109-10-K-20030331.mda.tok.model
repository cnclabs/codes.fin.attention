item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading provider of private label casual apparel  serving specialty retail  mass merchandise and department store chains and major international brands located primarily in the united states by designing  merchandising  contracting for the manufacture of  manufacturing directly and selling casual  moderately priced apparel for women  men and children 
our major customers include specialty retailers  such as lerner new york  limited stores and express  all of which are divisions of the limited  as well as lane bryant  abercrombie fitch  jc penney  k mart  kohl s  mervyns  sears and wal mart 
our products are manufactured in a variety of woven and knit fabrications and include jeans wear  casual pants  t shirts  shorts  blouses  shirts and other tops  dresses and jackets 
in  our net sales remained flat  however  in  our net sales decreased by to million 
in  our net sales increased by to million 
in and  we experienced a net loss of million and million  respectively  before cumulative effect of accounting change due to our adoption of sfas no 
 and million and million  respectively  after the cumulative effect of accounting change 
from inception  we relied primarily on independent contract manufacturers located primarily in the far east 
commencing in the third quarter of  and taking advantage of the north american free trade agreement  or nafta  we substantially expanded our use of independent cutting  sewing and finishing contractors in mexico  primarily for basic garments 
commencing in  and concluding in december with the purchase of a denim and twill manufacturing plant in tlaxacala  mexico  we engaged in an ambitious program to develop a vertically integrated manufacturing operation in mexico while maintaining our sourcing operation in the far east 
we believe that the dual strategy of maintaining independent contract manufacturers in the far east and operating manufacturing facilities in mexico controlled can best serve the different needs of our customers and enable us to capitalize on advantages offered by both markets 
we believe this diversified approach also helps to mitigate the risks of doing business abroad  such as transportation delays  economic and political instability  currency fluctuations  restrictions on the transfer of funds and the imposition of tariffs  export duties  quota  and other trade restrictions 
on june   we signed a production agreement with manufactures cheja  the original term of which extended through february we extended the contract for an additional quantity of million units commencing on april   which was amended on november   for the manufacture of million units through september  on april   we formed a new company  jane doe international  llc  or jdi 
this company was formed for the purpose of purchasing the assets of needletex  inc  owner of the jane doe brand 
jdi is owned by fashion resource tcl  inc  a subsidiary of ours  and by needletex  inc 
in march  we converted jdi from an operating company to a licensing company  and entered into two licenses with regards to the use of the jane doe trademark 
pending the outcome of the litigation with patrick bensimon  owner of needletex inc  this licensing company has been largely dormant in its activities in for a description of the terms of this acquisition and details of the litigation  see item legal proceedings 
on december   we contracted to acquire a fully operational facility being constructed near puebla  mexico by an affiliate of kamel nacif  our principal shareholder 
on october   we extended our option to purchase the facility until september  in september   we exercised the option to purchase the facility and completed the transaction at the end of december  see acquisitions vertical integration 
we believe there is a major competitive advantage in being a fully integrated supplier with the capability of controlling and managing the process of manufacturing from raw materials to finished garments 
in order to execute the garment production operations  facilities have been acquired and developed to support anticipated capacity requirements 
computer systems have been developed and installed  which allow us to better track our production and inventory 
new operational policies have been implemented to insure operations function efficiently and effectively 
we have entered into a program of sharing mexico production facilities with azteca  and we believe improved utilization of our production facilities should lower unit costs and favorably impact margins 
in order to manage the shared utilization  new procedures have been adopted  which we believe will maintain control and appropriately allocate costs between azteca and us 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate estimates  including those related to returns  discounts  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a further discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
accounts receivable allowance for returns  discounts and bad debts we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable and chargebacks disputes from the customer based upon a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit sources  a specific reserve for bad debts is taken against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts and chargebacks based on our historical collection experience 
if collection experience deteriorates for example  due to an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  the estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
as of december   the balance in the allowance for returns  discounts and bad debts reserves was million  compared to million at december  this reduction can be explained by an additional reserve for bad debt related to a particular customer in inventory our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
under certain market conditions  estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory are employed by us to properly value inventory 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  the following o a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  o a significant change in the manner of the use of the acquired asset or the strategy for the overall business  or o a significant negative industry or economic trend 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
according to this statement  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer subject to amortization  but rather an annual assessment of impairment applied on a fair value based test 
we adopted sfas no 
in fiscal and performed our first annual assessment of impairment  which resulted in an impairment loss of million 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
these timing differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
management records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
management has considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
increases in the valuation allowance result in additional expense to be reflected within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
accruals are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding federal tax issues that are currently unresolved 
we routinely monitor the potential impact of these situations and believe that amounts are properly accrued for 
debt covenants our debt agreements require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and a minimum level of net worth as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
if our results of operations erode and we are not able to obtain waivers from the lenders  the debt would be in default and callable by our lenders 
in addition  due to cross default provisions in a majority of the debt agreements  approximately of our long term debt would become due in full if any of the debt is in default 
in anticipation of us not being able to meet the required covenants due to various reasons  we either negotiate for changes in the relative covenants or an advance waiver or reclassify the relevant debt as current 
we believe that results of operations will improve for the year ending december  and thereafter and the likelihood of our defaulting on debt covenants is decreasing absent any material negative event affecting the us economy as a whole 
we also believe that our lenders would provide waivers if necessary 
however  our expectations of future operating results and continued compliance with other debt covenants cannot be assured and our lenders actions are not controllable by us 
if projections of future operating results are not achieved and the debt is placed in default  we would be required to reduce our expenses  including by curtailing operations  and to raise capital through the sale of assets  issuance of equity or otherwise  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in our consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling and distribution expenses general and administration expenses amortization expense income from operations interest expense interest income minority interest other income other expense loss before provision for income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change income taxes loss before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change net loss reflects amortization of the excess of cost over fair value of assets

comparison of to net sales increased by million  or  from million in to million in  primarily due to the success of united apparel venture  llc 
the increase in net sales was attributed to million increase in sales to tommy hilfiger  one of the two customers of uav  and million to kohl s

the decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to the overall economic conditions  which are affecting the retail industry 
the weakening economy and announced layoffs have affected consumer spending habits thus hurting retail sales and causing retailers to reduce their orders from suppliers  including us

the increase in loss before taxes as a percentage of net sales was due to the decrease in net sales  selling and distribution expenses and general and administrative expense and interest expense and an increase in interest income

 net sales gross profit operating income loss net income loss as is typical for us  quarterly net sales fluctuated significantly because our customers typically place bulk orders with us  and a change in the number of orders shipped in any one period may have a material effect on the net sales for that period 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements arise from the funding of our working capital needs  principally inventory  finished goods shipments in transit  work in process and accounts receivable  including receivables from our contract manufacturers that relate primarily to fabric we purchase for use by those manufacturers 
our primary sources for working capital and capital expenditures are cash flow from operations  borrowings under our bank and other credit facilities  borrowings from principal shareholders  issuance of long term debt  borrowing from affiliates and the proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
our liquidity is dependent  in part  on customers paying on time 
any abnormal chargebacks or returns may affect our source of short term funding 
we are also subject to market price changes 
any changes in credit terms given to major customers may have an impact on our cash flow 
suppliers credit is another major source of short term financing and any adverse changes in their terms will have negative impact on our cash flow 
following is a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments available to us as of december  in millions contractual obligations payments due by period less between between after than total year years years years long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts other commercial committed less than between between after commitments available to us to us year years years years lines of credit letters of credit within lines of credit total commercial commitments net cash provided by operating activities was million in  as compared to net cash provided by operations in of million and million in net cash provided by operations in resulted primarily from a net loss of million adjusted for depreciation and amortization of million

the facility is a one year facility subject to renewal on its anniversary and is collateralized by the shares and debentures of all our subsidiaries in hong kong  as well as our permanent quota holdings in hong kong 
in addition to the guarantees provided by tarrant apparel group and fashion resource tcl  inc and machrima luxembourg sarl  a new holding company we formed during  mr 
gerard guez  our chairman  also signed a guarantee of million in favor of ups to secure this facility 
this facility is also subject to certain restrictive covenants  including no two consecutive quarterly losses  aggregate net worth of million and million at the end of and  respectively  interest coverage of times  fixed charge ratio of to and leverage ratio of to in and to in as of december   million  of which million was for letters of credits  was outstanding under this facility 
we were in violation of our fixed charge ratio covenant at december  for which a waiver was obtained for a fee of on january   we entered into a new revolving credit  factoring and security agreement the debt facility with a syndicate of lending institutions

our over advance line of million converted to a term facility to be repaid by monthly installments of  before august and  thereafter 
a total of million was outstanding under the debt facility at december  as of december   we were in violation of covenants on interest coverage  total leverage ratio  and fixed charges under the debt facility 
we received a waiver from gmac with respect to our violation of these covenants  and we received a waiver from gmac with respect to our compliance at march  with all financing covenants under the debt facility 
we paid gmac  for this waiver 
we have agreed with gmac to set new financial convenants for fiscal based on our projections before may  the debt facility includes a factoring arrangement whereby we factor with gmac accounts receivables from customers with debt ratings below bbb 
we did not receive advances against these receivables  and were paid only upon collection of proceeds

as of december   grupo famian had a short term advance from banco bilbao vizcaya amounting to  this subsidiary also had a credit facility with banco nacional de comercio exterior snc  which we guaranteed

we were in violation of the covenant on consecutive quarterly losses and obtained a waiver from the bank on march  for a fee of  and acceleration by  of monthly repayment of principal 
we have classified the ge capital obligation as a current liability because of the potential that we may be in violation of one or more of the covenants under the ge capital facilities for the first quarter of the boa facility is subject to a financial benchmark on interest coverage to and a leverage ratio of not more than times 
the debt facility with gmac and the credit facilities with ups  ge capital and boa all carry cross default clauses 
a breach of a financial covenant set by gmac  ups or ge capital constitutes an event of default  entitling these banks to demand payment in full of all outstanding amounts under their respective debt and credit facilities 
similarly  if we breach a financial benchmark set by boa  the bank can accelerate repayment of all outstanding principal amount to become six equal monthly installments

on july   we formed an entity to jointly market  share certain risks and achieve economies of scale with azteca production international  inc  called united apparel ventures  llc 
this entity was created to coordinate the production of apparel for a single customer of our branded business 
uav is owned by tag mex  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  and by azteca 
results of the operation of uav have been consolidated into our results since july with the minority partner s share of all gains and loses eliminated through the minority interest line in our financial statements 
since october  both parties have contributed the express business into uav and the results are consolidated in the company s financials 
uav makes purchases from two related parties in mexico  azteca and tag it pacific  inc in  a california limited liability company owned by messrs 
guez and kay purchased  shares of the common stock of tag it pacific  inc or approximately of such common stock then outstanding 
tag it is a provider of brand identity programs to manufacturers and retailers of apparel and accessories 
tag it assumed the responsibility for managing and sourcing all trim and packaging used in connection with products manufactured by or on our behalf in mexico 
this arrangement is terminable by either tag it or us at any time 
we believe that the terms of this arrangement  which is subject to the acceptance of our customers  are no less favorable to us than could be obtained from unaffiliated third parties 
we purchased million of trim inventory from tag it during the year ended december  from time to time we have guaranteed the indebtedness of tag it for the purchase of trim on our behalf 
we have adopted a policy that any transactions between us and any of our affiliates or related parties  including our executive officers  directors  the family members of those individuals and any of their affiliates  must i be approved by a majority of the members of the board of directors and by a majority of the disinterested members of the board of directors and ii be on terms no less favorable to us than could be obtained from unaffiliated third parties 
factors that may affect future results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  which are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth below 
risks related to our business we depend on a group of key customers for a significant portion of our sales 
a significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customer s financial position could harm our business and financial condition 
affiliated stores owned by the limited including lerner new york  limited stores and express accounted for approximately and of our net sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
lane bryant  owned by charming shoppes  accounted for and of our net sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
moreover  we believe that consolidation in the retail industry has centralized purchasing decisions and given customers greater leverage over suppliers like us  and we expect this trend to continue 
if this consolidation continues  our net sales and results of operations may be increasingly sensitive to a deterioration in the financial condition of  or other adverse developments with  one or more of our customers 
while we have long standing customer relationships  we do not have long term contracts with any of them  including the limited 
as a result  purchases generally occur on an order by order basis  and the relationship  as well as particular orders  can generally be terminated by either party at any time 
a decision by a major customer  whether motivated by competitive considerations  financial difficulties  economic conditions or otherwise  to decrease its purchases from us or to change its manner of doing business with us  could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
in addition  during recent years  various retailers  including some of our customers  have experienced significant changes and difficulties  including consolidation of ownership  increased centralization of purchasing decisions  restructurings  bankruptcies and liquidations 
these and other financial problems of some of our retailers  as well as general weakness in the retail environment  increase the risk of extending credit to these retailers 
a significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customer s financial position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer  require us to assume more credit risk relating to that customer s receivables  limit our ability to collect amounts related to previous purchases by that customer  or result in required prepayment of our receivables securitization arrangements  all of which could harm our business and financial condition 
we have only limited experience operating a vertically integrated business 
during  we completed the vertical integration of our business  which included establishing cutting  sewing  washing  finishing  packing  shipping and distribution activities in company owned facilities or through the acquisition of established contractors and establishing fabric production capability through the acquisition of established textile mills or the construction of new mills 
prior to  we had no previous history of operating textile mills or cutting  sewing  washing  finishing  packing or shipping operations upon which an evaluation of the prospects of our vertical integration strategy can be based 
since the beginning of our vertical integration strategy  we have experienced increased complexities 
in addition  the implementation of the integration strategy could place significant strain on our administrative  operational and financial resources and increased demands on our financial systems and controls 
our ability to manage our vertical integration successfully will require us to continue to improve and expand these resources  systems and controls 
if our management is unable to manage our vertical integration effectively  our operating results could be adversely affected 
failure to manage our growth and expansion could impair our business 
since our inception  we have experienced periods of rapid growth 
no assurance can be given that we will be successful in maintaining or increasing our sales in the future 
any future growth in sales will require additional working capital and may place a significant strain on our management  management information systems  inventory management  production capability  distribution facilities and receivables management 
any disruption in our order processing  sourcing or distribution systems could cause orders to be shipped late  and under industry practices  retailers generally can cancel orders or refuse to accept goods due to late shipment 
such cancellations and returns would result in a reduction in revenue  increased administrative and shipping costs and a further burden on our distribution facilities 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  substantial variations in our net sales and operating results from quarter to quarter 
we believe that the factors which influence this variability of quarterly results include the timing of our introduction of new product lines  the level of consumer acceptance of each new product line  general economic and industry conditions that affect consumer spending and retailer purchasing  the availability of manufacturing capacity  the seasonality of the markets in which we participate  the timing of trade shows  the product mix of customer orders  the timing of the placement or cancellation of customer orders  the weather  transportation delays  quotas  the occurrence of chargebacks in excess of reserves and the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales and actions of competitors 
due to fluctuations in our revenue and operating expenses  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is possible that in some future quarter or quarters  our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in that case  our stock price could fluctuate significantly or decline 
increases in the price of raw materials or their reduced availability could increase our cost of sales and decrease our profitability 
the principal raw material used our apparel is cotton 
the price and availability of cotton may fluctuate significantly  depending on a variety of factors  including crop yields  weather  supply conditions  government regulation  economic climate and other unpredictable factors 
any raw material price increases could increase our cost of sales and decrease our profitability unless we are able to pass higher prices on to our customers 
moreover  any decrease in the availability of cotton could impair our ability to meet our production requirements in a timely manner 
the success of our business depends upon our ability to offer innovative and upgraded products 
the apparel industry is characterized by constant product innovation due to changing consumer preferences and by the rapid replication of new products by competitors 
as a result  our success depends in large part on our ability to continuously develop  market and deliver innovative products at a pace and intensity competitive with other manufacturers in our segments 
in addition  we must create products that appeal to multiple consumer segments at a range of price points 
any failure on our part to regularly develop innovative products and update core products could o limit our ability to differentiate  segment and price our products  o adversely affect retail and consumer acceptance of our products  and o limit sales growth 
the increasing importance of product innovation in apparel requires us to strengthen our internal research and commercialization capabilities  to rely on successful commercial relationships with third parties such as fiber  fabric and finishing providers and to compete and negotiate effectively for new technologies and product components 
the financial condition of our customers could affect our results of operations 
certain retailers  including some of our customers  have experienced in the past  and may experience in the future  financial difficulties  which increase the risk of extending credit to such retailers and the risk that financial failure will eliminate a customer entirely 
these retailers have attempted to improve their own operating efficiencies by concentrating their purchasing power among a narrowing group of vendors 
there can be no assurance that we will remain a preferred vendor for our existing customers 
a decrease in business from or loss of a major customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
there can be no assurance that our factor will approve the extension of credit to certain retail customers in the future 
if a customer s credit is not approved by the factor  we could assume the collection risk on sales to the customer itself  require that the customer provide a letter of credit  or choose not to make sales to the customer 
the success of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees 
we need talented and experienced personnel in a number of areas including our core business activities 
our success is dependent upon strengthening our management depth across our business at a rapid pace 
an inability to retain and attract qualified personnel or the loss of any of our current key executives could harm our business 
our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is adversely affected by the los angeles location of our corporate headquarters due to the high cost of living in the los angeles area 
we depend on our computer and communications systems 
as a multi national corporation  we rely on our computer and communication network to operate efficiently 
any interruption of this service from power loss  telecommunications failure  weather  natural disasters or any similar event could have a material adverse affect on our business and operations 
recently  hackers and computer viruses have disrupted the operations of several major companies 
we may be vulnerable to similar acts of sabotage  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
we may require additional capital in the future 
we may not be able to fund our future growth or react to competitive pressures if we lack sufficient funds 
currently  we believe we have sufficient cash available through our bank credit facilities  issuance of long term debt  proceeds from loans from affiliates  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options to fund existing operations for the foreseeable future 
however  in the future we may need to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or collaborative relationships 
this additional funding may not be available or  if available  it may not be available on economically reasonable terms 
in addition  any additional funding may result in significant dilution to existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our operations or obtain funds through collaborative partners that may require us to release material rights to our products 
our business is subject to risks associated with importing products 
we import raw materials and finished garments 
substantially all of our import operations are subject to tariffs imposed on imported products and quotas imposed by trade agreements 
in addition  the countries in which our products are manufactured or imported may from time to time impose additional new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions on our imports or adversely modify existing restrictions 
adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions  or our suppliers failure to comply with customs or similar laws  could harm our business 
we cannot assure that future trade agreements will not provide our competitors with an advantage over us  or increase our costs  either of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
our operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement  and the activities and regulations of the world trade organization 
generally  these trade agreements benefit our business by reducing or eliminating the duties and or quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country 
however  trade agreements can also impose requirements that adversely affect our business  such as limiting the countries from which we can purchase raw materials and setting quotas on products that may be imported into the united states from a particular country 
in addition  the world trade organization may commence a new round of trade negotiations that liberalize textile trade by further eliminating quotas or reducing tariffs 
the elimination of quotas on world trade organization member countries by and other effects of these trade agreements could result in increased competition from developing countries  which historically have lower labor costs  including china and taiwan  both of which recently became members of the world trade organization 
due to our vertical integration in mexico  this increased competition could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
our ability to import products in a timely and cost effective manner may also be affected by problems at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers  such as labor disputes 
these problems could require us to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to our customers 
these alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs  which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition 
our partial dependence on independent manufacturers reduces our ability to control the manufacturing process  which could harm our sales  reputation and overall profitability 
although we have reduced our reliance on outside third party contractors through our vertical integration in mexico  a substantial portion of our sourcing are manufactured by independent cutting  sewing and finishing contractors 
as a result  we depend on independent contract manufacturers to secure a sufficient supply of raw materials and maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity in an environment characterized by declining prices  continuing cost pressure and increased demands for product innovation and speed to market 
this dependence could subject us to difficulty in obtaining timely delivery of products of acceptable quality 
in addition  a contractor s failure to ship products to us in a timely manner or to meet the required quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers 
the failure to make timely deliveries may cause our customers to cancel orders  refuse to accept deliveries  impose non compliance charges through invoice deductions or other charge backs  demand reduced prices or reduce future orders  any of which could harm our sales  reputation and overall profitability 
we do not have material long term contracts with any of our independent contractors and any of these contractors may unilaterally terminate their relationship with us at any time 
to the extent we are not able to secure or maintain relationships with independent contractors that are able to fulfill our requirements  our business would be harmed 
although we monitor the compliance of our independent contractors with applicable labor laws  we do not control our contractors or their labor practices 
the violation of federal  state or foreign labor laws by one of the our contractors could result in our being subject to fines and our goods that are manufactured in violation of such laws being seized or their sale in interstate commerce being prohibited 
from time to time  we have been notified by federal  state or foreign authorities that certain of our contractors are the subject of investigations or have been found to have violated applicable labor laws 
to date  we have not been subject to any sanctions that  individually or in the aggregate  have had a material adverse effect on our business  and we are not aware of any facts on which any such sanctions could be based 
there can be no assurance  however  that in the future we will not be subject to sanctions as a result of violations of applicable labor laws by our contractors  or that such sanctions will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
in addition  certain of our customers  including the limited  require strict compliance by their apparel manufacturers  including us  with applicable labor laws and visit our facilities often 
there can be no assurance that the violation of applicable labor laws by one of our contractors will not have a material adverse effect on our relationship with our customers 
our business is subject to risks of operating in a foreign country and trade restrictions 
approximately of our products were imported from outside the us in fiscal  and most of our fixed assets are located in mexico 
the company is subject to the risks associated with doing business and owning fixed assets in foreign countries  including  but not limited to  transportation delays and interruptions  political instability  expropriation  currency fluctuations and the imposition of tariffs  import and export controls  other non tariff barriers including changes in the allocation of quotas and cultural issues 
any changes in those countries labor laws and government regulations may have a negative effect on our profitability 
our operations in mexico are subject to risks associated with manufacturing facilities 
increased competition from other foreign countries could adversely affect the results of our operations 
as a manufacturer in mexico  we are subject to the risks associated with owning a manufacturing business  including but not limited to  the maintenance and management of manufacturing facilities  equipment  employees  trade unions and inventories 
the risk of being a fully integrated manufacturer is increased in an industrial wide slowdown because of the fixed costs associated with manufacturing facilities 
as of  quota on chinese origin apparel will be phased out 
this may pose serious challenges to mexican apparel products sold to the united states market 
products from china now receive the same preferential tariff treatment accorded goods from countries granted ntr status 
with china becoming a member of the wto  this status is now permanent 
our products manufactured in mexico may be adversely affected by the increased competition from chinese products 
our cost reduction measures may adversely affect our business and operations 
since the beginning of  we have been making efforts to reduce overhead costs by the elimination of functions duplicated in los angeles  new york and mexico 
in addition  in we continued reducing headcount by in the us and approximately in both mexico and hong kong due to decreased sales 
as a result  some personnel may be required to perform additional functions or responsibilities  which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we cannot guarantee that our future acquisitions will be successful 
in the future  we may seek to continue our growth through acquisition 
we compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with companies which have significantly greater financial and management resources than us 
there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition or investment opportunities will be identified  that any of these transactions can be consummated  or that  if acquired  these new businesses can be integrated successfully and profitably into our operations 
these acquisitions and investments may also require a significant allocation of resources  which will reduce our ability to focus on the other portions of our business  including many of the factors listed in the prior risk factor 
risk associated with our industry our sales are heavily influenced by general economic cycles 
apparel is a cyclical industry that is heavily dependent upon the overall level of consumer spending 
purchases of apparel and related goods tend to be highly correlated with cycles in the disposable income of our consumers 
our customers anticipate and respond to adverse changes in economic conditions and uncertainty by reducing inventories and canceling orders 
as a result  any substantial deterioration in general economic conditions  increases in interest rates  acts of war  terrorist or political events that diminish consumer spending and confidence in any of the regions in which we compete  could reduce our sales and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
this has been underscored by the events of september  and the war in the middle east 
our business is highly competitive and depends on consumer spending patterns 
the apparel industry is highly competitive 
we face a variety of competitive challenges including o anticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer demands  o developing innovative  high quality products in sizes  colors and styles that appeal to consumers of varying age groups and tastes  o competitively pricing our products and achieving customer perception of value  and o providing strong and effective marketing support 
we must successfully gauge fashion trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed 
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to gauge the fashion tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies retail and customer demand in a timely manner 
the apparel business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences dictated in part by fashion and season 
to the extent we misjudge the market for our merchandise  our sales may be adversely affected 
our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to changing fashion trends depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel in our design  merchandising and marketing staff 
competition for these personnel is intense  and we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods 
our business is subject to seasonal trends 
historically  our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis 
this trend is dependent on numerous factors  including the markets in which we operate  holiday seasons  consumer demand  climate  economic conditions and numerous other factors beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that our historic operating patterns will continue in future periods as we cannot influence or forecast many of these factors 
risks related to our common stock 
our management owns a significant percentage of our common stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over our affairs 
our executive officers and directors will continue to beneficially own of our outstanding common stock  based upon the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of march  accordingly  these stockholders effectively have the ability to control the outcome on all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election and removal of directors and any change in control 
this concentration of ownership of our common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us or otherwise discouraging or preventing a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us 
this  in turn  could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock 
it could also prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market prices for their shares of common stock 
our stock price has been volatile 
our common stock is quoted on the nasdaq national market system  and there can be substantial volatility in the market price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including quarterly variations in operating results  operating results which vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors  changes in financial estimates  changes in market valuations of competitors  announcements by us or our competitors of a material nature  loss of one or more customers  additions or departures of key personnel  future sales of common stock and stock market price and volume fluctuations 
in addition  general political and economic conditions such as a recession  or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of our common stock 
often  price fluctuations are unrelated to operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is affected 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s stock  securities class action litigation has occurred against the issuing company 
if we were subject to this type of litigation in the future  we could incur substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings 
any adverse determination in this type of litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities 
absence of dividends could reduce our attractiveness to you 
some investors favor companies that pay dividends  particularly in general downturns in the stock market 
we have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth  and we do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
because we may not pay dividends  your return on this investment likely depends on your selling our stock at a profit 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies as a result of doing business in mexico as well as certain debt denominated in the euro 
as a result  we bear the risk of exchange rate gains and losses that may result in the future as a result of this financing 
at times we use forward exchange contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuations of foreign currencies on purchases and commitments 
these short term assets and commitments are principally related to trade payables positions and fixed asset purchase obligations 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
we actively evaluate the creditworthiness of the financial institutions that are counter parties to derivative financial instruments  and we do not expect any counter parties to fail to meet their obligations 
interest rate risk 
because our obligations under our various credit agreements bear interest at floating rates primarily libor rates  we are sensitive to changes in prevailing interest rates 
any major increase or decrease in market interest rates that affect our financial instruments would have a material impact on earning or cash flows during the next fiscal year 
our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect interest paid on our debt 
a majority of our credit facilities are at variable rates
