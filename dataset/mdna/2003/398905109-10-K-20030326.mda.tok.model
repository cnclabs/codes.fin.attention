item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading operator in the trillion automotive retailing industry 
through a series of acquisitions  we operate dealership franchises in california  colorado  florida  georgia  louisiana  massachusetts  new mexico  oklahoma and texas 
through our dealerships and internet sites  we sell new and used cars and light trucks  arrange related financing  vehicle service and insurance contracts  provide maintenance and repair services  and sell replacement parts 
we also operate collision service centers 
we have diverse sources of revenues  including new car sales  new truck sales  used car sales  used truck sales  manufacturer remarketed vehicle sales  parts sales  service sales  collision repair services  financing fees  vehicle service contract fees  insurance fees and after market product sales 
sales revenues from new and used vehicle sales and parts and service sales include sales to retail customers  other dealerships and wholesalers 
finance and insurance revenues include fees from arranging financing  vehicle service and insurance contracts  net of a provision for anticipated chargebacks 
our total gross margin varies as our merchandise mix the mix between new vehicle sales  used vehicle sales retail and wholesale  parts and service sales  collision repair service sales and finance and insurance revenues changes 
our gross margin on the sale of products and services varies significantly  with new vehicle sales generally resulting in the lowest gross margin and finance and insurance revenues generally resulting in the highest gross margin 
when our new vehicle sales increase or decrease at a rate greater than our other revenue sources  our gross margin responds inversely 
factors such as seasonality  weather  cyclicality and manufacturers advertising and incentives may impact our merchandise mix  and therefore influence our gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of incentive based compensation for sales  administrative  finance and general management personnel  rent  marketing  insurance and utilities 
we believe that approximately of our selling  general and administrative expenses are variable  allowing us to adjust our cost structure based on business trends 
it takes about three months to adjust our cost structure when business volume changes significantly 
interest expense consists of interest charges on interest bearing debt  including floorplan inventory financing  net of interest income earned 
we receive interest assistance from various of our manufacturers 
this assistance  which is reflected as a reduction of cost of sales  has ranged between and of floorplan interest expense over the past three years  mitigating the impact of interest rate changes on our financial results

year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to  million for the year ended december   from  million for the year ended december  the growth in total revenues came from acquisitions  which were partially offset by a same store revenues decline of million 
new vehicle revenues increased million  as acquired operations offset a same store decline of million 
the same store revenues decreased slightly  which reflected a less robust vehicle market in  as compared to the near record new vehicle sales in  for all automobile retailers in the united states 
our used vehicle retail revenues declined million as revenues from acquired operations were offset by an million decline in our same store sales 
the same store sales decline was due to high levels of manufacturer incentives on new vehicle sales  which reduced the price difference to the customer between a late model used vehicle and a new vehicle  thus switching more customers to new vehicles 
wholesale sales increased million 
the decline in retail sales required us to wholesale more vehicles to keep inventory turns on target and inventory levels in line with expected retail sales volumes 
the increase in parts and service revenues of million was from acquired operations as our same store sales declined million 
the primary driver of the same store sales decline was the ford firestone tire recall  which caused a one time increase in warranty and associated repairs at our ford dealerships during also contributing to the decrease was increased business during the summer months of  due to the damage caused by tropical storm allison  in houston 
these declines offset the same store increases we had in other areas of our operations 
retail finance fee revenues increased million  with a million same store decrease partially offsetting the revenues contributed by acquisitions 
the same store decline was caused primarily by zero percent financing offered by many of the manufacturers for our customers  which began late in and continued throughout  which reduced the amount of fees we earned for arranging the financing 
vehicle service contract fee revenues increased million  with same store sales increasing million 
included in the revenues from acquired dealerships is million of deferred revenues recognized on dealer obligor contracts written prior to our acquisitions of the dealerships 
at the date of acquisition  we moved the dealerships to administrator obligor contracts 
other finance and insurance revenues increased million  with same store sales contributing million 
the same store increases are being driven by the introduction and sale of new products  in addition to our training programs 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to an increase in the gross margin from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december   and increased revenues 
the gross margin increased  as lower margin new and used vehicle revenues decreased as a percentage of total revenues  and increased finance and insurance revenues  per retail unit sold  offset the decline in the new and used vehicle gross margins 
the gross margin on new retail vehicle sales declined to from  partially due to a reduction in floorplan assistance received from our manufacturers as a result of the decline in interest rates during the year  which reduced our gross profit by million and our gross margin by basis points 
floorplan assistance is a purchase discount and is recorded as a reduction of new vehicle cost of sales 
performance below expectations and prior year levels in our dallas operations accounts for approximately basis points of the decline in our new vehicle margin 
also  generally  the gross profit per retail unit does not vary with changes in the selling prices of the vehicles 
as such  the increase in our average selling price per new vehicle sold negatively impacted our new vehicle gross margin by basis points 
the gross margin on retail used vehicle sales increased to from as our dealerships worked to increase the gross profit per unit sold to offset the impact of the reduction of retail used vehicle sales 
our wholesale losses increased  as we wholesaled more vehicles  in light of the decline in the retail sales volume 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the additional operations acquired and increased compensation and benefits 
compensation and benefits are largely incentive based and constitute approximately of total expenses  and increased due to increased gross profit 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of gross profit to from due primarily to below expected operating performance in our atlanta and dallas operations 
excluding the gross profit and selling  general and administrative expenses of our atlanta and dallas operations  our selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross profit would have been in interest expense 
floorplan and other interest expense  net  decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to a decline in interest rates and a lower average balance of debt outstanding 
during the year ended december   there was an approximately basis point reduction in our floorplan financing rate as compared to the prior year 
during october  we completed a million stock offering and used the proceeds initially to pay down borrowings under our credit facility 
by the end of the third quarter of  we had reborrowed the amounts used to pay down the floorplan portion of our credit facility 
we have had no borrowings under the acquisition portion of our credit facility during other income expense  net 
other expense increased  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase is due primarily to million of losses recorded on the repurchases and retirements of a portion of our senior subordinated notes

new vehicle revenues increased million  primarily from same store revenues  which increased million 
as compared to a decline in total new vehicle unit sales for automobile retailers in the united states  our same store revenues increase of was driven by strong customer acceptance of our products  particularly toyota  lexus and honda and aggressive manufacturer incentives 
the remaining increase of million came from the acquisitions of additional dealership operations during and  net of decreases due to the sale of a few small dealerships 
the growth in used vehicle retail revenues of million was primarily attributable to growth in our same store sales of million 
the same store sales growth was due to an emphasis on used vehicle sales in the new mexico  atlanta  oklahoma  boston  houston  west texas and austin markets 
the additional dealership operations acquired contributed the remaining million of the increase 
wholesale sales declined million due to the emphasis on increasing retail sales in the above markets 
the increase in parts and service revenues of million was due to strong same store sales growth of million 
the same store sales growth came primarily from our boston  houston  oklahoma and south florida operations 
the primary driver of the same store sales growth was the ford firestone tire recall  which caused an increase in warranty and associated repairs at our ford dealerships 
also contributing to the increase was a higher volume of business due to the damage caused by tropical storm allison in houston  during the summer months of the additional dealership operations acquired  net of sold dealerships  contributed the remaining million of the increase 
retail finance fee revenues increased million  with million of the increase coming from same store sales and million being contributed by acquisitions 
offsetting the increase was a decline in revenues from one time incentives on retail finance programs 
vehicle service contract fee revenues increased million  with same store sales of million and acquired operations contributing million 
offsetting the increases were deferrals of revenues related to sales of dealer obligor contracts 
other finance and insurance revenues increased million  with same store sales contributing million and acquired operations contributing million 
offsetting these increases was a decline caused by reduced one time incentives due to a decline in the volume of credit life and accident and disability contracts sold 
the same store revenues increase in retail finance fees  vehicle service contract fees and other finance and insurance revenues is primarily attributable to increased sales training  company wide benchmarking  a favorable interest rate market and an increase in the number of retail new and used units sold 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to an increase in the gross margin from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december   and increased revenues 
the gross margin increased as lower margin new vehicle revenues decreased as a percentage of total revenues  and increased gross margins on total used vehicle sales and parts and service sales offset the majority of the decline in the new vehicle gross margin 
the gross margin on new retail vehicle sales declined to from due primarily to the decline in interest rates during the year  which resulted in a reduction in the amount of floorplan assistance paid by various of our manufacturers 
floorplan assistance is a purchase discount and is recorded as a reduction of new vehicle cost of sales 
the gross margin on retail used vehicle sales decreased to from due primarily to pressure on used vehicle values caused by aggressive incentives placed on new vehicles by the manufacturers 
the pressure on used vehicle pricing also increased our losses on used vehicle wholesale sales as the market value of used vehicles declined more rapidly than in the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increased compensation and benefits  which are largely incentive based and constitute approximately of total expenses  and increased selling expenses 
compensation and benefits  and selling expenses increased due to increased revenues and gross profit 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of gross profit to from due primarily to the additional dealership operations acquired not achieving the same expense leverage as the existing dealerships 
interest expense 
floorplan and other interest expense  net  decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to a decline in interest rates 
during the year ended december   there was an approximately basis point reduction in our floorplan financing rate as compared to the prior year 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  decreased  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the decrease is due primarily to a million gain from the sale of a chrysler franchise in austin  texas  during liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations  our credit facility which includes the floorplan facility and the acquisition facility and equity and debt offerings 
the following table sets forth selected historical information from our statements of cash flows year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used in investing activities    net cash provided by used in financing activities   net increase in cash and cash equivalents    cash flows total cash at december   was million 
operating activities 
for the three year period ended december   we generated million in net cash from operating activities  primarily driven by net income plus depreciation and amortization 
investing activities 
during  the million of cash used for investing activities was primarily attributable to the use of million of cash in acquisitions  net of cash balances obtained in the acquisitions  and purchases of property and equipment 
we used approximately million for purchases of property and equipment  with approximately million being for the purchase of land and construction of new facilities 
offsetting these uses was million received from the sales of three dealership franchises during during  million of cash was used for investing activities primarily attributable to purchases of property and equipment and cash paid in acquisitions  net of cash balances obtained in the acquisitions  partially offset by proceeds from sales of franchises 
during  we used approximately million in purchasing property and equipment  of which  approximately million was for the purchase of land and construction of new facilities

during  we used approximately million in purchasing property and equipment  of which  approximately million was for the purchase of land and construction of new facilities 
financing activities 
we obtained approximately million from financing activities during  primarily borrowings under our credit facility 
we reborrowed amounts available under our credit facility that were paid down with the proceeds from our stock offering in october additionally  we spent million repurchasing a portion of our senior subordinated notes and million for repurchases of common stock 
during  we used approximately million in financing activities 
the uses were primarily attributable to paydowns made on our revolving credit facility and repurchases of common stock  largely offset by the proceeds of our common stock offering 
in october  we completed an offering of million shares of our common stock  with net proceeds from the offering  after expenses  of approximately million 
the proceeds from the offering  as well as cash flows from operations  were used to reduce the outstanding balance under our credit facility by million 
we may reborrow the amounts repaid under our credit facility for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
during we used approximately  in financing activities 
cash was provided primarily through borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
we used million for principal payments of long term debt 
additionally  we used million for repurchases of common stock 
working capital 
at december   we had working capital of million  which is approximately million higher than we believe we need to operate our existing business 
we expect to use this excess working capital to fund acquisitions and anticipated capital expenditures 
historically  we have funded our operations with internally generated cash flow and borrowings 
while we cannot guarantee it  based on current facts and circumstances  we believe we have adequate cash flow coupled with borrowing capacity under our credit facility to fund our current operations and capital expenditures and acquisitions budgeted for if our capital expenditure or acquisition plans for as outlined below change  we may need to access the private or public capital markets to obtain additional funding 
stock repurchase in november  the board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million of our stock  subject to management s judgment and the restrictions of our various debt agreements 
our agreements  subject to other covenants  allow us to use up to approximately of our cumulative net income to repurchase stock and pay dividends 
during we repurchased approximately thousand shares for approximately million 
as of december   we had the capacity to repurchase an additional million of stock under the november board of directors authorization 
we allocate our financial resources based on a risk adjusted analysis of expected returns 
as such  we may repurchase shares of our common stock if market conditions allow us to receive an acceptable return on investment 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures include expenditures to extend the useful life of current facilities and expenditures to start or expand operations 
historically  our annual capital expenditures exclusive of new or expanded operations have approximately equaled our annual depreciation charge 
expenditures relating to the construction or expansion of dealership facilities  generally  are driven by new franchises being granted to us by a manufacturer or significant growth in sales at an existing facility 
during  we plan to invest approximately million to expand thirteen existing facilities and prepare three new facilities for operations 
additionally  many of our dealership facilities are leased to us 
with respect to leased facilities during  we expect there will be three new dealership facilities built for new dealership franchises granted to us  one new dealership facility to which we will relocate an existing dealership and three existing dealership facilities will be expanded 
the result of these projects for new and expanded operations is an estimated incremental annual rent expense of million  per year 
acquisition financing our acquisition target for is to complete platform and tuck in acquisitions that have approximately million in annual revenues 
we expect the cash needed to complete our acquisitions will come from excess working capital  operating cash flows of our dealerships and borrowings under our credit facility 
depending on the market value of our common stock  we may issue common stock to fund a portion of the purchase price of acquisitions 
credit facility our credit facility provides a floorplan facility of million  with an interest rate of libor plus basis points  for financing vehicle inventories 
additionally  the credit facility provides an acquisition facility of million for financing acquisitions  general corporate purposes and capital expenditures and bears interest at libor plus a margin varying between to basis points  determined based on a ratio of debt to equity 
the amount available to be borrowed under the acquisition portion of the credit facility is dependent upon a calculation based on our cash flow 
based on our december   financial statements  million was available  after deducting million for outstanding letters of credit 
the credit facility also contains various covenants including financial ratios  such as fixed charge coverage  interest coverage and a minimum net worth requirement  among others  as well as other requirements that must be maintained

the credit facility allows up to of net income to be used for cash dividends and stock repurchases 
our credit facility matures on december  the credit facility funds our inventory and  at times  acquisitions and other general corporate needs 
we are currently in discussions for a new long term credit facility with our current lender group 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to close a new long term credit facility with the same terms and conditions as our current credit facility 
at february   million was outstanding under the credit facility for inventory financing and million was outstanding under the acquisition portion of the credit facility for borrowings and letters of credit 
during july  we entered into a two year interest rate swap with a notional amount of million 
additionally  during october  we entered into a three year interest rate swap with a notional amount of million 
the effect of these swaps is to convert the interest rate on a portion of our floorplan borrowings from the day libor based rate to an average fixed rate of interest of 
leases we lease various real estate  facilities and equipment under long term operating lease agreements 
generally  the leases have year total terms with initial terms of years and three five year option periods  at our option 
additionally  we generally have an option to purchase the real estate and facilities at the end of the lease term  and a right of first refusal  giving us the opportunity to purchase the real estate and facilities if the owner reaches an agreement to sell them to a third party 
obligations and commitments the following is a summary of our future contractual cash obligations contractual cash obligations thereafter total in thousands debt   floorplan notes payable   leases        other long term obligations total        excludes interest payments 
our credit facility is currently set to mature on december  the credit facility provides commitments for inventory financing  floorplan notes payable  up to million  of which we had borrowed million at december  payments  generally  are required to be made on the floorplan notes payable as the vehicles are sold 
the credit facility also provides commitments for a revolving credit line for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions  up to million  of which million was outstanding under letters of credit at december  other than the interest rate swap agreements discussed above  there are no other significant contractual commitments to or from us 
current business trends during  approximately million new vehicles were sold in the united states 
industry analyst estimates for are predicting new vehicle unit sales of approximately million units 
as the used vehicle market has been negatively impacted by aggressive manufacturer incentives on new vehicles  we expect the used vehicle market to be down to in due to the increase in units in operation from the recent record new vehicle sales  and the increasing complexity of the vehicles being sold today  we expect to see growth in the parts and service market for franchised automobile dealers 
we expect the interest rate environment in to be similar to what we experienced in for a discussion of other uncertainties that may impact our business  please review the business risk factors section of this form k 
discussion of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the significant estimates made by us in the accompanying consolidated financial statements relate to reserves for inventory valuations and future chargebacks on finance and vehicle service contract fees  and valuation of intangible assets 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
below is a discussion of what we believe are our critical accounting policies 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding our accounting policies 
inventories new  used and demonstrator vehicles are stated at the lower of cost or market 
vehicle inventory cost consists of the amount paid to acquire the inventory  plus reconditioning cost  cost of equipment added and transportation cost 
additionally  we receive interest assistance from some of our manufacturers 
the assistance is accounted for as a vehicle purchase price discount and is reflected as a reduction to the inventory cost on the balance sheet and as a reduction to cost of sales in the income statement as the vehicles are sold 
parts and accessories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or market 
as the market value of our inventories typically declines with the passage of time  valuation reserves are provided against the inventory balances based on the agings of the inventories and market trends 
additionally  used vehicles present added complexity to the inventory valuation process 
there is no standardized source for determining exact values  as each vehicle and each market we operate in  is unique 
as such  these factors are also considered in determining the appropriate level of valuation reserves 
retail finance and vehicle service contract revenues recognition we arrange financing for customers through various institutions and receive financing fees based on the difference between the loan rates charged to customers over predetermined financing rates set by the financing institution 
in addition  we receive fees from the sale of vehicle service contracts to customers 
we may be charged back chargebacks for unearned financing fees or vehicle service contract fees in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers 
the revenues from financing fees and vehicle service contract fees in administrator obligor states are recorded at the time of the sale of the vehicles and a reserve for future chargebacks is established based on historical operating results and the termination provisions of the applicable contracts 
in dealer obligor states  revenues from vehicle service contract fees and related direct costs are deferred and recognized over the life of the contracts 
intangible assets the following are recently issued statements by the financial accounting standards board that we believe could have a significant impact on our reported financial condition or statement of operations 
in june  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations was issued 
sfas no 
eliminates the use of the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations and establishes the purchase method as the only acceptable method 
we adopted this statement effective july  acquired intangible assets  if any  are separately recognized if  among other things  the benefit is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  such as franchise agreements 
goodwill is recorded only to the extent the purchase price for an entity exceeds the fair value of the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
in june  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets was issued 
sfas no 
changes the treatment of goodwill by no longer amortizing goodwill  however  other identifiable intangible assets are to be separately recognized and amortized  as applicable 
the statement requires  at least annually  an assessment for impairment of goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets by applying a fair value based test 
we complete the required assessment at the end of each calendar year  and at such other times as required by events or circumstances at a reporting unit indicating a potential reduction of fair value below book value 
in performing the assessment  we estimate the fair value of our intangibles using a calculation based on the historical and expected cash flows of the dealerships  market trends and conditions  review of completed transactions and current market valuations 
a portion of our intangible assets relates to franchise value  which is considered to have an indefinite life  with goodwill accounting for the remainder 
we adopted this statement effective january  adoption did not result in an impairment of any intangible assets  based on the new fair value based test  however  changes in facts and circumstances surrounding this estimate could result in an impairment of intangible assets in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the table below provides information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement 
our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
our policy is to manage interest rate exposure through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
additionally  interest rate swaps may be used to adjust our exposure to interest rate movements 
these swaps are entered into with financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
all interest rate swaps are non trading and qualify for hedge accounting 
fair value december  expected maturity date dollars in millions thereafter total variable rate debt current average interest rates non current average interest rates total variable rate debt interest rate swaps average pay rate fixed 
average receive rate variable net variable rate debt the day libor used is as of december  the rate shown includes the basis point spread charged on the floorplan notes payable 
both swaps variable rates are based on day libor 
at december   our variable rate floorplan notes payable have increased over the prior year due to increases in inventory levels and greater leverage on the inventory 
a basis point increase in interest rates would have increased floorplan interest expense million for the year ended december   before the impact of our interest rate swaps 
we have had no other significant balances outstanding under variable rate borrowing agreements 
at times  we have used interest rate swaps to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
currently  we have two interest rate swaps outstanding  each with notional amounts of million and converting day libor to a fixed rate 
as these swaps are hedging our floorplan interest rate exposure  the impact on interest expense is included in floorplan interest expense in our statements of operations 
a basis point increase in interest rates would reduce the cost of the swaps and  thus  reduce our floorplan interest expense by million for the year ended december  one of the swaps  with a notional amount of million  expires at the end of july as such  depending on interest rate levels during the last five months of  our floorplan interest expense could be impacted 
the net result on floorplan interest expense of a basis point increase in interest rates is an increase of million  after combining the increase in expense on our borrowings and the decrease in expense from our swaps 
additionally  we receive floorplan interest assistance from the majority of our manufacturers 
this assistance  which has ranged from approximately to of our floorplan interest expense over the past three years  totaled million during we treat this interest assistance as a vehicle purchase price discount  and reflect it as a reduction of new vehicle cost of sales as new vehicles are sold 
approximately half of the assistance we receive varies with changes in interest rates
