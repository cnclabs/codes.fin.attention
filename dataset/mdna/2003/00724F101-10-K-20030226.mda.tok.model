item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
beginning in fiscal  we categorize our products into the four principal business segments as explained below 
creative professional creative professional market opportunity since adobe was founded in the early s  a core customer of the company has been the creative professional 
graphic designers  production artists  web designers  technical writers  videographers  photographers  and prepress professionals use and rely on adobe s solutions for professional publishing  web design  business document publishing  and printing visually rich information 
our software tools are used by creative professionals to create much of the printed and on line information people see and read every day  including newspapers  magazines  web sites  catalogs  advertisements  brochures  product documentation  technical manuals  books  ebooks  memos  reports  and banners 
since the global economic downturn began early in  creative professionals have been under economic duress 
they derive their revenue mainly from marketing and ad spending in corporations 
with a global reduction in marketing spending  the businesses of creative professionals have suffered 
consequently  there has been a decline in spending by creative professionals on software  a decline in growth of the number of creative professionals  and for adobe  a decline in revenue from the creative professional customer segment 
however  the creative professional market continues to evolve  with increased needs to derive greater efficiency from the software they use  the need to streamline their publishing workflows  and the desire to repurpose content across a variety of media 
adobe s brand and customer loyalty in this market continues to be strong 
existing customers purchase upgrades and new units of our creative professional products because of the frequent use of the products in their daily work 
however  until an economic recovery occurs in the major countries in which we do business  we believe that our creative professional business will continue to be challenging 
as part of our corporate strategy  we are increasing our focus on the creative professional customer 
thus  we have established a new creative professional business unit that will focus solely on the needs of this customer 
in fiscal  the creative professional business unit will focus on two key strategies increasing the number of adobe products they use and enabling more efficient collaboration and workflow through improved product integration and by offering a professional version of acrobat to assist in digitizing their publishing workflow 
to accomplish these two strategies  adobe plans to execute against a number of key imperatives 
they include continue to provide best of class products  grow usage of adobe products such as professional page layout and illustration  introduce a new version of adobe acrobat which will have specific features creative professionals can use to increase their productivity  and focus on the licensing of collections of adobe software applications that provide a more complete integrated solution for various types of creative professionals

epaper epaper market opportunity a significant opportunity exists to enable intelligent integration of paper and digital document communications with fidelity and reliability in businesses and governments around the world 
adobe acrobat software  the cornerstone of our epaper family of products  at its most basic level enables users to create pdf files the worldwide standard for secure and reliable electronic document distribution 
with more than million distributed copies of our acrobat reader the free multi platform adobe pdf viewing software adobe has created a ubiquitous platform for the reliable distribution of electronic documents 
the acrobat reader is available on the most common operating system platforms  including microsoft windows  apple macintosh  linux  various unix based platforms  and portable device systems such as palm os  pocket pc  and the symbian operating system for cellular phones 
together  acrobat  adobe pdf  and the acrobat reader assure creators of electronic documents that their content will display and print the way they are intended  and that the documents are protected  if they choose  from unauthorized access and alterations 
with additional capabilities in acrobat that allow users to annotate  collaborate  secure  digitally sign  and archive pdf documents  we believe our epaper product line delivers unique functionality in many markets 
governments working to deploy egovernment initiatives  and companies in regulated industries such as aerospace  financial services  insurance  legal  and pharmaceutical those with paper intensive processes use adobe epaper solutions to ensure that their electronic documents are delivered reliably and securely  and can be viewed by the recipient in the exact form that the originator intended 
enterprises and governments that deploy adobe epaper solutions reduce paper and storage costs  improve customer satisfaction  and realize productivity and time to market gains 
based on the growth in the use of electronic document content  the increasing focus on egovernment initiatives  and the desire of enterprise customers to utilize xml and extend their businesses beyond the confines of their internal back end systems  we have increased our investment in our epaper business during fiscal these investments include enhancing our research and development strategy and our solutions based go to market capabilities 
in marketing and engineering  we have teams that focus on epaper desktop based software opportunities and on end to end server based epaper solution opportunities 
to supplement our solution offerings  we acquired accelio  a supplier of electronic forms and business process automation software solutions  in the second quarter of fiscal in our field organization  we realigned our resources throughout fiscal to focus more heavily on epaper opportunities 
our goal is to have a majority of our field based resources focused on epaper desktop and server based solutions targeting corporate and government accounts 
with the previously described emerging market trends  and with the addition of accelio derived solutions  adobe has refined its strategy to focus on three distinct epaper business opportunities in fiscal they are document generation  document collaboration  and document process management 
document generation there is a significant document generation market opportunity for transforming raw business data into visually rich  dynamic  customer focused documents for delivery anytime  anywhere  on any device 
in many cases  documents are the main source of interaction governments and businesses have with their constituents  partners  vendors  and customers 
documents are used to generate revenue such as catalogs  brochures  mailers  conduct transactions such as tax forms  invoices  loan documents and account statements  and transfer knowledge such as user manuals  product specifications and financial reports 
we believe the key to producing documents that drive business is an enterprise strength document generation solution that takes content from multiple sources  dynamically generates documents  and securely and reliably delivers those documents over a variety of systems and devices 
adobe s solutions for document generation are intended to improve customer satisfaction by enabling self serve dynamic document generation  anytime  anywhere  on any device  ensure that documents appear exactly as intended and are protected from unauthorized changes  and reduce costs by automating document and image production processes 
we provide both desktop and server based solutions for the document generation market 
on the desktop  adobe acrobat generates electronic documents from everyday office applications  such as microsoft office 
on servers  adobe offers a combination of products to generate documents  including adobe output server and adobe document server 
these server products merge output  including xml based data  from enterprise applications such as customer relationship management crm  enterprise resource planning erp  content management  and legacy systems with highly formatted document templates to generate personalized  reliable documents for print or electronic output 
we believe our key advantages in the document generation market include the standardization of pdf usage in many government agencies and regulated industries as a format for distributing  viewing  printing  and archiving electronic documents 
in addition  adobe s electronic document viewing solution  the acrobat reader  is available on many platforms  assuring our customers who generate pdf files that their content will be viewable and printable when it is distributed 
finally  from a technology standpoint  integration capabilities between xml based data and adobe pdf have made the pdf format a rich  intelligent document container one that allows electronic documents to be used on line and off line 
for example  adobe pdf based electronic forms can be filled in off line ie  when a user is not connected to the internet 
later  when the user reconnects to the internet  the data entered earlier can be automatically submitted electronically and integrated directly into back end is systems such as a co rporate database 
document collaboration the desire by governments and enterprises to have more effective and timely collaboration solutions has created a significant document collaboration market opportunity 
our solutions for document collaboration enable more secure and reliable distribution of documents to streamline document exchange  review  commenting  and approval  while protecting content from unauthorized access and alterations 
adobe pdf documents can also be automatically routed  tracked  and integrated into core applications such as document management systems to manage the full collaboration process 
benefits to customers using adobe solutions for document collaboration include the protection of business information and process integrity  the reduction of costs by automating collaborative processes and reducing paper  and the simplification of document sharing with employees  customers  partners  and other constituents 
governments can shorten the time it takes to approve applications 
enterprise customers can replace paper mailings to customers and suppliers with electronic document distribution  accelerate product and engineering documentation reviews  and streamline contract review and preparation 
in addition to the use of adobe acrobat reader and adobe acrobat as desktop software that is used as part of adobe s document collaboration solutions  adobe also provides server based solution software called adobe document server for reader extensions 
this new server product allows publishers of adobe pdf based forms and documents to embed usage rights in them that enable features in the free acrobat reader that normally are not available  such as form fill in and save  and digital signatures 
for example  governments can use this server solution to create on line forms that constituents can fill out and digitally sign in acrobat reader  or financial institutions can create electronic forms that are integrated with their back end systems to provide personalized on line applications 
in both examples  users can fill out such forms in the free acrobat reader  which later can be directly integrated with their processing systems  so that manual re keying of data is not necessary 
the cost saving advantages with such a solution for publishers of documents such as tax forms and on line applications are significant 
document process management enterprises have invested significantly in their infrastructure over the last ten years  resulting in the deployment of complex business systems such as crm  erp  and document content management dcm 
yet many of these back end systems are not fully connected with each other  or with how business users work with documents on their desktops on a daily basis 
this disconnected workflow has created a market opportunity called document process management  and we have created solutions that enable customers to integrate how they use electronic documents with their internal and external business processes 
with our solutions for document process management  an enterprise s customers  employees  and partners can submit information through intelligent  secure electronic forms via their preferred computer platform or device 
the captured information triggers rules and roles based workflow  automatically integrating data into core business systems such as crm  erp  and dcm 
for example  an employee could enter data on line into an expense report that is submitted electronically  the data could then be automatically integrated into the company s accounting system 
process tracking and reporting capabilities offer business managers insight into the status of their workflows  and allow them ways to further streamline their processes for better business performance 
customers using adobe s document process management solutions can reduce costs and improve responsiveness by eliminating inefficient manual  paper based processes 
they can extend the reach of their business processes to customers  partners  and mobile workers with self service applications via multiple devices 
the end result is often an increase in an enterprise s return on investment made on their back office solutions 
adobe s document process management solutions involve several components of its epaper software  including adobe acrobat reader and adobe acrobat on the desktop  and adobe document server for reader extensions on the server 
in addition  adobe provides adobe form client  adobe form server and adobe workflow server to complete its solution offering

we believe that competition on the macintosh platform with adobe premiere is difficult  based on apple s marketing and development advantage relative to their ownership and control of the macintosh operating system and hardware platform 
a number of companies currently offer one or more products that compete directly or indirectly with more than one of adobe s digital imaging and video products 
these companies include apple computer  microsoft  roxio  and ulead 
epaper as we broaden the scope of our epaper products and solutions  we face increased competition from entrenched office applications  pdf based clones of our acrobat product  electronic forms solution providers  emerging products technologies  and potentially  enterprise collaboration system providers 
additionally  current office applications and content creation management tools that use html  macromedia flash  microsoft word  tagged information file format tiff  and various xml based formats for electronic document distribution provide alternate solutions to customers  and indirectly compete with adobe s epaper products and the use of adobe pdf 
for document generation solutions specifically  the desktop and server based pdf file creation markets adobe acrobat and our server solutions such as adobe distiller server and adobe document server face competition from acrobat clone products such as those from ansyr technology  global graphics  and other smaller pdf creation solutions that can be found at a low cost  or for free  on the internet 
additional competitors in the document generation market include streamserver  optio  and formscape 
however  many pdf creation solutions in the market today use technology from us  licensed as adobe pdf libraries  to implement the pdf creation capabilities of their products or solutions 
we have recently announced our intent to provide different versions of our acrobat desktop product in to meet the needs of different types of users 
providing a pdf creation only version of acrobat may allow us to achieve our goal of broader proliferation of paid for acrobat software  as well as compete more effectively with low end pdf creation product companies such as global graphics 
the creation of a new high end professional version of acrobat could directly or indirectly position adobe against other creative professional pdf tool providers  such as enfocus  lantana  teampdf  and zinio 
for document collaboration and document process management solutions  where electronic document delivery  exchange  collaboration  and archival needs exist  our adobe epaper product family faces competition from entrenched office applications such as microsoft office 
in addition  some content management vendors provide collaboration and business process management capabilities that could directly or indirectly compete with our offerings  although we view our solutions in these areas as an extension of those supplied by such vendors 
in many of the epaper market opportunities that adobe is targeting  microsoft has  over the past few years  attempted to improve its products and their capabilities 
these areas include the collaborative document review  document security  and electronic document distribution capabilities of its office suite 
in addition  microsoft has recently announced new xml and 
net based product initiatives codenamed xdocs  eperiodicals  and jupiter that are positioned to be part of the launch of the next version of microsoft office 
these initiatives  targeted for availability  indicate microsoft may be planning to have new electronic form  electronic document distribution  ebook  and related functionality like that in adobe acrobat that could directly or indirectly compete with our epaper products that provide similar capabilities 
in addition to microsoft s xdocs initiative  we also face competition from cardiff  shana  and pureedge for electronic forms solutions 
similarly  we face competition for document process management solutions from workflow solutions vendors such as metastorm  staffware  and ultimus 
we believe the adobe epaper product family competes favorably against these companies and formats in terms of the combined benefits of superior functionality  file compression  visual page fidelity reliability  multi platform capability  printing and security of documents expressed using adobe pdf 
looking to the future  electronic document systems targeting enterprises that use emerging standards such as xml and microsoft s 
net initiative are being developed and will likely be adopted 
we are working to ensure that compatibility exists between these formats platforms and the adobe pdf format  as well as our acrobat software products and other adobe epaper applications 
oem postscript and other we believe that the principal competitive factors for oems in selecting a page description language or a printing technology are product capabilities  market leadership  reliability  price  support  and engineering development assistance 
we believe that our competitive advantages include our technology competency  oem customer relationships  and intellectual property portfolio 
adobe postscript faces competition from hewlett packard s proprietary pcl page description language  and from developers of other page description languages based on the postscript language standard  including global graphics and xionics 
although adobe has numerous oem customer relationships that license adobe postscript technologies  revenues from a small number of the oems make up a majority of the revenue in this market segment 
operations marketing and sales we market and distribute our products through sales channels  which include distributors  retailers  software developers  and  increasingly  systems integrators and value added resellers vars  as well as through oem and hardware bundle customers

we license our adobe postscript software and other printing systems technology to computer and printer manufacturers  who in turn distribute their products worldwide 
we derive a significant portion of adobe postscript royalties from international sales of printers  imagesetters  and other output devices by our oems 
we also license software with post contract customer support pcs 
an amount equal to the fair value of the pcs is deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the pcs period

investment in new markets we own limited partnership interests in four venture capital limited partnerships  adobe ventures lp  adobe ventures ii  lp  adobe ventures iii  lp  and adobe ventures iv  lp collectively adobe ventures  that invest in early stage companies with innovative technologies 
in addition to the potential for financial returns  our venture activities increase our knowledge of emerging markets and technologies  as well as expand our ecosystem of adobe products and services 
the partnerships are managed by granite ventures  an independent venture capital firm and sole general partner of adobe ventures 
the investments in adobe ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting  and accordingly  the investments are adjusted to reflect our share of adobe ventures investment income loss and dividend distributions 
under the terms of the partnership agreements  the general partner has the sole and exclusive right to manage and control the partnerships 
adobe as the limited partner has certain rights  including replacing the general partner and approving acquisitions that exceed certain established parameters 
however  these rights are considered to be protective rights and do not suggest an ability to control the partnerships 
adobe ventures carry their investments in equity securities at estimated fair market value and unrealized gains and losses are included in investment income loss on our consolidated statements of income 
the stock of a number of technology investments held by the limited partnerships at november  is not publicly traded  and  therefore  there is no establishe d market for their securities 
in order to determine the fair market value of these investments  we use the most recent round of financing involving new non strategic investors or estimates made by granite ventures based on their assessment of the current market value 
it is our policy to review the fair value of these investments held by adobe ventures on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of the investments in these companies 
this policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each companies cash position  financing needs  earnings revenue outlook  operational performance  management ownership changes  and competition 
the evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies  and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies 
if we believe that the carrying value of a co mpany is carried at an amount in excess of fair value  it is our policy to record a reserve in addition to our equity method of accounting 
in march  as part of our venture investing program  we established an internal limited partnership  adobe incentive partners  lp aip  which allowed certain of adobe s executive officers to participate in cash or stock distributions from adobe s venture investments 
in november  the partnership was liquidated 
immediately prior to the liquidation  assets held by aip included adobe s entire interests in adobe ventures lp and adobe ventures ii  lp and certain equity securities of privately held companies 
adobe was both the general partner and a limited partner of aip 
other limited partners were executive officers and former executive officers of adobe who were involved in adobe s venture investing activities and whose participation was deemed critical to the success of the program 
no limited partnership interests were granted in fiscal   or adobe s class a senior limited partnership interest in aip included both a liquidation preference and a preference in recovery of the cost basis of each specific investment 
the executives class b junior limited partnership interest qualified for partnership distributions only after a adobe had fully recovered the cost basis of its investment in the specific investee company for which a distribution was made  and b the participating executive had vested in his or her distribution rights 
the distribution rights generally vested on a monthly basis over three years  and were vested after one year  vested after two years and fully vested at the end of three years 
as of june   all existing partnership interests were fully vested or ceased vesting 
the limited partnership investments were restricted to investments in adobe ventures or in companies that were private at the time of the establishment of aip  or when the investment was made  whichever was later 
in fiscal  the current an d former participating officers received cash distributions with an aggregate fair value of million  including a million distribution related to the partnership liquidation 
at november   due to the partnership liquidation  there was no minority interest held by the participating officers

product development since the personal computer and enterprise software industries are characterized by rapid technological change  a continuous high level of expenditures is required for the enhancement of existing products and the development of new products 
we primarily develop our software internally 
we occasionally acquire products developed by others by purchasing the stock or assets of the business entity that held ownership rights to the technology 
in other instances  we have licensed or purchased the intellectual property ownership rights of programs developed by others with license or technology transfer agreements that may obligate us to pay royalties  typically based on a percentage of the revenues generated by those programs 
during fiscal years ended november   november  and december   our research and development expenses  including costs related to contract development  were million  million  and million  respectively 
on april   we acquired of the outstanding common stock of accelio 
accelio was a provider of web enabled solutions that helped customers manage business processes driven by electronic forms 
the acquisition of accelio enhances our ability to broaden our epaper solution business by combining accelio s electronic forms solutions with adobe acrobat and pdf technologies 
through this combination we can now extend acrobat solutions to enterprise users in global businesses  governments and educational institutions to deliver greater value to our customers 
the aggregate purchase price was million  which included the issuance of million shares of common stock of adobe  valued at million  and cash of million 
in december  we acquired fotiva  inc fotiva 
substantially all of fotiva s assets were intellectual property 
fotiva was a development stage software company that created solutions to help consumers manage  store  enrich  and share digital photographs and other related personal media 
in connection with the acquisition  substantially all of the purchase price of million cash was allocated to in process research and development and expensed at the time of acquisition due to the in process state of the technology 
at the date we acquired fotiva  it was estimated that of the development effort had been completed and that the remaining of the development effort would take approximately eleven months to complete 
the efforts required to complete the development of the technology primarily include finalization of coding  internationalization  and extensive quality assurance testing 
we developed a new product  adobe photoshop album  that we released in the first quarter of fiscal usi ng fotiva s image management technology with our digital imaging and epaper technologies 
during fiscal  we acquired glassbook  inc for a total consideration of approximately million 
based on an independent appraiser s valuation  million was allocated to in process research and development related to this acquisition 
the ongoing project at glassbook at the time of the purchase included the development of the glassbook reader and the glassbook content server products 
we released new products that contained the purchased technology in april  with acrobat ebook reader and adobe content server product protection we regard our software as proprietary and protect it under the laws of copyrights  patents  trademarks  and trade secrets 
we protect the source code of our software programs as trade secrets  and make source code available to third parties only under limited circumstances and specific security and confidentiality constraints 
our products are generally licensed to end users on a right to use basis pursuant to a license that restricts the use of the products to a designated number of printers or computers 
we also rely on copyright laws and on shrink wrap and electronic licenses that are not signed by the end user 
copyright protection may be unavailable under the laws of certain countries  however  and the enforceability of shrink wrap and electronic licenses has not been conclusively determined 
we have obtained many patents and have registered numerous copyrights  trademarks  domain names  and logos in the united states and foreign countries 
policing unauthorized use of computer software is difficult  and software piracy is a persistent problem for the software industry 
this problem is particularly acute in international markets 
we conduct vigorous anti piracy programs 
however  our products generally do not currently contain copy protection or network copy detection features 
employees as of january   we employed  people 
we have not experienced work stoppages and believe our employee relations are good 
competition in recruiting personnel in the software industry  especially highly skilled engineers  is extremely intense 
we believe our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to recruit and retain highly skilled technical  management and marketing personnel

amt had previously asserted that adobe had committed such breach of contract and violation of the dmca 
on september   adobe initiated arbitration proceedings in london  england the london arbitration against amt  seeking a declaration that adobe s distribution of font software that generates amt typefaces did not breach its contract pursuant to which it licensed certain rights with respect to amt typefaces 
amt has made a breach of contract claim in response to adobe s arbitration demand in the london arbitration  asserting that adobe wrongfully granted and or allowed third parties greater rights to distribute and embed amt fonts than adobe was licensed to grant and or allow 
if amt prevails on its breach of contract claims  amt may have the right to terminate adobe s right to distribute any of its products that then still contain font software that generates amt typefaces 
adobe asserts that it negotiated for and obtained express  written licenses from both amt and itc approximately ten years ago permitting adobe to allow end users to embed amt and itc fonts in electronic documents for print and view and disputes the other breach of contract claims 
adobe also asserts that adobe acrobat  which amt and itc correctly acknowledge has been superceded by version  neither violates the dmca nor induces or contributes to the infringement of copyrights in itc s and amt s truetype font software 
on september   amt and itc filed suit against adobe in the us district court  eastern district of illinois the illinois action against adobe  asserting only that adobe s distribution of the superceded version of adobe acrobat violated the dmca  as described above 
the illinois action seeks statutory damages of  for each copy of acrobat found to violate the dmca  a claim that adobe disputes as a matter of law and fact 
the illinois action also seeks injunctive relief with respect to acrobat  although it specifically alleges  correctly  that adobe no longer distributes acrobat on november   itc filed another suit against adobe in the united states district court for the eastern district of illinois the second illinois action  this time asserting that adobe breached its contract with itc and that itc  and not adobe  owns the copyrights in font software created by adobe which generates itc typefaces 
amt and itc made a motion to dismiss the california action  challenging jurisdiction and venue 
that motion was granted by the court on december  as such  the parties respective claims will be resolved in the other actions described above 
the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain  and amt and itc may assert other claims 
adobe cannot assure that it will be able to successfully defend itself against any of the actions described above 
amt and itc seek an unspecified aggregate dollar amount of damages 
a favorable outcome for amt or itc in these actions could have a material adverse effect on adobe s business  financial condition and operating results 
we strongly believe that all of amt s and itc s claims are without merit  and will vigorously defend against them in addition to pursuing our own claims as described above 
on september   plaintiff fred b 
dufresne filed suit against adobe  microsoft corporation  macromedia  inc  and trellix corporation in the us district court  district of massachusetts  alleging infringement of us patent no 
 entitled client server system using embedded hypertext tags for application and database development 
the plaintiff s complaint asserts that defendants have infringed  and continue to infringe one or more claims of the patent by making  using  selling and or offering for sale  inter alia  products supporting microsoft active server pages technology 
the plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory damages  preliminary and permanent injunctive relief  trebling of damages for willful infringement  and fees and costs 
adobe strongly disagrees with the plaintiff s claims and intends to vigorously defend against this action 
on november   plaintiffs shell slate software corporation and ben weiss filed a civil action in the us district court in los angeles against the company alleging false designation of origin  trade secret misappropriation  breach of contract  and other causes of action 
the claim derives from the plaintiffs belief that the healing brush technique of adobe photoshop incorporates plaintiffs trade secrets 
plaintiffs seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief  compensatory  treble  and punitive damages  and fees and costs 
we believe that the action has no merit and intend to defend vigorously against it 
from time to time adobe is involved in lawsuits  claims  investigations and proceedings  in addition to those identified above  consisting of intellectual property  commercial  employment and other matters  which arise in the ordinary course of business 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  adobe makes a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
these provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations  settlements  rulings  advice of legal counsel  and other information and events pertaining to a particular case 
litigation is inherently unpredictable 
however  adobe believes that it has valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against it  as well as adequate provisions for any probable and estimable losses 
it is possible  nevertheless  that cash flows or results of operations could be affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies

in addition  our recently acquired accelio business focusing on electronic forms is included in our epaper segment 
the oem postscript and other segment includes printing technology to create and print simple or visually rich docu ments with precision 
revenue from our graphics segment is derived primarily from the licensing of the following application products photoshop  illustrator  adobe premiere  photoshop elements  after effects  adobe graphics server formerly called adobe altercast  digital video collection  adobe photodeluxe  atmosphere  and livemotion 
cross media publishing includes the following application products web collection  golive  design collection  adobe publishing collection  pagemaker  framemaker  adobe type products  indesign  adobe creative suites  adobe content server  ebooks  and pressready

the former cross media publishing segment has been renamed the creative professional segment and includes two products that were formerly included in our graphics segment  adobe illustrator and adobe graphics server formerly called adobe altercast 
there were no changes to our epaper and oem postscript and other segments 
the management discussion and analysis that follows is based on our segment reporting that was in effect throughout fiscal for more information on both our old and new segment reporting  please refer to note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
products fiscal revenue compared to fiscal revenue during fiscal  our products revenue decreased  or million  compared to fiscal  primarily due to continued economic weakness in asia  europe  and the us  as well as declines in revenue from our graphics  cross media publishing  and oem postscript and other segments  for reasons explained below 
revenue from our graphics segment decreased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the annual decrease in revenue in our graphics segment was primarily due to a year over year decline in our illustration software revenue  due to product lifecycle timing and the continued economic impact on creative professional customers  who are the main end user market for this software 
we also experienced a overall decline in our digital imaging software revenue  which includes the adobe photoshop  adobe photoshop elements  and adobe photodeluxe products 
we believe the decline in digital imaging software is due to a combination of the economic weakness across the world  the impact of lower marketing spending by corporations resulting in a reduced number of creative professional customers  and the trend of our customers migrating towards the purchasing of adobe collection products as opposed to individual products 
in addition  we experienced a year over y ear revenue decline in our digital video software licensing  which is made up of our adobe premiere  adobe after effects  and our adobe digital video collection products  due to product lifecycle timing and the economic impact on the digital video software market 
revenue from our cross media publishing segment decreased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the annual decrease in revenue from our cross media publishing segment during fiscal compared to fiscal was due to multiple factors 
in the web publishing segment  we experienced a decline in revenue from our web focused products adobe golive and the adobe web collection 
we attribute this decline to weakness in the web publishing segment and less sales and marketing emphasis 
in addition  we experienced a year over year decline in our business publishing revenue  which is derived from our pagemaker and adobe publishing collection products 
we attribute this decline to the weaker global economy in when compared to  the adoption of our adobe design collection product especially by creative professionals instead of the adobe publishing collection product  and less sales and marketing emphasis 
finally  we experienced a year o ver year decline in type and technical publishing products  which includes our adobe framemaker product  due to overall economic weakness in the geographic markets in which these products are used 
the decrease in revenue from these cross media products in fiscal compared to fiscal was partially offset by a increase in revenue in our professional layout publishing products  which includes revenue from our indesign  adobe design collection  and adobe creative suites products 
we attribute this revenue increase to increased marketing activities and growing customer demand 
revenue from our oem postscript and other segment decreased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to the following factors continued weakness in the print business  lower average selling prices generating less royalties from certain oem customers  and smaller oem customers transferring to clone postscript technologies 
revenue from this segment has declined over the last few years and we expect this trend to continue  but if it significantly exceeds our expectations  it may harm our future results 
the decrease in revenue from the above mentioned segments in fiscal compared to fiscal was partially offset by an increase of million  or  in our epaper solutions segment 
this segment increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to a increase in acrobat revenue in the us and an increase in revenue of million from our newly acquired accelio business 
fiscal revenue compared to fiscal revenue during fiscal  our overall product revenue decreased  or million  compared to fiscal  primarily due to adverse economic conditions  especially in the us  and a decline in revenue from our graphics  cross media publishing  and oem postscript and other segments for the reasons explained below 
revenue from our graphics segment decreased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we attribute this decrease in graphics segment revenue primarily to severe economic pressure on the creative professional and consumer markets  as well as product lifecycle timing and the decline in spending on web focused software tools 
as a result of these factors  we experienced an decrease in our digital imaging software revenue and a decrease in our illustration software revenue when comparing fiscal to fiscal the declines in our fiscal graphics business were partially offset by a year over year revenue increase in our digital video software products 
growth in our digital video software revenue was driven by new updates of our products in fiscal revenue from our cross media publishing segment decreased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the largest factors contributing to the cross media publishing segment revenue decline were a year over year decline in our web publishing software revenue due to weakness in the web layout and web animation products market  a year over year decline in type and technical publishing products due to product lifecycle timing and overall economic weakness in the geographic markets in which these products are used  and a decline in our business publishing software revenue due to the adoption of our adobe design collection product especially by creative professionals instead of our adobe publishing collection product 
the declines in our fiscal cross media publishing segment were partially offset by a year over year revenue increase from our professional page layout publishing products due to increased marketing and promotional activities for these products throughout the year 
revenue from our oem postscript and other segment decreased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to the following factors continued weakness in the print business  renegotiated pricing with certain oem customers  and the outsourcing of certain oem accounts to a third party solution provider 
the decrease in revenue from the above mentioned segments in fiscal compared to fiscal was partially offset by an increase of  or million  in our epaper solutions segment  as it increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to the release of our acrobat product in the second quarter of fiscal  as well as the continuing movement from paper based processes to electronic workflows by enterprises and government agencies which contributed to broader adoption of our epaper products 
services and support services and support is composed of professional services such as consulting services and training and support such as maintenance and technical support primarily related to the products we acquired from accelio 
professional services revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method and is measured monthly based primarily on input measures  such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete  with consideration given to output measures  such as contract milestones  when applicable 
our professional services revenue depends in large part on our software license revenue from the products that we acquired from accelio 
a significant portion of our support revenue is composed of our extended enterprise maintenance and support offerings  which entitles customers to receive product upgrades and enhancements during the term of the maintenance and support period  which is typically one year 
our support revenue depends on both our software license revenue and ren ewals of our maintenance agreements 
our support revenue also includes support for our desktop products whereby adobe offers a range of support programs  from fee based incident to annual support contracts  and developer support to partners and developer organizations 
for fiscal  our services and support revenue increased million  or  compared to fiscal solely due to the acquisition of the accelio business in april geographic and platform information we categorize our geographic results into three major market regions the americas  emea  and asia 
revenue generated in the americas  emea  and asia as a percentage of total revenue is presented below americas emea asia the decrease in the percent of revenue from asia and corresponding increase in the americas in compared to was primarily due to weakness in the japan economy 
the decrease in the americas in fiscal compared to was primarily due to adverse economic conditions  especially in the us overall  revenue from our application products on the windows and macintosh platforms decreased and  respectively  in fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal compared to fiscal  revenue from our application products on the windows platform increased  and revenue from our application products on the macintosh platform decreased during the same period 
in fiscal  the windows and macintosh platforms accounted for and  respectively  of application products revenue  excluding platform independent and unix products  compared to and  respectively  in fiscal  and and  respectively  in fiscal we expect the trend towards the windows platform to continue in the foreseeable future 
cost of revenue change change cost of revenue products services and support total cost of revenue percentage of total revenue products cost of products revenue includes product packaging  third party royalties  excess and obsolete inventory  amortization related to localization costs and acquired technologies  hosted server costs  and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products 
cost of products revenue increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to increased amortization of website development costs related to adobe design team formerly adobe studio which launched in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the subsequent impairment charge for the remaining adobe design team development costs due to the decision to discontinue the adobe design team service in the third quarter of fiscal cost of products revenue decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to an decrease in third party royalties  mainly associated with our postscript and type products revenue  and a decrease in material costs due to decreased product licensing of shrink wrapped products 
these decreases were offset by a increase in localization costs primarily due to localization for our photoshop and acrobat products  a increase in excess and obsolete inventory expenses  and a increase in hosted server costs due to the launch of adobe design team formerly adobe studio 
services and support cost of services and support is composed primarily of employee related costs and the related infrastructure costs incurred to provide consulting services  training  and product support for our accelio business 
cost of services and support increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the acquisition of the accelio business in april operating expenses research and development change change research and development percentage of total revenue research and development expenses consist principally of salary and benefit expenses for software developers  contracted development efforts  related facilities costs  and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development 
research and development expenses increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher compensation and related benefits related to headcount growth from the acquisition of accelio to support product development efforts 
research and development expenses decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal of the change  was due to a decrease in compensation and related benefits due to lower incentive compensation expenses and was due to a decrease in contractor and professional fees as less development work was performed through outside sources 
we believe that investments in research and development  including the recruiting and hiring of software developers  are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products 
we will continue to focus on long term opportunities available in our end markets and make significant investments in the development of our desktop application and server based software products 
sales and marketing change change sales and marketing percentage of total revenue sales and marketing expenses include salary and benefit expenses  sales commissions  travel expenses  and related facilities costs for our sales  marketing  customer support  order management  and order fulfillment personnel 
sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue  such as advertising  trade shows  public relations  and other market development programs 
sales and marketing expenses decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to decreased marketing and advertising spending 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily made up of a increase from marketing spending  which was partially offset by a decrease from compensation and related benefits due to lower incentive compensation 
general and administrative change change general and administrative percentage of total revenue general and administrative expenses consist principally of salary and benefit expenses  travel expenses  and related facilities costs for our finance  human resources  legal  information services  and executive personnel 
general and administrative expenses also include outside legal and accounting fees  provision for bad debts  and expenses associated with computer equipment and software used in the administration of the business 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily made up of from a decrease in contractor and professional fees  from a decrease in facility expenses due to lower rent expenses  and from a decrease in compensation and related benefits due to reduced headcount 
these decreases were partially offset by a increase from higher depreciation expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily made up of from a decrease in bad debt expense related to enhanced global credit evaluations  on going risk mitigation efforts such as letters of credit  guarantees  and credit insurance in asia  and improved collections of our royalty accounts 
this decrease was partially offset by a increase from higher legal fees due to litigation and a increase from facility expenses due to higher utility costs 
restructuring and other charges change change restructuring and other charges percentage of total revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we incurred a restructuring charge of million  which included severance and related charges and the closure of a facility 
the related restructuring program eliminated engineering  sales and marketing  and general and administrative positions worldwide in order to realign our resources for our future business plans 
these plans include adding resources to support our epaper enterprise business in fiscal the restructuring program is expected to be completed in fiscal of the million in charges  million remained accrued at november  in the second quarter of fiscal  we implemented a restructuring program to eliminate redundant sales and marketing positions  held by adobe employees worldwide  as a result of the acquisition of accelio 
the restructuring included severance and related charges associated with the reduction in force and the cost of vacating a leased facility 
total restructuring charges were million and the majority of these payments were paid in the second quarter of fiscal of the million in charges  
million remains accrued at november  the remaining payments will be paid in the first quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we paid our remaining obligations under our restructuring program 
we also lowered our estimate of the total costs associated with the restructuring program  resulting in an adjustment of approximately million 
the adjustment primarily reflected lower than estimated relocation and severance expenses and related charges 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we implemented a restructuring plan to realign our workforce to our future strategic goals and to align our resources with our lower fiscal revenue targets due to adverse economic conditions resulting in part from the events of september  this restructuring enabled us to increase our investment in digital imaging  digital video  and epaper based businesses in fiscal as part of the restructuring program  we implemented a reduction in force of positions  affecting organizations throughout the company 
the reductions came predominantly from sales and marketing and in our north american operations  and as of november   the majority of these terminations were completed 
the restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal was million  all of which related to severance and related charges associated with the reduction in force 
as of november   there was no restructuring liability remaining for our fiscal year rest ructuring program 
for more information  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  restructuring and other charges consisted of million of other charges relating to the disposal of certain equipment and one time litigation related expenses  and a credit of million related to the fiscal and fiscal restructuring programs 
the million credit was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal  as we revised our estimates of the total costs associated with the fiscal and restructuring programs 
the credit primarily reflected lower than estimated severance and related charges attributable to employees whose positions were eliminated as a result of the restructurings but who were able to find alternative employment within adobe 
the remaining credit was due to lower than expected charges related to vacating leased facilities 
acquired in process research and development change change acquired in process research and development percentage of total revenue on april   we acquired of the outstanding common stock of accelio corporation 
accelio was a provider of web enabled solutions that help customers manage business processes driven by electronic forms 
we obtained an independent appraiser s valuation to determine the amounts allocated to purchased technology and in process research and development 
the valuation analysis utilized the income approach that takes into consideration discounted future cash flows 
based on this valuation million was allocated to in process research and development 
the amount allocated to in process research and development of million was expensed as of the date of the acquisition due to the state of the development of certain products and the uncertainty of the technology 
in december  we acquired fotiva  inc fotiva 
substantially all of fotiva s assets were intellectual property 
fotiva was a development stage software company that created solutions to help consumers manage  store  enrich  and share digital photographs and other related personal media 
in connection with the acquisition  substantially all of the purchase price of million cash was allocated to in process research and development and expensed at the time of acquisition due to the in process state of the technology 
at the date we acquired fotiva  it was estimated that of the development effort had been completed and that the remaining of the development effort would take approximately eleven months to complete 
the efforts required to complete the development of the technology primarily include finalization of coding  internationalization  and extensive quality assurance testing 
we developed a new product  adobe photoshop album  that we released in the first quarter of fiscal using fotiva s image management technology with our digital imaging and epaper technologies 
in fiscal  we recorded million of acquired in process research and development related to our acquisition of glassbook  inc glassbook 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
apb 
based on an independent appraiser s valuation  million of the total million purchase price was allocated to in process research and development due to the state of the development and the uncertainty of the technology 
the ongoing projects at glassbook at the time of the purchase included the development of the glassbook reader and the glassbook content server products 
we released new products that contained the purchased technology in april  with acrobat ebook reader and adobe content server amortization and impairment of goodwill and purchased intangibles change change amortization and impairment of goodwill and purchased intangibles percentage of total revenue amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge for the remaining book value of the glassbook acquisition 
the impairment charge was determined based on discounted future cash flows 
as part of the acquisition of accelio in april  we allocated million to goodwill which  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  will not be amortized 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we revised our estimate of certain costs associated with our acquisition of accelio  resulting in an increase to goodwill of approximately million 
the adjustment primarily reflected higher than estimated transaction costs and costs related to closing redundant facilities 
the goodwill associated with the acquisitions of accelio and golive will be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to a full year of amortization of glassbook goodwill totaling million and purchased intangibles of million 
nonoperating income loss investment gain loss change change investment gain loss percentage of total revenue investment gain loss consists principally of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments  other than temporary declines in the value of marketable equity securities  and equity method gains and losses of adobe ventures 
during fiscal  investment losses consisted of other than temporary writedowns related to our marketable equity securities in digitalthink  inc  tumbleweed communications corp  engage  inc  virage  inc  viewpoint corporation  avantgo  inc  and salon media group  inc 
formerly salon 
com of million 
these losses were partially offset by gains totaling million from the sale of our marketable equity securities 
we also recorded net investment losses related to investments in adobe ventures and our cost method investments totaling million 
as of november   our short term investments included marketable equity securities of million and our long term investments included investments in adobe ventures and other cost method investments of million 
these securities are inherently risky and we may experience further deterioration in fair value in the future 
during fiscal  investment losses consisted of other than temporary writedowns related to our marketable equity securities in tumbleweed communications corp  salon media group  inc formerly salon

and digimarc corporation for million and million  respectively 
additionally  we recorded investment gains totaling million related to the mark to market valuation adjustment for avantgo  inc and other net gains totaling approximately million related to various other adobe ventures investments activities 
these gains were partially offset by investment losses related to the writedown of our investments in engage  inc  classmates online  inc formerly ecircles  inc  salon media group  inc 
formerly salon 
com  and impresse corporation  totaling approximately million 
we are uncertain of future investment gains or losses as they are primarily dependent upon the operations of the underlying investee companies and market valuations 
interest and other income change change interest and other income percentage of total revenue interest and other income consists principally of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  gains and losses on the sale of fixed income investments  foreign exchange transaction gains and losses and realized gains or losses on the disposal of assets 
interest and other income decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a decrease in interest income of million due to lower interest rates and lower realized gains of million resulting from the sales of fixed income investments 
the decreases in interest and other income in fiscal compared to fiscal were partially offset by a reduction in losses of million related to the lowered cost of purchased options used in foreign currency hedging 
interest and other income increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to realized gains of million resulting from the sale of fixed income investments 
interest and other income also increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to higher average cash balances resulting in an increase in interest income of million 
the increase in interest and other income in fiscal compared to fiscal was partially offset by foreign currency losses of million 
these foreign currency losses resulted from the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and subsequent recording of the cost of hedging foreign currency exposures in interest and other income 
in addition  in fiscal  interest and other income increased due to a one time gain of million from the sale of a corporate facility in edinburgh  scotland 
income tax provision change change income tax provision percentage of total revenue effective tax rate our effective tax rate decreased in fiscal from fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal  due to tax benefits associated with the restructuring of our international operations 
part of the tax rate decrease in fiscal year was offset by a tax rate increase  approximately  due to the non tax deductible goodwill impairment expense 
factors that may affect our future performance we believe that in the future our results of operations could be affected by various factors  including adverse changes in general economic or political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business introduction of new products by existing and new competitors  particularly microsoft delays in shipment of our new products or major new versions of existing products difficulties in transitions to new markets  including the enterprise  government  corporate business and consumer markets inability to attract and retain key personnel lack of market acceptance of new products and upgrades weakness in demand for application software  computers  and printers downward sales price adjustments intellectual property disputes and litigation industry transitions to new business models renegotiation or termination of royalty or intellectual property licensing arrangements changes in accounting rules market risks associated with our equity investments as discussed later under quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we periodically provide operating model targets for revenue  expenses  gross margin  operating profit  other income  tax rate  and share count 
we use these targets to assist us in making decisions about our allocation of resources and investments  not as predictions of future results 
the targets reflect a number of assumptions  including assumptions about product pricing and demand manufacturing costs and volumes the mix of application products and licensing revenue  full and upgrade products  distribution channels  and geographic distribution no change occurring in the global market conditions affecting our customers these and many other factors described in this report affect our financial performance and may cause our future results  including results for the current quarter  to vary materially from these targets or from results for prior periods 
in particular  the slow down in some geographic areas  primarily in the us  europe  and japan  has adversely affected all of our product segments and may adversely affect our ability to achieve our targets 
we attribute this slow down  which is affecting all of our product segments  to continued economic weakness 
these adverse economic conditions in the us  europe  japan  and potentially other geographic markets may continue in the short term  and they may continue to adversely affect our revenue and earnings 
although there are also adverse conditions in other countries  these other countries represent a much smaller portion of our revenue and thus have less impact on our operational results 
furthermore  if the economic slow down worsens or spreads to other geograph ic areas where we do business  it would likely cause our future results  including results for the current quarter  to vary materially from our targets 
in addition  political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business may adversely affect our business 
the end markets for our software products are intensely and increasingly competitive and are significantly affected by product introductions and market activities of industry competitors 
in the epaper applications market  a number of competitors have developed and brought to market clones of our acrobat application to create and enhance pdf files 
through lower pricing and aggressive marketing to existing or potential adobe customers  these competitors could impact adobe acrobat average seat pricing  and our overall epaper revenue 
additionally  any incorporation into an operating system of software for the creation of pdf files  or other software that competes with our epaper or graphics applications  could seriously harm our business 
furthermore  microsoft has increased its presence in the low end and mid range consumer digital imaging graphics markets  as well as indicating that it may include new electronic form  electronic document distribution  ebook and related functionality like that i n adobe acrobat and our server based epaper software  including announcing a new electronic forms tool that is planned to ship in mid we believe that  due to microsoft s market dominance  any new microsoft products in these markets will be highly competitive with our products 
if competing graphics or epaper products achieve widespread acceptance  our operating results would suffer 
in addition  consolidation has occurred among some of the competitors in our markets 
any further consolidations among competitors of ours may result in stronger competitors and may therefore harm our results of operations 
also  as we seek to further broaden our customer base in the enterprise  government  corporate business and consumer markets  we may not successfully adapt our application software licensing and distribution channels  which could cause our operating results to suffer 
as we currently have limited experience in these markets  we believe we will need to recruit  train  and retain personnel with experience in these markets  and our failure to do so may harm our ability to penetrate these markets 
we could also experience decreases in average selling prices and some transitions in our distribution channels that could seriously harm our business 
in connection with the accelio acquisition  we may not be successful in integrating accelio or developing  marketing or licensing products  particularly products for the enterprise  government  corporate business and consumer markets  based on accelio s technology or expertise 
we also may not be successful in integrating its distribution channels with ours  or in dev eloping the necessary relationships with enough significant systems integrators to succeed with these new customer bases 
additionally  we may face unanticipated expenses relating to the integration of accelio personnel and its products  distribution channels  and administrative functions 
all of these factors may affect our realizability of accelio s assets  including goodwill 
we plan to recruit key talent for our future growth  especially to support our enterprise business 
these plans to continue to invest in certain areas will require us to continue to hire additional employees 
competition for high quality personnel  especially highly skilled engineers  is extremely intense 
our ability to effectively manage this growth will require us to continue to improve our operational and financial controls and information management systems  and to attract  retain  motivate  and manage employees effectively  otherwise our business could be seriously harmed 
we rely on our ability to grant stock options in order to recruit and retain highly skilled employees in a competitive environment 
the proposed requirement that stockholder approval would be required for the adoption of all stock option plans and for any material modifications to such plans  as well as the potential requirement to recognize an expense for stock options in our financial statements  may result in our inability to provide adequate incentives to effectively recruit and retain talented employees 
any delays or failures in developing and marketing our products  including upgrades of current products that successfully adapt to changing customer needs  may also have a harmful impact on our results of operations 
our ability to extend our core technologies into new applications and new platforms and to anticipate or respond to technological changes could affect our ability to develop these products 
a portion of our future revenue will come from these new applications 
delays in product or upgrade introductions could cause a decline in our revenue  earnings  or stock price 
we cannot determine the ultimate effect that these new products or upgrades will have on our revenue or results of operations 
we offer our application based products primarily on macintosh and windows platforms  and on some unix platforms 
we generally offer our server based products  but not desktop products  on the linux platform as well as the three platforms mentioned above 
to the extent that there is a slow down of customer purchases of personal computers on either the windows or macintosh platform or in general  or to the extent that significant demand arises for our products or competitive products on the linux desktop platform before we choose and are able to offer our products on this platform  our business could be harmed 
we distribute our application products primarily through distributors  resellers  retailers  and increasingly  systems integrators and vars collectively referred to as distributors 
a significant amount of our revenue for application products is from two distributors 
in addition  our channel program now focuses our efforts on larger distributors  which has resulted in our dependence on a relatively small number of distributors selling through a large amount of our products 
sales through the distribution channel result in unstable pricing and significant product returns 
our distributors sell our competitors products  if our distributors favor our competitors products for any reason  they may fail to market our products as effectively or to devote resources necessary to provide effective sales  and in that case  our results would suffer 
additionally  one of our goals is to increase our direct distribution of our products to end users through our online store located on our website at www 
adobe 
com 
any such increase in our direct revenue efforts will place us in increased competition with our channel distributors and with newer types of distribution of our products by online  internet based resellers 
in addition  we continue to expand into third party distribution channels  including vars and systems integrators  in our effort to further broaden our customer base 
as a result  the financial health of these third parties and our continuing relationships with them are becoming more important to our success 
some of these companies may be unable to withstand changes in business conditions 
our business could be seriously harmed if the financial condition of some of these third parties substantially weakens or if our relationships with them deteriorate 
in connection with the enforcement of our own intellectual property rights or in connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third party rights  we have been  are currently  and may in the future be subject to complex  protracted litigation or negotiations as part of our policy to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights  including rights derived from third party licensors 
intellectual property litigation is typically very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel 
although we have successfully defended or resolved past litigation and disputes  we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes 
adverse decisions in such litigation or disputes could have negative results  including subjecting us to significant liabilities  requiring us to seek licenses from others  preventing us from manufacturing or licensing certain of our products  or causing sever e disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete  any one of which could seriously harm our business 
our computer network and applications could be adversely impacted by malicious code such as worms and viruses  which are released into the public internet using recently discovered vulnerabilities in popular software programs 
although we have a response team that is notified of high risk malicious events from multiple sources and we take certain preventative measures  these procedures may not be sufficient to avoid harm to our business 
in some markets and for some products  we have adopted a strategy aiming to increase our market share where it is low and therefore may receive significantly less revenue from certain licensing arrangements than we otherwise would receive for licensing these products 
increased market penetration may in fact lead to lower revenue growth in these areas 
while we believe that this potential market share increase will ultimately benefit us  this strategy could instead harm our business through reduced revenue growth 
we currently rely on five turnkey assemblers of our products  with at least two turnkeys located in each major region we serve 
if any significant turnkey assembler terminates its relationship with us  or if our supply from any significant turnkey is interrupted or terminated for any other reason  we may not have enough time or be able to replace the supply of products manufactured by that turnkey assembler to avoid serious harm to our business 
revenue from our oem postscript and other segment experienced a decline in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of a decline in the print business 
we expect this segment to continue to decline in fiscal relative to fiscal  which may harm our business if the magnitude of the decline significantly exceeds our expectations 
the continuing weakness in the economy is contributing to the decrease in revenue for the monochrome laser printers market  in addition to the decline in average selling prices of monochrome laser printers and the increasing use of inkjet printers 
if a current major customer decided to incorporate a clone version instead of adobe postscript technology  it could seriously harm our business 
further  oem partners on occasion seek to renegotiate their royalty arrangements 
we evaluate these requests on a case by case basis 
if an agreement is not reached  a customer may decide to pursue other options  which could result in lower licensing revenue for us 
the internet market is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants that have introduced or developed products addressing authoring and communication over the internet 
as is typical in the case of a new and evolving industry  demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
the industry for software that addresses authoring and communications over the internet is still developing 
standards defining web graphics have not yet been fully adopted 
in addition  new models for licensing software will be needed to accommodate new information delivery practices 
the new models may be less lucrative for us than our existing business models 
moreover  critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet including security  reliability  ease of use and access  cost  and quality of service remain unresolved and may affect the growth of internet use  together with the software standards and electronic media employed in such markets 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue and operating income from our customers located in europe and japan 
we generally experience lower revenue from our european operations in the third quarter because many customers reduce their purchasing activities in the summer months 
we are uncertain whether the recent currency appreciation experienced in europe and japan will continue in the foreseeable future 
our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
dramatic fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may have significant financial impact 
we attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging  based on our best judgment of the appropriate trade offs among risk  opportunity  and expense 
we have established a hedging program to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  primarily of the japanese yen and the euro 
we regularly review our hedging program and will make adjustments based on our best judgment 
our hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles are subject to interpretation by the american institute of certified public accountants the aicpa  the securities and exchange commission the sec  and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced 
our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows software revenue recognition stock option grants and accounting for stock options accounting for business combinations accounting for variable interest entities goodwill and other intangible assets accounting in particular  new fasb guidelines relating to accounting for goodwill could make our acquisition related charges less predictable in any given reporting period 
it is possible that in the future  we may incur less frequent  but larger  impairment charges related to goodwill we have already recorded  as well as goodwill arising out of potential future acquisitions 
see recent accounting pronouncements for more information on this new fasb guideline 
changes to these rules or the questioning of current practices may have a significant adverse effect on our reported financial results or in the way in which we conduct our business 
see the discussion under critical accounting policies below for additional information about our critical accounting policies and some risks associated with these policies 
we hold equity investments that have recently experienced significant declines in market value 
we also have investments  and may continue to make future investments  in several privately held companies  many of which can still be considered in the start up or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky  as the market for the technologies or products they have under development is typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
our investment activities can impact our net income 
we recorded pre tax losses from marketable securities and other investments in privately held companies of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
these amounts reflect realized losses from the sale of marketable equity investments  other than temporary declines in the value of marketable equity securities  and net investment losses related to investments in adobe ventures and our cost method investments 
in fiscal and  decreases in the market prices of these securities resulted in a decrease in our pre tax income 
future price fluctuations in these securities and any significant long term declines in value could reduce our net income in future periods 
we are uncertain of future investment gains and losses  as they are primarily dependent upon the operations of the underlying investee companies 
due to the factors noted above  our future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings  or any delay in the release of any product or upgrade  compared to analysts or investors expectations could cause  and has caused in the past  an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our common stock 
additionally  we may not learn of such shortfalls or delays until late in the fiscal quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and greater decline in the trading price of our common stock 
finally  we participate in a highly dynamic industry 
in addition to factors specific to us  changes in analysts earnings estimates for us or our industry and factors affecting the corporate environment  our industry  or the securities markets in general will often result in significant volatility of our common stock price 
critical accounting policies we have identified the following as critical accounting policies to our company revenue recognition  accounting for our marketable and non marketable fixed income and equity securities  accounting for leases of property and equipment  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition we recognize application products revenue upon shipment  net of estimated returns  provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain 
application products revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing limited rights of return  rebates  and price protection 
accordingly  we reduce revenue recognized for estimated future returns  price protection  and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of returns  inventory levels in the distribution channel  and other related factors 
we provide free technical phone support for our shrink wrapped application products to customers who are under warranty for support 
we record the estimated cost of free technical phone support upon shipment of software 
we also license software in multiple element arrangements in which a customer purchases a combination of software  post contract customer support pcs  and or professional services 
pcs  or maintenance  includes rights to upgrades  when and if available  telephone support  updates  and enhancements 
professional services relate to consulting services and training 
when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all elements in a multiple element arrangement  revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements 
vsoe of fair value is established by the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
we determine vsoe of fair value of pcs based on renewal rates for the same term pcs 
in a multiple element arrangement whereby vsoe of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but vsoe of fair value does not exist for one or more delivered elements  revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the f air value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue  assuming delivery has occurred and collectibility is probable 
revenue allocated to pcs is recognized ratably over the contractual term typically one to two years 
the arrangement fees related to fixed priced consulting contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method 
percentage of completion is measured monthly based primarily on input measures  such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete  with consideration given to output measures  such as contract milestones  when applicable 
anticipated losses on fixed priced contracts are recognized in the period when they become known 
we record oem licensing revenue  primarily royalties  when oem partners ship products incorporating adobe software  provided collection of such revenue is deemed probable 
deferred revenue includes customer advances under oem licensing agreements and maintenance revenue 
in cases where we will provide a specified free upgrade to an existing product  we defer revenue until the future obligation is fulfilled 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require collateral 
we maintain allowances for estimated credit losses 
accounting for our marketable and non marketable fixed income and equity securities we classify all of our cash equivalents and short term investments that are free of trading restrictions  or become free of trading restrictions within one year  as available for sale 
we carry these investments at fair value  based on quoted market prices  and unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  are included in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses are recognized when realized in our consolidated statements of income 
the market prices in our short term equity investments have been volatile in the past 
it is our policy to review our equity holdings on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
our policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each of the companies cash position  earnings revenue outlook  stock price performance over the past six months  liquidity and management ownership 
if we believe that an other than temporary decline exists in one of our marketable equity securities  it is our policy to write down these equity investments to the market value and record the related writedown as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of income 
the ultimate value realized on these equity investments is subject to market volatility until they are sold 
for further information on our cash equivalents and short term investments  please refer to note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
our long term investments include direct investments and indirect investments in privately held companies 
we own limited partnership interests in four venture capital limited partnerships  adobe ventures lp  adobe ventures ii  lp  adobe ventures iii  lp  and adobe ventures iv  lp collectively adobe ventures  that invest in early stage companies with innovative technologies 
in addition to the potential for financial returns  our venture activities increase our knowledge of emerging markets and technologies  as well as expand our ecosystem of adobe products and services 
the partnerships are managed by granite ventures  an independent venture capital firm and sole general partner of adobe ventures 
the investments in adobe ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting  and accordingly  the investments are adjusted to reflect our share of adobe ventures investment income loss and dividend distributions 
under the terms of the partnership agreements  the general partner has the sole and exclusive right to manage and control the partnerships 
adobe as the limited partner has certain rights  including replacing the general partner and approving acquisitions that exceed certain established parameters 
however  these rights are considered to be protective rights and do not suggest an ability to control the partnerships 
adobe ventures carry their investments in equity securities at estimated fair market value and unrealized gains and losses are included in investment gain loss 
the stock of a number of technology investments held by the limited partnerships at november  is not publicly traded  and  therefore  there is no established market for their securities 
in order to determine the fair market value of these investments  we use the most recent round of financing involving new non strategic investors or estimates made by granite ventures based on their assessment of the current market value 
it is our policy to review the fair value of these investments held by adobe ventures on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of the investments in these companies 
this policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each companies cash position  financing needs  earnings revenue outlook  operational performance  management ownership changes  and competition 
the evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies  and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies 
if we believe that the carrying value of a company is carried at an amount in excess of fair value  it is our policy to record a reserve in addition to our equity method of accounting 
estimating the fair value of non marketable equity investments in early stage technology companies is inherently subjective and may contribute to significant volatility in our reported results of operations 
we recognize realized gains and losses upon sale or maturity of these investments using the specific identification method 
for further information on our long term investments  please refer to note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for leases of property and equipment we entered into two operating lease agreements in and the latter for a building currently under construction related to our headquarter office buildings in san jose  california 
the agreements qualify for operating lease accounting treatment under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for leases  and  as such  the buildings are not included on our balance sheet 
according to sfas no 
 a lease is classified as operating if it does not meet any of the following criteria at its inception the lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee at the end of the lease term  the lease contains a bargain purchase option  the lease term is equal to or more of the economic life of the leased property  the present value of the minimum lease payments equals or exceeds of the fair value of the leased property 
these agreements are subject to standard covenants  including liquidity  leverage  and profitability ratios that are reported to the lessors quarterly 
we believe we will be able to meet our obligations under the agreements  but if we default on our commitments and are unable to remedy the default quickly enough  the lessors may terminate all remaining commitments if any remain  and they may demand we purchase the building for an amount equal to the current lease balance  or require that we remarket or relinquish the building 
if we are required to purchase the buildings and do not elect to refinance  this will substantially decrease our cash available for working capital and require us to add the value of the buildings to our balance sheet 
if we remarket or relinquish the buildings  this could require us to find alternate facilities on terms that may not be as favorable as the current arrangement 
as of november   we were in compliance with all covenants 
for further information on these leases  please refer to note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position or its results of operations

our pro forma financial information does not include restructuring and other charges  acquired in process research and development  amortization and impairment of goodwill and purchased intangibles  gain or loss on the sale of specific assets eg building  and gains and losses on investments in equity securities 
we believe the disclosure of the pro forma financial information helps investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our ongoing operations from quarter to quarter and from year to year because it removes certain items from the financial information to more clearly reveal our ongoing operating results 
however  we urge investors to carefull y review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q and our annual reports on form k that are filed with the sec  as well as our quarterly earnings releases  and compare the gaap financial information with the pro forma financial results disclosed in our quarterly earnings releases and investor calls  as well as in some of our other reports

legal actions on september   adobe filed suit in the us district court  northern district of california the california action  against international typeface corporation itc and agfa monotype corporation amt  companies which have common ownership and management  seeking a declaration that a adobe s distribution of font software  which generates itc typefaces  did not breach its contract pursuant to which adobe licensed certain rights with respect to itc typefaces  and b adobe did not violate the digital millennium copyright act dmca with respect to  or induce or contribute to the infringement of copyrights in  itc s and amt s truetype font software 
amt had previously asserted that adobe had committed such breach of contract and violation of the dmca 
on september   adobe initiated arbitration proceedings in london  england the london arbitration against amt  seeking a declaration that adobe s distribution of font software that generates amt typefaces did not breach its contract pursuant to which it licensed certain rights with respect to amt typefaces 
amt has made a breach of contract claim in response to adobe s arbitration demand in the london arbitration  asserting that adobe wrongfully granted and or allowed third parties greater rights to distribute and embed amt fonts than adobe was licensed to grant and or allow 
if amt prevails on its breach of contract claims  amt may have the right to terminate adobe s right to distribute any of its products that then still contain font software that generates amt typefaces 
adobe asserts that it negotiated for and obtained express  written licenses from both amt and itc approximately ten years ago permitting adobe to allow end users to embed amt and itc fonts in electronic documents for print and view and disputes the other breach of contract claims 
adobe also asserts that adobe acrobat  which amt and itc correctly acknowledge has been superceded by version  neither violates the dmca nor induces or contributes to the infringement of copyrights in itc s and amt s truetype font software 
on september   amt and itc filed suit against adobe in the us district court  eastern district of illinois the illinois action against adobe  asserting only that adobe s distribution of the superceded version of adobe acrobat violated the dmca  as described above 
the illinois action seeks statutory damages of  for each copy of acrobat found to violate the dmca  a claim that adobe disputes as a matter of law and fact 
the illinois action also seeks injunctive relief with respect to acrobat  although it specifically alleges  correctly  that adobe no longer distributes acrobat on november   itc filed another suit against adobe in the united states district court for the eastern district of illinois the second illinois action  this time asserting that adobe breached its contract with itc and that itc  and not adobe  owns the copyrights in font software created by adobe which generates itc typefaces 
amt and itc made a motion to dismiss the california action  challenging jurisdiction and venue 
that motion was granted by the court on december  as such  the parties respective claims will be resolved in the other actions described above 
the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain  and amt and itc may assert other claims 
adobe cannot assure that it will be able to successfully defend itself against any of the actions described above 
amt and itc seek an unspecified aggregate dollar amount of damages 
a favorable outcome for amt or itc in these actions could have a material adverse effect on adobe s business  financial condition and operating results 
we strongly believe that all of amt s and itc s claims are without merit  and will vigorously defend against them in addition to pursuing our own claims as described above 
on september   plaintiff fred b 
dufresne filed suit against adobe  microsoft corporation  macromedia  inc  and trellix corporation in the us district court  district of massachusetts  alleging infringement of us patent no 
 entitled client server system using embedded hypertext tags for application and database development 
the plaintiff s complaint asserts that defendants have infringed  and continue to infringe one or more claims of the patent by making  using  selling and or offering for sale  inter alia  products supporting microsoft active server pages technology 
the plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory damages  preliminary and permanent injunctive relief  trebling of damages for willful infringement  and fees and costs 
adobe strongly disagrees with the plaintiff s claims and intends to vigorously defend against this action 
on november   plaintiffs shell slate software corporation and ben weiss filed a civil action in the us district court in los angeles against the company alleging false designation of origin  trade secret misappropriation  breach of contract  and other causes of action 
the claim derives from the plaintiffs belief that the healing brush technique of adobe photoshop incorporates plaintiffs trade secrets 
plaintiffs seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief  compensatory  treble  and punitive damages  and fees and costs 
we believe that the action has no merit and intend to defend vigorously against it 
from time to time adobe is involved in lawsuits  claims  investigations and proceedings  in addition to those identified above  consisting of intellectual property  commercial  employment and other matters  which arise in the ordinary course of business 
in accordance with sfas no 
 adobe makes a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
these provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations  settlements  rulings  advice of legal counsel  and other information and events pertaining to a particular case 
litigation is inherently unpredictable 
however  adobe believes that it has valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against it  as well as adequate provisions for any probable and estimable losses 
it is possible  nevertheless  that cash flows or results of operations could be affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or m ore of these contingencies 
derivatives and financial instruments item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency hedging instruments we transact business in various foreign currencies  primarily in certain european countries and japan 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to revenue from yen denominated licenses in japan and euro denominated licenses in certain european countries 
our japanese operating expenses are in yen  and our european operating expenses are primarily in euro  which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to yen and euro denominated licenses 
in addition  we hedge firmly committed transactions using forward contracts 
these contracts do subject us to risk of accounting gains and losses  however  the gains and losses on these contracts typically offset or partially offset gains and losses on the assets  liabilities  and transactions being hedged 
we also hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with forward and purchased option contracts 
our revenue hedging policy is designed to reduce the negative impact on our forecasted revenue due to foreign currency exchange rate movements 
at november   total outstanding contracts included the equivalent of million in foreign currency forward exchange contracts and purchased put option contracts with a notional value of million 
as of november   all contracts were set to expi re at various times through june the bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit related losses in the event of their nonperformance 
however  to mitigate that risk we only contract with high quality counterparties with specific minimum rating requirements 
in addition  our hedging policy establishes maximum limits for each counterparty 
economic hedging hedges of forecasted transactions we use option and forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain operational cash flow exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these foreign exchange contracts  carried at fair value  may have a duration between one to twelve months 
such cash flow exposures result from portions of our forecasted revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the japanese yen and the euro 
we enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted product licensing revenue in the normal course of business  and accordingly  they are not speculative in nature 
we record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  until the forecasted transaction occurs 
when the forecasted transaction occurs  we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue 
in the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur  or it becomes probable that it will not occur  we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to interest and other income loss on the consolidated statement of income at that time 
for the fiscal year ended november   there were no such net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur 
the critical terms of the cash flow hedging instruments are the same as the underlying forecasted transactions 
the changes in fair value of the derivatives are intended to offset changes in the expected cash flows from the forecasted transactions 
we record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in other income on the consolidated statement of income 
the time value of purchased derivative instruments is deemed to be ineffective and is recorded in other income over the life of the contract 
balance sheet hedging hedging of foreign currency assets and liabilities we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as other income loss 
these derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged 
at november   the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of days or less 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of november  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a and shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
a and increase in the value of the us dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by million and million  respectively 
conversely  a and decrease in the value of the us dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by million and million  respectively 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
as a general rule  we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where these expenses create a natural hedge against foreign currency receivables 
for example  in many countries revenue from the local currency product licenses substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures  primarily related to operating expenses  on an ongoing basis 
we regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change our hedging program 
equity investments we are exposed to equity price risk on our portfolio of marketable equity securities 
as of november   our total equity holdings in publicly traded companies were valued at million compared to million at november   a decrease of 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that the fair values of these securities could experience further adverse changes in the near term 
it is our policy to review our equity holdings on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
our policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each of the companies cash position  earnings revenue outlook  stock price performance over the past six months  liquidity and management ownership 
if we believe that an other than temporary decline exists in one of our marketable equity securities  it is our policy to write down these equity investments to the market value and record the related writedown in our consolidated stateme nts of income the following table represents the potential decrease in fair values of our marketable equity securities that are sensitive to changes in the stock market 
fair value deteriorations of   and were selected based on the probability of their occurrence 
potential decrease to the value of securities given x decrease in each stock s price fair value as of november  marketable equity securities fixed income investments at november   we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities  including those classified as cash equivalents  of million compared to million at november   an increase of 
these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of our fixed income investments 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of november  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus   or basis points over six month and twelve month time horizons 
potential decrease to the value of fixed income securities given x increase in interest rates 
month horizon month horizon we limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our fixed income portfolios 
at the present time  the maximum duration of all portfolios is limited to years 
the guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to any one security issue  limits on exposure to any one issuer  and limits on exposure to the type of instrument 
the limited duration and credit risk criteria established in our guidelines do reduce the exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk  however  dramatic changes to interest rates could result in material changes to the market value of our fixed income securities 
interest rate hedging instruments we are exposed to interest rate risk on the operating lease obligations for some of our facilities that are tied to short term interest rates libor 
as short term interest rates rise  it may negatively impact our net income 
our policy permits us to hedge this interest rate risk using swap agreements 
the swap agreements exchange variable interest rate payments for fixed interest rate payments with high quality counterparties 
our swaps are designated as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
because they hedge against changes in the amount of future cash flows 
the critical terms of the cash flow hedging instruments are the same as the underlying obligation  so the change in fair value of the swaps is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income 
if  for some reason  the terms of the hedge no longer matched the underlying obligation  a portion of the swap may become ineffective 
under sfas no 
 the change in value of the ineffective portion would be recognized in other income loss on the consolidated statement of income 
our swaps mature at various dates through the third quarter of fiscal  consistent with the expiration of the underlying obligation 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our interest rate hedges as of november  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of minus   or basis points over six month and twelve month time horizons 
potential decrease to the value of fixed income securities given x increase in interest rates 
month horizon month horizon privately held investments we have direct investments  as well as indirect investments through adobe ventures  in several privately held companies  many of which can still be considered in the start up or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky  as the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize  and we could lose a substantial part of our entire initial investment in these companies 
it is our policy to review privately held investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying amount and economic viability of these companies 
this policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each of the companies cash position  financing needs  earnings revenue outlook  operational performance  management ownership changes  and competition 
the evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies  and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies
