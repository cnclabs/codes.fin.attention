fonar s principal mri products are its stand up tm mri  fonar tm  quad tm and echo tm mri scanners 
the stand up tm mri allows patients to be scanned for the first time under weight bearing conditions 
the company has been aggressively seeking new sales and during fiscal and  respectively received orders for and stand up tm mri scanners 
the stand up tm mri is the only mri capable of producing images in the weight bearing state 
at tesla field strength  the stand up tm mri  fonar tm and quad tm magnets are among the highest field open mri scanners in the industry  offering non claustrophobic mri together with high field image quality 
fonar s open mri scanners were the first high field strength mri scanners in the industry 
fonar also offers the echo tm  a low cost open mri scanner

see description of business products  works in progress and product marketing 
hmca commenced operations in july  and generates revenues from providing comprehensive management services including development  administration  accounting and billing and collection services together with office space  medical equipment  supplies and non medical personnel to its clients 
revenues are in the form of management and leasing fees  which have been earned under contracts with mri facilities  medical practices and physical rehabilitation practices 
since april  hmca no longer engages in the management of primary care medical practices 
approximately of hmca s revenues for the fiscal years ended june   june  and june  were derived from contracts with facilities and practices owned by dr 
raymond v 
damadian  the president of fonar and hmca and principal stockholder of fonar 
the agreements with the mri facilities are for one year terms which renew automatically on an annual basis  unless terminated 
the fees are based on the number of procedures performed and currently range from to  per mri scan 
the fees are reviewed and if appropriate  adjusted on an annual basis by mutual agreement 
the agreements with the physical rehabilitation practices are for a term of years 
the fees are fixed monthly fees adjusted annually 
historically  adjustments have been on the basis of changes in hmca s costs  plus a percentage of costs 
currently  the monthly fees under these contracts with the physical rehabilitation practices range from approximately  to  prior to hmca s diversiture of a a services  inc  which managed the medical practices  the monthly fees under the contracts with the medical practices were  during fiscal critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to investments  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue and related costs of revenue from sales contracts for our mri scanner products  under the percentage of completion method 
under this method  we recognize revenue and related costs of revenue  as each sub assembly is completed 
amounts received in advance of our commencement of production are recorded as customer advances 
we recognize revenue from license agreements for our intellectual property over the shorter of the contractual life of the license or the estimated economic life 
for our current license agreement  we are recognizing revenue ratably over years 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as of june   we recorded a valuation allowance which reduced our deferred tax assets to equal our deferred tax liability 
we amortize our intangible assets  including patents  purchased management agreements and capitalized software development costs  over the shorter of the contractual legal life or the estimated economic life 
our amortization life for patents  purchased management agreements and capitalized software development costs is to years  years and years  respectively 
we periodically assesses the recoverability of long lived assets  including property and equipment  intangibles and management agreements  when there are indications of potential impairment  based on estimates of undiscounted future cash flows 
the amount of impairment is calculated by comparing anticipated discounted future cash flows with the carrying value of the related asset 
in performing this analysis  management considers such factors as current results  trends  and future prospects  in addition to other economic factors 
during the year ended june   we recorded an impairment loss of  related to the management contracts in our physician s management services segment with the primary care medical practices 
in april   we sold a a services  inc  the subsidiary which held those contracts  back to the original sellers for a purchase price of million 
in addition  the buyers released hmca from the balance of its indebtedness remaining due on the original purchase  in the amount of  as depreciated assets attributed to these contracts was  we recognized a gain of  on the transaction 
these amounts have been reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements

confirming the company s expectation of increased demand for its mri scanners  product sales to unrelated parties increased by in fiscal from million in fiscal to million in fiscal product sales to related parties increased by in fiscal from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the company believes that its principal challenges in achieving greater market penetration are primarily attributable to the better name recognition and larger sales forces of its larger competitors such as general electric  siemens  hitachi  philips and toshiba and the ability of some of its competitors to offer attractive financing terms through affiliates  such as ge capital 
nevertheless  no other competitor offers a whole body weight bearing mri scanner such as the stand up tm mri  and general electric medical systems division acts as a manufacturer s representative for the stand up tm mri

the loss on impairment of management agreements was attributable to the closure of the primary care practices managed by hmca s subsidiary  central health care services  inc because of a significant decline in overall patient volume 
the company is enthusiastic about the future of its stand up tm mri and fonar tm product line scanners which bring a new plateau of openness to diagnostic mri and are expected to bring a new frontier in surgery for performing surgical treatments using mri images to guide surgery 
the company believes its new products are beginning to successfully penetrate the market  as reflected in the dramatic increase in product sales from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal  to million in fiscal and to million in fiscal in addition to increased product sales  the decline in service and repair fees has been reversed  as reflected by the increase in service and repair fees from million in fiscal to million in fiscal to million in fiscal and million in fiscal continuing its tradition as the originator of mri  the company remained committed to maintaining its position as the leading innovator of the industry through aggressive investing in research and development

service revenues have also increased over the past four fiscal years  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal to million in fiscal and to in fiscal  which increases are attributable primarily to the increased number of scanners being placed in service
