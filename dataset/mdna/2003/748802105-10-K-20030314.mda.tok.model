net sales   increase decrease  we believe that our net sales were adversely affected by the slowdown in the us economy and specifically a reduction in post press capital spending by newspaper industry publishers 
gross profit   increase decrease  percentage of net sales the decrease in gross profit is primarily due to lower net sales 
additionally  our gross profit was affected by a higher percentage of fixed manufacturing overhead costs related to lower shipment volumes and cost overruns resulting from higher than expected production and installation costs on some larger custom orders  these cost overruns declined during the course of the costs adversely affecting gross profit were offset in part by cost cutting measures including workforce reductions  a two week plant shutdown  and four day work weeks from january to august selling  general and administrative expense   increase decrease percentage of net sales the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses reflects non recurring costs generated in  changes to our allowance for doubtful accounts  and reduction in variable expenses offset in part by the write off of impaired goodwill 
during  we recorded non recurring charges of  with respect to efforts by the special committee of our board of directors to evaluate strategic alternatives for the company and with respect to compensation charges relating to our payment to several non executive employees of an amount equal to the excess of market value over the exercise price of options surrendered by the employees 
additionally  in  we recorded a net increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts of  based on our assessment of the collectability of customer accounts and the aging of our accounts receivable 
in contrast  we reduced our allowance for doubtful accounts by  during  because we collected customer receivable balances that were previously reserved 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was also affected by workforce reductions and lower variable selling expenses 
the reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses was partially offset by the write off of goodwill 
in  we amortized our goodwill asset by approximately  in  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
our test of goodwill impairment included comparing the value of goodwill to projected discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the company s average cost of funds 
as a result of our goodwill impairment test  we wrote off approximately  of goodwill in research and development increase decrease percentage of net sales the majority of our research and development costs represented expenditures for the development of our stacker  high resolution ink jet printer for our bottomwrapper product line and  more recently  a new and not yet introduced product 
the majority of our research and development costs represented expenditures for improvements to the automatic palletizer system and development of the quipp gripp ii 
in  we focused much of our engineering and technical efforts on the custom design and production of customer orders 
costs related to these activities are charged to cost of goods sold as incurred 
other income and expense net increase decrease percentage of net sales the decrease in other income and expense net is primarily due to the decrease in interest income 
the decrease in interest income resulted from lower interest rates and lower average balances of cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale 
the decrease was offset in part by gains on the sale of securities and an increase in royalty income relating to our automatic cart loading system technology

net sales   increase decrease  we believe the decrease in sales is due to a slowdown in the us and latin american economies and specifically a reduction in capital spending by newspaper publishers 
the decline in newspaper advertising revenue has been widely reported  and we believe that the sale of our products have been affected as a result 
gross profit   increase decrease  percentage of net sales the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales is due primarily to shifts in product mix  a higher percentage of fixed manufacturing overhead costs due to lower production volumes  and higher production and installation costs for our new products 
we have incurred higher production and installation costs for two new products  the automatic palletizer and gripper conveyor system  as compared to other products that we sell 
historically  the initial production and installation of new products generate lower margins when they are introduced 
nevertheless  costs with regard to installation of the palletizer and the quipp gripp ii  our gripper conveyor  exceeded management s expectations and have had a more pronounced effect on our gross margins than management initially anticipated 
we successfully completed several gripper conveyor and palletizer installations during and anticipate that the experience we have gained will enable us to better gauge pricing and costs in connection with new orders for these products 
selling  general and administrative expense   increase decrease percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative expense expenses decreased primarily due to reduced variable expenses  including bonuses  commissions  and warranty costs 
the reduced expenses were offset in part by approximately  with respect to efforts by the special committee of our board of directors to evaluate strategic alternatives for the company and with respect to compensation charges relating to our payment to several non executive employees of an amount equal to the excess of market value over the exercise price of options surrendered by the employees

other income and expense net increase decrease percentage of net sales the decrease in other income and expense net is primarily due to the decrease in interest income 
the decrease in interest income resulted from lower average balances of cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale 
in may  we purchased  shares of common stock in a tender offer for  and also incurred  in related fees and expenses 
general most of our sales are made on a contract basis 
typically  we receive a deposit upon the execution of the sales contract 
prior to shipment  we receive additional installment payments 
we normally receive larger orders several months in advance of delivery 
therefore  backlog can be an important  though by no means conclusive  indication of our short term revenue stream 
the timing of revenues can be affected by pending orders  the amount of custom engineering required  the timetable for delivery  the completion of the installation  and the receipt and nature of new orders 
our backlog  as of december  and december   was  and  respectively 
orders booked in were  as compared to  in as a result of continued uncertainties regarding capital spending by newspaper publishers  we remain cautious as to market conditions in and believe that  even if market conditions improve  there will be no noticeable effect on quipp s financial results until late at best 
liquidity and capital resources over the past several years  we have been able to generate sufficient cash to support our operations  pay a special dividend to shareholders in totaling  and purchase  shares of our common stock in a tender offer in for an aggregate of  plus  in expenses 
although  our operating results in and were well below the levels of recent years  our cash flow was not adversely affected 
our cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale increased by  in and increased by  in  without giving effect to cash used in connection with the tender offer 
while our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities may decline in if adverse economic conditions continue  we do not anticipate that we will be required to seek external funding 
our long term debt consists solely of obligations under variable rate industrial revenue bonds that were issued through the dade county industrial development authority in at december   the balance due on the bonds was  of which  is classified as a current liability on our balance sheet 
during  the bonds bore interest at an average rate of 
on december   cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale totaled  as compared to  at december   an increase of  the increase was primarily due to cash provided by operations 
working capital at december  was  an increase of  from  at december  we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund operations at the current level 
the following table provides information relating to our material contractual obligations at december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt      critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that  among other things  affect the reported amounts of assets  revenues and expenses 
these estimates are most significant in connection with our critical accounting policies  namely those of our accounting policies that are most important to the representation of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments often result from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that our critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition involving complex installations  allowance for doubtful accounts  contract contingencies and warranty reserves 
revenue recognition involving complex installations our revenue recognition policy with regard to equipment sales involving complex installations calls for recognition when installation is complete 
because complex installations often require ongoing customer consultation even after a product is installed and is running  management often must make a judgment as to when an installation may be considered complete 
we believe that an installation generally is complete when our customers can use the equipment in their daily operations and collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
nevertheless  there is a degree of subjectivity involved in making this determination  which can affect the timing of recognition of revenues and the related cost of sales 
allowance for doubtful accounts we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically not exceeded our expectations and the provisions established  there is a risk that credit losses in the future will exceed those that have occurred in the past  in which case our operating results would be adversely affected 
on the other hand  our operating results in benefited from a  reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts because we collected customer receivable balances that were previously reserved 
contract contingencies contract contingencies involve estimates of additional expenses that may be incurred after installation is complete 
these expenses occur when additional efforts are required to assure customer satisfaction 
warranty reserves we record a warranty reserve based on our actual historical return rates and repair costs at the time of sale 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  future warranty return rates or repair costs could be in excess of our warranty reserves 
we could also be affected by competitive pressures that force us to extend the warranty period for our products 
additionally  we do not have extensive warranty claims experience with recently introduced products 
a significant increase in product return rates or a significant increase in the costs to repair our products would adversely affect our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns or additional costs materialize 
market risk we are exposed to various types of market risk  including changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
because our cash and investments exceed short and long term debt  the exposure to interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
due to the short term maturities of our investments  we believe there is no significant risk arising from interest rate fluctuations 
we are actively managing our investment portfolios to increase return on investments  but  in order to ensure safety and liquidity  will only invest in instruments with credit quality and which are traded in a secondary market 
the counterparties are major financial institutions and government agencies 
inflation the rate of inflation has not had a material impact on operations
