 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized 
instead  they will be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas at december  we had unamortized goodwill of approximately million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of approximately million  all of which were subject to the transition provisions of sfas in connection with the adoption of sfas  we evaluated our intangible assets and determined that our connecticut otb operating right and our trade name with net carrying amounts at december  of approximately million and million  respectively  have indefinite useful lives and  accordingly  we ceased amortization as of january  in addition  as required by sfas  we reclassified our employee work force intangible asset with a net carrying value of approximately million  net of related deferred tax liabilities  to goodwill effective january  the following table compares the pro forma net income loss available to common stockholders for the years ended october    and  the two months ended december   and the year ended december   adjusted to reflect the adoption of sfas as if it had occurred at the beginning of the periods presented  to the reported net income available to common stockholders for the year ended december  two months ended year ended year ended years ended october  december  pro forma pro forma pro forma pro forma pro forma as reported adjusted income available to common stockholders adjusted income loss before extraordinary item   adjusted income loss before extraordinary item available to common stockholders       adjusted net income loss available to common stockholders  adjusted earnings per share amounts basic and diluted adjusted income before extraordinary item per share available to common stockholders basic diluted adjusted net income loss per share available to common stockholders basic diluted shares used in calculating adjusted per share amounts basic       diluted       reconciliation of reported net income to adjusted net income reported net income loss available to common stockholders  add back amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  net of tax benefit      adjusted net income loss available to common stockholders  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background we are a leading worldwide provider of services  systems and products to both the instant ticket lottery industry and pari mutuel wagering industry based on revenues 
we believe we offer our customers the widest array of some of the most technologically advanced products and services in each of these industries 
we also believe that we are the world s only fully integrated lottery service provider  offering lottery authorities on line lottery systems  instant tickets and cooperative services programs 
on september   our predecessor company  autotote corporation  completed the acquisition of scientific games holding corporation sghc 
the operating results of sghc s businesses have been included in the consolidated statements of operations from the date of the acquisition 
on june   we completed the acquisition of of the equity of serigrafica chilena sa serchi 
subsequent to the acquisition  we changed the name of serchi to scientific games latino america sa the purchase price was approximately million in cash and up to million in cash or stock payable to serchi stockholders upon the achievement of certain financial performance levels of serchi over the next four years 
the acquisition was recorded using the purchase method of accounting and the acquired assets and liabilities have been recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the operating results of the serchi business have been included in the consolidated statements of operations since the date of acquisition 
our revenues are derived from two principal sources service revenues and sales revenues 
service revenues are generally earned pursuant to multi year contracts to provide instant ticket and related services and on line and pari mutuel wagering systems and services  or are derived from wagering by customers at facilities we own or lease 
we believe our service revenues are recurring in nature 
sales revenues are derived from sales of prepaid phone cards and from the sale of wagering systems  equipment  and software licenses 
we operate primarily in four business segments lottery group  pari mutuel group  venue management group and telecommunications products group 
our lottery group derives revenues from the sale of instant lottery tickets and related services and the sale or operation of on line lottery systems 
in  our lottery group accounted for approximately of all retail sales of instant lottery tickets in the united states 
in the instant ticket business  we typically sell our tickets for a per unit price or are paid a fee equal to a percentage of the retail value of the instant tickets sold by a state lottery 
in the on line lottery market in the united states  we are generally paid a fee equal to a percentage of all dollars wagered on lottery tickets  in international markets  we generally sell our lottery systems to the lottery operators 
on line lottery refers to a computerized system in which lottery terminals in retail outlets are continuously connected to a central computer system for the sale and validation of lottery tickets and related functions 
our lottery group provides instant tickets and related services and lottery systems 
instant ticket and related services includes ticket design and manufacturing as well as value added services  including game design  sales and marketing support  inventory management and warehousing and fulfillment services 
in addition  this division includes promotional instant tickets and pull tab tickets that we sell to both lottery and non lottery customers 
our lottery systems business is comprised of autotote s historical lottery operations segment as well as sghc s systems business  both of which include the supply of transaction processing software for the accounting and validation of both instant ticket and on line lottery games  point of sale terminal hardware sales  central site computers and communication hardware sales  and ongoing support and maintenance services for these products 
this business line also includes software  hardware and support service for sports betting and credit card processing systems 
we currently operate on line lottery systems for seven of the on line lottery authorities in the united states  and we believe we are the second largest on line lottery provider in europe 
our pari mutuel group is a leading worldwide provider of wagering systems to the pari mutuel wagering industry  to which we also provide related race broadcasting and telecommunications services 
our pari mutuel group is comprised of our north american and international on track  off track and inter track pari mutuel services  simulcasting and communications services  and video gaming  as well as sales of pari mutuel systems and equipment 
we provide our systems and services to thoroughbred  harness and greyhound racetracks  otbs  casinos  jai alai frontons and other establishments where pari mutuel wagering is permitted 
we are generally paid a percentage of all racing industry wagers  or handle  processed by our wagering systems  and we receive a service fee for our satellite communications services on a per event or a monthly subscription basis 
in  our systems processed approximately of the estimated billion in pari mutuel wagering conducted on horse racing in north america 
our venue management group includes our connecticut otb operations and our dutch on track and off track betting operations 
our telecommunications products group is comprised of our prepaid cellular phone card business 
the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year traditionally comprise the weakest seasons for our pari mutuel wagering businesses 
as a result of inclement weather during the winter months  a number of racetracks do not operate and those that do operate often experience missed racing days 
this adversely affects the amounts wagered and our corresponding service revenues 
wagering equipment sales and software license revenues usually reflect a limited number of large transactions  which do not recur on an annual basis 
consequently  revenues and operating results can vary substantially from period to period as a result of the timing of revenue recognition for major equipment sales and software license revenue 
in addition  instant ticket and prepaid phone card sales may vary depending on the season and timing of contract awards  changes in customer budgets  ticket inventory levels  lottery retail sales and general economic conditions 
operating results may also vary significantly from period to period depending on the addition or disposition of business units in each period 
the acquisition of sghc in and  to a lesser extent  the acquisition of of the equity of serchi in  both of which were accounted for as purchases  affect the comparability of operations from period to period see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the acquisition of sghc  we changed our fiscal year end from an october year end to a calendar year end  beginning with the year ended december  effective april   we changed our corporate name from autotote corporation to scientific games corporation 
on january   we transferred the listing for our class a common stock to the nasdaq national market  and our trading symbol was changed to sgms 
critical accounting policies the sec recently issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting an available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
we have identified the following as accounting policies critical to us revenue recognition  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  income taxes and management estimates 
revenue recognition almost all of our revenues  except revenues earned from the sale of wagering systems  are earned pursuant to contractual terms and conditions either as a percentage of the amount wagered or when products are shipped to the customer and the customer assumes ownership of the product 
such revenues do not involve difficult  subjective or complex judgements 
revenues from fixed price contracts to provide wagering systems including equipment and software licenses are recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs to complete with revisions to estimated costs reflected in the period in which changes become known 
anticipated losses on fixed price contracts are recognized when the losses can be estimated 
recognition of revenue under the percentage of completion method requires us to make estimates regarding the resources required or the scope of work to be performed 
if we do not accurately estimate the extent of work to be performed  manage our projects properly or complete our contracts within the specified time period  we may experience changes in revenues and resulting reductions in margins or losses on our contracts in subsequent periods 
at the time we enter into service or sales contracts  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed and determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of our fee is due beyond our normal payment terms which may vary depending on the nature of the contract and location of the customer  we account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable and recognize the revenue when payments become due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
for our international customers  we frequently require collateral in the form of a letter of credit for all or a portion of our fee 
if we determine collection is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize the revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the recoverability of long lived assets and intangible assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected historical performance or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant adverse change in the legality of our business ventures or the business climate in which we operate  and loss of a significant customer 
when we determine that the carrying value of the long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on the projected discounted cash flow  using a discount rate equal to a risk free rate of return  or by a comparison to third party indications of fair market value 
at december   the net carrying value of our long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill amounted to approximately million 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we ceased amortizing goodwill and intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives as of january  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas  and sfas require that we evaluate our existing goodwill and intangible assets and make any necessary reclassifications to conform with the new criteria outlined in sfas and sfas we completed our assessment of goodwill and intangible assets in the second quarter of  and we made all necessary reclassifications to goodwill in accordance with the provisions of sfas no material adjustments were made to the goodwill and intangible assets balances at december  we also evaluated the remaining useful lives of the intangible assets that will continue to be amortized and have determined that no revision to those useful lives is necessary 
we are required to test goodwill and our intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually 
we intend to perform this annual impairment test after the completion of our annual financial operating plan which occurs in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
we completed our annual impairment test for fiscal with no adjustment required to the carrying value of our goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives as of december  income taxes income taxes are calculated using the asset and liability method under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
under this method  deferred income taxes are calculated by applying enacted statutory tax rates to cumulative temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
under sfas  the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we have a history of losses  which have generated sizable net operating loss carryforwards for both state and federal tax purposes 
prior to  we did not recognize any income tax benefits from these losses because we were not able to demonstrate that it was more likely than not that we would generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize some or all of these losses  and  accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance offsetting our deferred tax asset associated with these losses 
because of improved financial results in and anticipated taxable income in and beyond  we now believe that it is more likely than not that we will utilize our tax losses to offset future taxable income 
as a result  we recorded a deferred tax asset in the fourth quarter of of approximately million by eliminating the corresponding deferred income tax valuation allowance  and recognized an income tax benefit in income from continuing operations of approximately million and an income tax benefit as an offset against the extraordinary charges of approximately million 
should our expectations for future levels of taxable income not materialize or occur in amounts significantly less than what we have forecasted  some or all of our deferred tax assets may not be recoverable 
a significant change in our expectations for future taxable income could have a material affect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
management estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
some of the more significant estimates made by management involve percentage of completion for contracted lottery and pari mutuel wagering systems  as discussed above  evaluation of the recoverability of assets including accounts receivable  inventories and long lived assets and the assessment of litigation and contingencies  including income taxes 
management specifically evaluates the recoverability of accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  past collection experiences with specific customers  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
we do not require our customers to provide collateral for services provided pursuant to our service contracts 
for sales of equipment and wagering systems to international customers we generally require that no less than a significant portion of the amounts to be paid be collateralized by irrevocable letters of credit 
changes in the underlying financial condition of our customers could result in a material impact to our results of operation and financial position 
our inventory consists principally of parts and finished goods to which we provide a reserve for obsolete and slow moving items 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of our reserves by reviewing historical rates of scrap  on hand quantities as compared to historical and projected usage levels  orders for new equipment  and contractual requirements to service our installed base of equipment 
we record a liability pertaining to pending litigation based on our best estimate of a potential loss  if any  or at the minimum end of the range of loss in circumstances where the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
because of uncertainties surrounding the nature of litigation and the ultimate liability to us  if any  we continually revise our estimated losses as additional facts become known 
related party transactions statement of financial accounting standards no 
 related party disclosures  requires us to identify and describe material transactions involving related persons or entities and to disclose information necessary to understand the effects of such transactions on our consolidated financial statements 
we historically have not been a party to material transactions involving related persons or entities 
we are currently part of a consortium which includes lottomatica spa  our largest equity investor  that has been awarded a contract to be the exclusive operator for instant tickets in italy 
this award has been protested and is being reviewed in the italian courts 
if the award is ratified  we expect to enter into a contract  which initially would provide for the printing of tickets and the installation of a new centralized system  along with a full complement of cooperative services 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following analysis compares our results of operations for the year ended december  to the results for the year ended december  year ended december  lottery group pari mutuel group venue management group telecom munications group totals in thousands service revenues     sales revenues     total revenues      cost of service     cost of sales     amortization of service contract software   total operating expense      gross profit      selling  general and administrative     depreciation and amortization      segment operating income      unallocated corporate selling  general and administrative costs consolidated operating income  interest expense  year ended december  lottery group pari mutuel group venue management group telecom munications group totals in thousands service revenues     sales revenues     total revenues      cost of service     cost of sales     amortization of service contract software   total operating expenses      gross profit      selling  general and administrative     depreciation and amortization      segment operating income      unallocated corporate selling  general and administrative costs consolidated operating income  interest expense  revenue analysis for the year ended december   revenues of million improved million or overall as compared to the prior year  reflecting an million or increase in service revenue and a million or decrease in sales revenue 
the increase in service revenues in is primarily attributable to a million or increase in revenues in the lottery group  of which approximately million is attributable to a full year of operation of the maine and iowa lotteries which started in mid  approximately million is attributable to the startup of the south carolina educational lottery in january  approximately million is attributable to continued growth in the instant ticket sales  and approximately million is attributable to the acquisition of serchi in june these gains were partially offset by the absence of the french lottery business that was sold in the third quarter of cooperative service revenues were down slightly for the year as increased revenues at all of our other customers helped offset the loss of approximately million of revenues from the loss of the new york contract  which was awarded to another vendor prior to our acquisition of sghc 
pari mutuel group service revenues increased million or  primarily reflecting the additional revenue from the churchill downs simulcasting contract in and increased service fees 
venue management group service revenues increased million or  of which million is attributable to the opening of the hartford raceview center in  plus continued growth in telephone account wagering  partially offset by a full year reduction in the new york racing association take out rate 
the balance of the increase is attributable to our dutch operation  primarily due to higher handle and a favorable exchange rate 
the million decrease in sales revenues in is primarily attributable to a million decrease in sales revenue in the pari mutuel group reflecting the completion in of a systems and equipment contract to the turkey jockey club 
this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in systems and equipment sales revenue in the lottery group and a million or increase in prepaid phone card sales in the telecommunications group reflecting the benefit from a increase in volume  partially offset by product unit price decreases 
gross profit analysis gross profit increased million or in reflecting an improvement of million on service revenues  partially offset by a decrease of million on lower sales revenues 
the increase in service revenues discussed above contributed approximately million to this gross margin improvement  with cost control measures contributing an additional benefit of approximately million  including benefits of approximately million in the pari mutuel group and million in the venue management group 
in addition  cost control measures amounting to approximately million  in addition to increased volume  nearly offset the effect of selling price reductions in the prepaid phone card business 
expense analysis selling  general and administrative expenses of million in the year ended december  were million higher than in the same period in  primarily due to million of investigation and other costs attributable to the pick six matter see business security  the reversal in the prior year period of a million litigation reserve when a lawsuit was settled  coupled with higher proposal costs  professional services and compensation 
depreciation and amortization expense  including amortization of service contract software  of million in the year ended december  decreased million from million in the same period in depreciation expense increased million in the year ended december  from the same period in  primarily as a result of higher depreciation on new computer systems and terminals acquired in connection with the start up of the new on line lotteries 
amortization expense was million lower in the year ended december  than in the same period in  primarily as a result of the adoption of sfas and sfas effective january  interest expense of million in the year ended december  decreased million from million in the same period in  primarily due to lower average debt levels following the third quarter repurchase of million of our senior subordinated notes  plus the effect of lower average interest rates on our outstanding term loans 
in addition  interest expense in the year ended december  included approximately million of termination charges relating to the refinancing of our senior secured credit facility the facility in december these charges resulted from the early cancellation of three interest rate swap agreements that we were required to maintain pursuant to the terms of the prior credit facility 
see liquidity  capital resources and working capital for a discussion of the offering  the repurchase of our senior subordinated notes and the replacement of the facility with a new senior secured credit facility 
other expense other expense of million in consists primarily of foreign currency losses 
extraordinary item in  we repaid approximately million of our outstanding senior subordinated notes and refinanced the facility 
as a result  we recorded extraordinary charges aggregating approximately million related to the redemption premium paid in the amount of approximately million on the redeemed notes  the million fee paid to the term loan lenders to permit us to use the majority of the net proceeds from our equity offering to redeem the notes  and the write off of approximately million of previously deferred financing costs 
these extraordinary charges were partially offset by federal and state income tax benefits of approximately million attributable to these expenses 
the resultant total of approximately million was reflected as an extraordinary expense in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
income tax expense we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately million in the year ended december   of which approximately million was reflected as an offset against the extraordinary charges discussed above 
we have a history of losses  which have generated sizable net operating loss carryforwards for both state and federal tax purposes 
prior to  we did not recognize any income tax benefits from these losses because we were not able to demonstrate that it was more likely than not that we would generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize some or all of these losses  and  accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance offsetting our deferred tax asset associated with these losses 
in  we recognized operating loss carryforwards in the amount of million plus the reversal of million of deferred tax liabilities provided in connection with the acquisition of sghc 
because of improved financial results in and anticipated taxable income in and beyond  we now believe that it is more likely than not that we will utilize our tax losses to offset future taxable income considering any limitations on the use of our tax losses imposed by the internal revenue code of as a result  we recorded a deferred tax asset in the fourth quarter of of approximately million by eliminating the corresponding deferred income tax valuation allowance  and recognized an income tax benefit in income from continuing operations of approximately million and an income tax benefit as an offset against the extraordinary charges of approximately million 
as a result of our recognition of the income tax benefit of the net operating loss carryforward in  the financial statement income tax provision is expected to increase from approximately in to approximately in  however  we anticipate that our cash tax rate in will be approximately as a result of utilizing some of our tax losses to offset taxes that would otherwise be payable 
in the year ended december   we recorded an income tax expense of million 
federal  state and foreign taxes were mostly offset by the usage of existing net operating loss carryforwards in the amount of million plus the reversal of deferred tax liabilities provided in connection with the acquisition of sghc 
no current tax benefit was recognized in the year ended december  on the then remaining value of the domestic net operating loss carryforwards 
year ended december  compared to pro forma year ended december  on september   we completed the acquisition of sghc 
the operating results of sghc s businesses have been included in the consolidated statements of operations from the date of the acquisition 
because the acquisition of sghc had such a significant effect on our business and because we also changed our year end reporting date  we do not believe that a comparison of the actual results for the year ended december  to the actual results for the year ended october  is meaningful 
therefore  the following analysis compares our results of operations for to the pro forma results for the year ended december   as if sghc had been acquired at the beginning of year ended december  lottery group pari mutuel group venue management group telecom munications group totals in thousands service revenues     sales revenues     total revenues      cost of service     cost of sales     amortization of service contract software   total operating expenses      gross profit      selling  general and administrative     depreciation and amortization      segment operating income      unallocated corporate selling  general and administrative costs consolidated operating income  interest expense  pro forma year ended december  unaudited lottery group pari mutuel group venue management group telecom munications group totals in thousands service revenues     sales revenues     total revenues      cost of service     cost of sales     amortization of service contract software   total operating expenses      gross profit      selling  general and administrative     depreciation and amortization      segment operating income      unallocated corporate selling  general and administrative costs consolidated operating income  interest expense  revenue analysis for the year ended december   revenues of million improved million or overall as compared to the pro forma prior year  reflecting a million or increase in service revenues which was partially offset by a million or decrease in sales revenues 
the increase in service revenues in is primarily attributable to a million or increase in revenues in the lottery group of which million is attributable to a full year operation for the vermont and new hampshire lotteries  million is attributable to the start up of the iowa and maine lotteries in july  million is attributable to continued solid growth in instant ticket sales and million is attributable to increased cooperative service revenues 
pari mutuel group service revenues of million were flat compared to the pro forma prior year with increases in the north american market of million being offset by million related to lower handle in the european markets and million caused by the strengthening of the dollar 
the million decline in venue management group revenues to million in as compared to pro forma is attributable to a million decline due to the strengthening of the dollar  a million decline due to lower revenues in connecticut because of the reduced take out rate implemented by the new york racing association in july  and a million decline due to the loss of handle immediately following the september  attack 
the million decrease in sales revenues to million in as compared to pro forma is primarily attributable to the completion in of the extrema terminal sales contract with sisal sport italia spa  which accounted for million of sales revenues in this decrease was partially offset by million of new lottery related equipment sales in  million of pari mutuel equipment sales to foreign customers  plus a million or increase in prepaid phone card sales reflecting the benefit from a volume growth rate  partially offset by product price decreases 
gross profit analysis gross profit of million in the year ended december  increased million or from the pro forma prior year 
the lottery group revenue improvements discussed above contributed million to gross profits and cost control measures contributed approximately million 
cost control measures saving million in the pari mutuel group and million in the venue management group  which included the restructuring of the operations in germany and the netherlands  also contributed to the overall improvement in margins 
in addition  cost control measures amounting to million and volume increases of million helped to reduce the million effect of selling price reductions in the prepaid phone card business 
gross profit as a percentage of service revenues increased to in the year ended december   compared to in the pro forma prior year 
this gross profit increase results primarily from revenue improvements and cost control measures across all segments of our service businesses  as discussed above 
gross profit as a percentage of sales revenues was in the year ended december   the same as in the pro forma prior year  reflecting a comparable mix of systems and equipment sold in the periods 
expense analysis selling  general and administrative expenses  including software development costs  of million in the year ended december  were million or lower than in the pro forma prior year primarily as a result of million in cost reduction programs and merger related synergies 
depreciation and amortization expense  including amortization of service contract software  of million in the year ended december  increased million or from million in the pro forma prior year as a result of million of depreciation on new computer systems and terminals for the expanded domestic lottery business  million of depreciation on the year expansion of the alpharetta  georgia printing facility and the new leeds  united kingdom printing facility  partially offset by a million reduction for pari mutuel assets that became fully depreciated 
interest expense of million in the year ended december  decreased million from million in the pro forma prior year due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt and lower average debt outstanding during the year other expense of million in the year ended december  consisted primarily of currency translation expense  and other income of million in the pro forma year ended december  consisted primarily of interest on invested excess cash 
income tax expense we recorded an income tax expense of million in the year ended december  federal  state and foreign taxes in the year were mostly offset by the usage of existing net operating loss carryforwards in the amount of million plus the reversal of million of deferred tax liabilities provided in connection with the acquisition of sghc 
no current tax benefit has been recognized on the remaining value of the domestic net operating loss carryforwards in the period 
liquidity  capital resources and working capital in order to finance the acquisition of sghc in and refinance substantially all of our then existing indebtedness  we conducted a series of financings in september  which significantly changed our capital structure and significantly increased our leverage 
in  we initiated a debt reduction program 
in july  we completed the public offering and sale of million shares of our class a common stock at a price of per share the offering  and used the net proceeds of approximately million prior to deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses  to redeem approximately million of our senior subordinated notes 
as a result of these transactions  our capital structure improved  and standard poors ratings group and moody s investors service  inc upgraded our credit ratings 
in december  we replaced our existing senior secured credit facility the facility  with a new senior secured credit facility the facility  consisting of a million revolving credit facility due that can be increased to million  and a million term b loan due as a result of the debt reduction program  we expect interest expense in to total approximately million  assuming debt levels and interest rates remain constant 
our financing arrangements impose certain limitations on our and our subsidiaries operations

although we were in compliance with our loan covenants at december  and expect to continue to remain in compliance over the next months  no assurances can be provided that we will be able to do so or that we will be able to continue to meet the covenant requirements beyond months 
the facility provides for borrowings up to million to be used for working capital and general corporate purpose loans and for letters of credit 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit of million  but no outstanding borrowings under the facility  leaving us with a total availability of million as compared to million at december  our ability to continue to borrow under the facility will depend on remaining in compliance with the limitations imposed by our lenders  including maintenance of specified financial covenants 
presently  we have not sought and  therefore  do not have any other financing commitments 
our contractual obligations and commercial commitments principally include obligations associated with our outstanding indebtedness and future minimum operating lease obligations as set forth in the table below 
cash payments due by period total within year years years after years in thousands contractual obligations long term debt  notes and facility    other long term debt  operating leases      total contractual cash obligations     our series a convertible preferred stock requires dividend payments at a rate of per annum 
to date  we have satisfied the dividend requirement using additional shares of preferred stock 
the terms of the convertible preferred stock provide us with the flexibility to satisfy the dividend in cash commencing on september   subject to bank approval 
we expect that we will continue to make such payments in kind  accordingly  this obligation has not been reflected in the table above 
our pari mutuel wagering and on line lottery systems service contracts require us to  among other things  maintain the central computing system and related hardware in efficient working order  provide added software functionality upon request  provide on site computer operators  and furnish necessary supplies 
our primary expenditures associated with these services are personnel and related costs  which are expensed as incurred and are included in operating expenses services in the consolidated statements of operations 
historically  the revenues we derive from our service contracts have exceeded the direct costs associated with fulfilling our obligations under these pari mutuel wagering and lottery systems service contracts 
we expect that we will continue to realize positive cash flow and operating income as we extend or renew existing service contracts 
we also expect that we will enter into new contracts that are accretive to our cash flow 
in addition  through advancements in technology  we are continually deploying more efficient and cost effective methods for manufacturing and delivering our products and services to our customers 
we expect that technological efficiencies will continue to positively impact our future cash flows and operating results 
we are not party to any other material short term or long term obligations or commitments pursuant to these service contracts 
periodically  we bid on new pari mutuel and on line lottery contracts 
once awarded  these contracts generally require significant up front capital expenditures for terminal assembly  customization of software  software and equipment installation and telecommunications configuration 
historically we have funded these up front costs through cash flows generated from operations  available cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facilities 
our ability to continue to procure new contracts will depend on  among other things  our then present liquidity levels and or our ability to obtain additional financing at commercially acceptable rates to finance the initial up front costs 
once operational  long term service contracts have been accretive to our operating cash flow 
for fiscal  we anticipate that capital expenditures and software expenditures will be approximately million 
however  the actual level of expenditures will ultimately depend on the extent to which we are successful in winning new contracts 
the amount of capital expenditures in fiscal and beyond will largely depend on the extent to which we are successful in winning new contracts 
furthermore  our pari mutuel wagering network consists of approximately  wagering terminals 
periodically  we elect to upgrade the technological capabilities of older terminals and replace terminals that have exhausted their useful lives 
we presently have no commitments to replace our existing terminal base and our obligation to upgrade the terminals is discretionary 
servicing our installed terminal base requires that we maintain a supply of parts and accessories on hand 
we are also required  contractually in some cases  to provide spare parts over an extended period of time  principally in connection with our systems and terminal sale transactions 
to meet our contractual obligations and maintain sufficient levels of on hand inventory quantities to service our installed base  we purchase inventory on an as needed basis 
we presently have no inventory purchase obligations 
in connection with our debt reduction program  we received approximately million from the offering after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses  and we used the net proceeds to redeem approximately million of our senior subordinated notes 
in connection with this redemption  we were required to pay the noteholders a premium of approximately million and bank amendment fees of approximately million 
we also replaced our facility with a new facility 
of the million in proceeds from the new facility  million was used to repay long term debt  million was used to pay accrued interest  million was used to pay related fees  and million was used to pay amounts due on interest rate swap agreements 
at december   our available cash and borrowing capacity totaled million compared to million at december  our available cash and borrowing capacities fluctuate principally based on the timing of collections from our customers  cash expenditures associated with new and existing pari mutuel wagering and lottery systems contracts  repayment of our outstanding debt and changes in our working capital position 
the increase in our available cash and borrowing capacity from the december  level principally reflects the impact of the december senior secured debt refinancing  and the use of cash on hand to fund our wagering systems and other capital expenditures 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  of this amount  million was provided by operations and million was used for changes in working capital 
the working capital changes occurred principally from decreases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities  and primarily accrued interest as a result of the december senior secured debt refinancing 
for the year ended december   we spent million for wagering systems and capital expenditures  million in software and million for a majority ownership in serchi 
these cash expenditures were funded primarily with net cash provided by operating activities and cash on hand 
in addition  we capitalized million of fees related to the facility 
a portion of our cash flows from operations must be used to pay our interest expense and repay our indebtedness  which will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available to us for our operations and capital expenditures 
interest expense on our outstanding debt was approximately million for the year ended december  including approximately million of non cash charges 
as a result of the debt reduction program  we expect interest expense in to total approximately million  assuming debt levels and interest rates remain constant 
approximately  of our debt is in variable rate instruments 
consequently  we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
the effect of a change in the interest rates associated with our unhedged variable rate debt will result in a change of approximately  per year in our interest expense assuming no change in our outstanding borrowings 
in  prior to the refinancing of our facility  we entered into three interest rate swap contracts for an aggregate notional amount of million in response to the requirements of our facility 
these interest rate swaps obligated us to pay a fixed libor rate and entitle us to receive a variable libor rate on an aggregate million notional amount of debt thereby creating the equivalent of fixed rate debt until may  we structured these interest rate swap agreements to qualify for hedge accounting pursuant to the provisions of sfas changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments that effectively offset the variability of cash flows associated with variable rate credit facility obligations are reported as a component of stockholders equity 
these amounts are subsequently reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment of the hedged credit facility obligation in the same period in which the related interest affects operations 
these swap contracts were terminated when we refinanced the facility  and accordingly  approximately million of cost was charged to interest expense in we believe that our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs  including anticipated capital expenditures  for the foreseeable future  however  we cannot assure you that this will be the case 
while we are not aware of any particular trends  our lottery contracts periodically renew and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in sustaining our cash flow from operations through renewal of our existing contracts or through the addition of new contracts 
in addition  lottery customers in the united states generally require service providers to provide performance bonds in connection with each state contract 
our ability to obtain performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms is subject to prevailing market conditions  which may be impacted by economic and political events 
although we have not experienced any difficulty obtaining such bonds  we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to obtain performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
while we are not aware of any reason to do so  if we need to refinance all or part of our indebtedness  including our senior subordinated notes  on or before maturity  or provide letters of credit or cash in lieu of performance bonds  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain new financing or to refinance any of our indebtedness  including our revolving credit facility and our senior subordinated notes  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
it applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessees 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies  and it applies to all entities 
we are required to adopt sfas  effective for calendar year we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our future consolidated operations or financial position  as we are now constituted 
in april  the fasb issued statement no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas 
sfas updates  clarifies and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements 
sfas rescinds statement  which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect 
as a result  the criteria in opinion will now be used to classify those gains and losses because statement has been rescinded 
statement was issued to establish accounting requirements for the effects of transition to the provisions of the motor carrier act of because the transition has been completed  statement is no longer necessary 
sfas amends statement to require that certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
this amendment is consistent with the fasb s goal of requiring similar accounting treatment for transactions that have similar economic effects 
sfas also makes technical corrections to existing pronouncements 
while those corrections are not substantive in nature  in some instances  they may change accounting practice 
we are required to adopt sfas  effective january  we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated operations and financial position  however it will be necessary in future years reports for us to reclassify the extraordinary losses to other income deductions  pursuant to sfas in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas will spread out the reporting of expenses related to restructurings initiated after because a commitment to a plan to exit an activity or dispose of long lived assets will no longer be enough to record a liability for the anticipated costs 
instead  companies will record exit and disposal costs when they are incurred and can be measured at fair value  and they will subsequently adjust the recorded liability for changes in estimated cash flows 
we are required to adopt sfas  prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our future consolidated operations or financial position  as we are now constituted 
recent developments on february   the new mexico lottery authority board of directors approved us as the choice for the lottery authority s instant ticket and related services contract 
we anticipate that the contract will generate approximately million of revenue over its four year term 
on january   we completed the acquisition of mdi entertainment  inc mdi through i a tender offer at per share  in cash  ii the purchase of shares from mdi s president and chief executive officer pursuant to a separate stock purchase agreement and iii a merger agreement  whereby the remaining eight percent of mdi common shares were converted into the right to receive per share  in cash 
the acquisition will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
had the operating results of mdi been included as if the transaction had been consummated on january   our pro forma operating results for the year ended december  would not have been materially different from our actual reported results 
on january   we announced that we were awarded the contract to provide pari mutuel services to stwk  the poland racing organization 
we anticipate that the contract will generate approximately million of revenue over the its ten year term  plus up to an additional million of revenue relating to a significant expansion of the racing organization s otb network and simulcasting systems 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our products and services are sold to a diverse group of customers throughout the world 
as such  we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as a result of changes in general economic conditions  sources of supply  competition  foreign exchange rates  tax reform  litigation and regulatory developments 
the diversity and breadth of our products and geographic operations mitigate the risk that adverse changes from any single event would materially affect our financial position 
additionally  as a result of the diversity of our customer base  we do not consider ourselves exposed to concentration of credit risks 
these risks are further minimized by setting credit limits  ongoing monitoring of customer account balances  and assessment of the customers financial strengths 
inflation has not had an abnormal or unanticipated effect on our operations 
inflationary pressures would be significant to our business if raw materials used for instant lottery ticket production  prepaid phone card production or terminal manufacturing are significantly affected 
available supply from the paper and electronics industries tends to fluctuate and prices may be affected by supply 
for fiscal  inflation was not a significant factor in our results of operations  and we were not impacted by significant pricing changes in our costs  except for personnel related expenditures 
we are unable to forecast the prices or supply of substrate  component parts or other raw materials in  but we currently do not anticipate any substantial changes that will materially affect our operating results 
in certain limited cases  our lottery contracts with our customers contain provisions to adjust for inflation on an annual basis  but we cannot be assured that this adjustment would cover raw material price increases or other costs of services 
while we have long term and generally satisfactory relationships with most of our suppliers  we also believe alternative sources to meet our raw material and production needs are available 
in the normal course of business  we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and equity market risks as we seek debt and equity capital to sustain our operations 
at december  approximately one fifth of our debt was in fixed rate instruments 
we consider the fair value of all financial instruments to be not materially different from their carrying value at year end 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
in the third quarter of we completed the offering and used approximately million of the net proceeds to redeem a portion of our senior subordinated notes 
in the fourth quarter of we replaced our senior secured credit facility with a new facility consisting of a revolving credit facility due that is initially million and can be increased to million and a million term b loan due see liquidity  capital resources and working capital

these instruments  which have a notional value of million canadian dollars at december   have been designated as cash flow hedges 
for the year ended december   we recorded a credit to other comprehensive income loss of million for the change in the fair value of these foreign exchange instruments 
the following table provides notional amounts and interest rate information about our canadian currency hedge derivative financial instruments 
we do not hold any market risk instruments for trading purposes 
notional amount by expected maturity canadian currency hedge december  dollars in thousands there after total fair value canadian currency hedge notional us amount    exchange rate we are also exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
assets and liabilities outside the united states are primarily located in the united kingdom  germany  netherlands  france and austria 
our investment in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar are generally considered long term investments 
accordingly  we do not hedge these net investments 
translation gains and losses historically have not been material 
we manage our foreign currency exchange risks on a global basis by one or more of the following i securing payment from our customers in us dollars  when possible  ii utilizing borrowings denominated in foreign currency  and iii entering into foreign currency exchange contracts 
in addition  a significant portion of the cost attributable to our foreign operations is incurred in the local currencies 
we believe that a adverse change in currency exchange rates would not have a significant adverse effect on our net earnings or cash flows 
we may  from time to time  enter into foreign currency exchange or other contracts to hedge the risk associated with certain firm sales commitments  anticipated revenue streams and certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
our cash and cash equivalents and investments are in high quality securities placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings 
this investment policy limits our exposure to concentration of credit risks
