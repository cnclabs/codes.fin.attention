item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
actual results may differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and forward looking statements in this report 
overview we develop  market and support a broad family of integrated network security solutions 
our security appliance solutions include key security technology such as firewalls and virtual private networking vpn 
our appliances are built upon a highly secure operating system and proprietary software designed to identify network and application attacks and prevent them from reaching mission critical resources 
our firewall combines stateful packet inspection and application proxy technologies to deliver the highest level of security and performance for an enterprise s network 
we believe that our ability to inspect each packet of network traffic at the application layer provides our customers some of the highest levels of protection 
our target customers are large enterprises  including global companies  major financial institutions and government entities worldwide 
our appliances are sold to end users directly and indirectly by a direct sales force and resellers in the united states and in over foreign countries 
we were incorporated in in connection with a spin off from harris corporation 
at that time  we produced computers for the real time computing market as well as our firewall for the secure computing market 
we changed our name from harris computer systems corporation in june following the sale of our real time computer business 
acquisitions on january   we acquired certain assets of netoctave  inc netoctave  inc is a manufacturer of security processors and accelerator boards and cards for the secure socket layer ssl and internet protocol security ipsec markets 
as a result of the acquisition  we gained new technology  engineering talent and a customer base for the ssl and ipsec markets 
the results of netoctave  inc s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since january  the purchase consideration was approximately million 
the consideration consisted of a cash of  b a payment of up to  based upon a percentage of certain revenues recognized during the next twelve months  payable quarterly  and c  shares of our common stock valued at  based upon the market value of the shares at the time of issuance 
netoctave  inc was granted certain registration rights for the common stock it received in the transaction 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain of our consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended june  restated in percentages revenues products services total revenues cost of revenues products services total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative class action settlement total operating expenses operating loss other income expense interest income expense  net gain loss on sale of assets other income expense total other income expense loss before income tax and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income tax benefit net income loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income loss fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  total revenues 
total revenues  which consist of product sales and software maintenance and professional services revenues  increased from million for fiscal year to million in fiscal year  or 
the increase in total revenues was driven by increased demands for our products due to an increased focus on security by government and commercial enterprises and increased awareness of our product brand 
we categorize our revenues into three geographic regions north america  emea  and apac 
revenues in north america  emea and apac as a percentage of total revenues were approximately  and  respectively  in fiscal year and  and  respectively  in fiscal year all regions experienced increased sales in fiscal year compared to fiscal year our total international revenues  which are revenues for customers outside north america  represented approximately of the total revenues in fiscal year and of total revenues in fiscal year no single customer or reseller accounted for more than of our total revenue in fiscal year during  one customer represented of consolidated revenues 
this customer represented of consolidated revenues in product revenues 
product revenues consist primarily of firewall and vpn security appliances 
product revenues increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  or 
the increase in product revenues is primarily the result of increased brand awareness  channel growth and penetrating into new markets 
the majority of our product revenues for fiscal year were generated from large enterprise customers and government entities  in both domestic and international markets 
our federal division consists of a team of security engineers and sales professionals who focus solely on working with various us government agencies and departments 
as a result of this focus we have experienced an increase in government business activity  not only in the us but also around the world 
service revenues 
service revenues consist of maintenance contracts for technical support of our firewall vpn appliances and professional services such as training  consulting and installation 
service revenues increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the increase in service revenues was due primarily to growth in annual maintenance customer support revenues  which represents approximately of total service revenues 
this growth is due to the greater number of installed products during fiscal year resulting from additional product sales  as well as maintenance customer support renewals for products sold in previous years 
revenues from training  consulting and installations were not a significant factor in the growth of service revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year cost of revenues and gross profit 
total cost of revenues  which includes products and services costs  increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  or 
the increase was primarily due to the increased product sales and services revenues for fiscal year total gross profit was for fiscal year and for fiscal year gross profit is affected by a variety of factors including competition  the mix in average selling prices of products we currently offer  new product introduction and enhancements  fluctuation in manufacturing volumes and incremental cost of supporting the increased installed customer base 
gross profit for products was million  or  for fiscal year as compared to million  or  for fiscal year the increase in product related gross profit was a result of new hardware platforms adopted during fiscal year  resulting in lower cost of hardware for our appliances 
gross profit for services was million  or  for fiscal year as compared to million  or  for fiscal year the increase in service related gross profit was a result of the increased installed customer base during fiscal year and strict cost controls for all service related costs 
operating expenses 
for fiscal year  total operating expenses increased to million as compared to million for the fiscal year  or 
as a percentage of total revenues  operating expenses increased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year included in operating expense for fiscal year  was the settlement of a class action lawsuit in the amount of million  which represents our portion of the class action litigation settlement 
excluding the one time charge for this settlement  operating costs were million  or of total revenue 
the increase in total operating expenses in fiscal year from fiscal year  excluding the one time charge  was million  or 
the overall increase in operating expenses is due primarily to the increase in development costs of million  and an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of million 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses includes salaries  non capitalized equipment  software tools and facilities related costs 
for fiscal year  total research and development expenses increased to million from million for fiscal year  or 
the increase is primarily the result of the acquisition of the netoctave  inc assets in the third quarter of fiscal year and additional development employees hired during the year 
as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expenses decreased to in fiscal year compared to for fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include salaries  commissions  human resources  finance  administrative support functions  and legal and accounting professional services 
selling general and administrative expenses increased by million or to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase is due to an increase of approximately million of labor related expenses  including increases in bonuses  commissions and option related payroll costs 
in addition  we recorded amortization expense of  related to the netoctave  inc acquisition transaction as well as  of additional depreciation expense for assets acquired in that transaction 
as a percentage of total revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year class action settlement 
in june  we received an offer to settle an outstanding class action lawsuit for million 
in july  the company entered into a memorandum of understanding to settle this lawsuit 
the settlement amount of million will require the company to incur a one time charge of million in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year ending june  for the amount in excess of the insurance coverage and related costs 
the company s portion of the settlement amount will be payable by the company in cash or in a combination of cash and equity  at the company s option 
the terms of the settlement are subject to approval by the court  and there can be no assurance that the court will approve this proposed settlement of the lawsuit 
net interest income 
net interest income was  for fiscal year compared to net interest income of  for fiscal year the increase in net interest income was primarily the result of the significant increase in cash balances for fiscal year versus fiscal year other income 
other income was  for fiscal year versus  for fiscal year the decrease is the result of less foreign currency gains for fiscal year compared to fiscal year income tax benefit 
we provide a valuation allowance for the portion of our deferred tax assets  which we cannot determine  is more likely than not to be recognized due to our cumulative losses and the uncertainty as to future recoverability 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million as of june   primarily as a result of the reversal of a portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the reversal of the allowance was made because we believe it is more likely than not that this portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
the computation of our deferred tax asset and valuation allowance is based on taxable income we expect to earn over the next two years which will include the utilization of previously accumulated net operating tax losses 
we will continue to evaluate each quarter the amount  if any  of additional reduction of the valuation allowance that should be made 
this will be based on our estimate and conclusions regarding the ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset  including but not limited to  our recent positive financial results as well as projected earnings over a two year period 
the impact of further reductions of the valuation allowance will be to record a tax benefit  which will increase net income in the period the determination is made 
net income loss 
for fiscal year we recorded net income of million compared to a net loss of  for the fiscal year this improvement is the direct result of the increase in revenues for fiscal year versus fiscal year and a continued focus on maintaining appropriate cost controls and operating efficiencies 
fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  total revenues 
total revenues decreased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  or 
this decrease represents a decrease in product revenues  which was offset by a increase in services revenues 
we believe the decrease in product revenues can be attributed to slowing economic conditions that resulted in a delay or deferral in customer spending  changes in our sales and marketing organization and realignment of our direct sales to a reseller distributor model during the year 
we believe the increase in service revenues is due to the growing installed base of our products and renewals of previous years maintenance contracts 
revenues in north america  emea and apac as a percentage of total revenues were approximately  and  respectively  in fiscal year and   respectively  and in fiscal year our total international revenues  which are revenues for customers outside north america  represented approximately of the total revenues in fiscal year and of total revenues in fiscal year one customer represented of total revenue in fiscal year  however  this  customer only accounted for approximately of revenues in fiscal year product revenues 
product revenues consist primarily of firewall and vpn security appliances 
product revenues decreased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  or 
the decrease in product revenues is attributed to slowing economic conditions that resulted in a delay or deferral in customer spending  changes in our sales and marketing organization and realignment of our direct sales to a reseller distributor model during the year 
service revenues 
service revenues consist primarily of maintenance contracts for technical support of our firewall vpn appliances and professional services such as training  consulting and installation 
service revenues increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the increase in service revenues was due primarily to annual maintenance customer support revenues  which represented approximately of the increase 
the increase was also due to the greater number of installed products in fiscal year resulting from additional product sales  as well as service renewals for product sold in previous years 
revenues from training  consulting and installations were not a significant factor in the growth of service revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year cost of revenues and gross profit 
total cost of revenues  which includes products and services costs  decreased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  or 
the decrease was primarily due to the reduced product sales discussed above 
as a percentage of total revenues  costs of revenues were for fiscal year and for fiscal year total gross profit was in fiscal year and in fiscal year gross profit is affected by a variety of factors including competition  the mix in average selling prices of products we currently offer  new product introduction and enhancements  fluctuation in manufacturing volumes and incremental cost of supporting the increased installed customer base 
gross profit for products was million  or  for fiscal year as compared to million  or  in fiscal year the reduction in gross profit was a result of competitive pressures resulting from the economic downturn and the introduction of a lower margin product during fiscal year gross profit for services was million  or  for fiscal year as compared to million  or  in fiscal year the increase in service related gross profit is a result of the increased installed customer base during fiscal year and strict cost controls for all service related costs 
operating expenses 
for fiscal year  total operating expenses decreased to million compared to million for the fiscal year  or 
as a percentage of total revenue  operating expenses decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year the overall decrease in operating expenses can be explained in part by a reduction of the research and development expenses for fiscal year of  and a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses of million 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses include salaries  non capitalized equipment  software tools  and facilities related costs 
the decrease in research and development expenses for fiscal year versus fiscal year is in part the result of the reduction in the number of employees and the reduction in salaries specifically related to a special option salary reduction program 
these items accounted for approximately  of the decrease 
the balance of the decrease is due to the reduction of the use of outside contractors by the development group 
as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expenses decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include salaries  commissions  human resources  finance  administrative support functions  and legal and accounting professional services 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million to million in fiscal year from million during fiscal year the decrease reflects our continued focus on streamlining our operations  making cost effective changes in the way we operate  a reduction in the number of employees and a reduction in salary expense related to a special option salary reduction program 
in fiscal year  we decreased labor costs  marketing costs  other expenses  and professional fees 
as a percentage of total revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year net interest income expenses 
net interest income was  for fiscal year compared to net interest expenses of  for fiscal year the decrease in interest expenses is attributable to the conversion of convertible debt in january of and the pay off of a revolving line of credit facility in december other income expenses 
other income was  for fiscal year compared to other expenses of  for fiscal year the change in other income is a result of a foreign currency translation gain of  in fiscal year compared to a loss of  for fiscal year net loss 
for fiscal year  we incurred a net loss of  versus a net loss of million for fiscal year this improvement is the direct result of our fiscal year cost cutting measures  including reduced numbers of employees  salary reduction  decreased interest and improved operating efficiency 
liquidity and capital resources at june   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash and cash equivalents  which consist principally of commercial paper and us government securities 
for the fiscal year  our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased by million or to million from million at june  cash provided by operating activities was million for the fiscal year for fiscal year cash provided by operating activities was million 
the increase is the result of the significant increase in net income  off set by various charges in current asset and liability accounts 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal year  primarily as a result of the purchase of property and equipment of  capitalized software of  and the cash portion of the acquisition of the netoctave  inc assets for  net cash used in investing activities for fiscal year was  primarily the result of the purchase of property and equipment of  and capitalized software of net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal year and net cash used in financing activities for fiscal year was  in fiscal year  the cash provided by financing activities was primarily the proceeds from stock options exercised 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements at least through the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending on support  product development efforts and expansion of sales and marketing  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancement to existing products  and market acceptance of our products 
we are not aware of any known demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that will result or that are reasonably likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing in a material way 
we cannot assure you that additional equity or financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
currently  we have no agreements or arrangements for third parties to provide us with sources of liquidity and capital resources 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an on going basis  we evaluate significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements  including revenue recognition  bad debt  software development cost  inventory valuation and deferred taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
the discretion involved in this process makes revenue results difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
our revenue is derived from two primary sources product revenue which includes revenue from the sale of our firewall vpn appliance  and service revenue  which is primarily maintenance  related to customer support 
revenue from product sales is recognized only when a contract or agreement has been executed  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and we believe collection is probable 
product revenue is generally recognized on product shipment  this includes the transfer of both title and risk of loss  provided that no significant obligations remain 
there is no product right of return available to the customer 
we defer revenue on product sales for new value added resellers where we are unable to determine the ability of the reseller to honor a commitment to make fixed or determinable payment 
revenue will be deferred until the resellers demonstrate consistency of payment within the terms specified and there are no instances where we have to take back the product because of non payment for a three month period 
service revenue consists primarily of the annual fee for maintenance post contract customer support and maintenance renewals from our existing customers and is recognized ratably on a monthly basis over the service contract term 
the post contract customer support provides our customers access to our worldwide support organization for technical support  unspecified product updates enhancements on a when and if available basis and general security information 
the updates are considered minor enhancements to the software that are not separately marketable or considered a competitive feature or major upgrade 
all products and services are separately contracted 
we also provide other professional support services  such as training and consulting  which are available under service agreements and charged for separately 
these services are generally provided under time and materials contracts and revenue is recognized as the service is provided 
bad debts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
significant judgment is required when we assess the ultimate realization of receivables  including the probability of collection and the credit worthiness of each customer 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze our accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and other factors 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowance might be required 
software development costs 
we capitalize costs related to the development of certain software products in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed which requires capitalization to begin when technological feasibility has been established and ends when the product is available for general release to customers 
software development costs incurred prior to technological feasibility  defined by implementation of a beta project  are considered research and development costs and are expensed as incurred 
capitalized costs are amortized on a straight line method over two years and is the greater of the two amounts calculated using the methods noted in sfas no 
inventory valuation 
inventories consist primarily of component parts and computer hardware and are carried at the lower of cost  determined by the first in first out method  or market 
we write our inventories down to estimated market value based on assumptions of our future demand  based on projected product releases and market conditions 
variation in market trends  customer preferences  introduction of new products replacing existing products or technological advances could  however  significantly affect these estimates and result in additional inventory write downs 
deferred taxes 
we provide a valuation allowance for that portion of deferred tax assets  which it cannot determine is more likely than not to be recognized due to the company s cumulative losses and the uncertainty as to future recoverability 
any reversal of the allowance is made when we believe that it is more likely than not that this portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
the computation of our deferred tax asset and valuation allowance is based on taxable income we expect to earn over the next two years which will include the utilization of previously accumulated net operating tax losses 
we will continue to evaluate each quarter the amount  if any  of additional reduction of the valuation allowance that should be made 
this will be based on management s estimate and conclusions regarding the ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset  including but not limited to  the company s recent positive financial results as well as projected earnings over a two year period 
the impact of further reductions of the valuation allowance will be to record a tax benefit  which will increase net income in the period the determination is made 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize the deferred tax asset  in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period the determination was made 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas no 
amends fasb sfas no

fin is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  we are currently in compliance with the provisions of the new pronouncement 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  for certain entities that do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest variable interest entities 
variable interest entities within the scope of fin will be required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is determined to be the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected returns  or both 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  at june  we were not a party to transactions contemplated under fin in november  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus opinion on eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the consensus provides that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met 
the consideration for the arrangement should be allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  with different provisions if the fair value of all deliverables is not known or if the fair value is contingent on delivery of specified items or performance conditions 
applicable revenue recognition criteria should be considered separately for each separate unit of accounting 
eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  entities may elect to report the change as a cumulative effect adjustment in accordance with apb opinion  accounting changes 
in november the emerging issues task force reached a consensus opinion on eitf  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
eitf requires that cash payments  credits  or equity instruments received  as consideration by a customer from a vendor should be presumed to be a reduction of cost of sales when recognized by the customer in the income statement 
in certain situations  the presumption could be overcome and the consideration recognized either as revenue or a reduction of a specific cost incurred 
the consensus should be applied prospectively to new or modified arrangements entered into after december  at june   we were not a party to transactions contemplated by eitf in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in general  the sfas no 
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
on may   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
sfas no 
affects the issuer s accounting for three types of freestanding financial instruments mandatory redeemable shares  which the issuing company is obligated to buy back in exchange for cash or other assets  instruments that do or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets  includes put options and forward purchase contracts  and obligations that can be settled with shares  the monetary value of which is fixed  tied solely or predominantly to a variable such as a market index  or varies inversely with the value of the issuers shares 
sfas no 
does not apply to features embedded in a financial instrument that is not a derivative in its entirety 
most of the guidance in sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we have not yet completed our analysis of sfas no 
 however  we believe that we are currently substantially in compliance with the requirements of sfas no 
forward looking statements statements regarding future products  including the anticipated dates for introducing such products  future prospects  future profitability  business plans and strategies  future revenues and revenue sources  future liquidity and capital resources  future computer network security market directions  future acceptance of the company s products and possible growth in markets  as well as all other statements contained in this report that are not purely historical are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are based upon assumptions and analyses made by the company in light of current conditions  anticipated future developments and other factors the company believes are appropriate in the circumstances  or upon information obtained from third parties  and are subject to a number of assumptions  risks and uncertainties 
readers are cautioned that forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that the actual results might differ materially from those suggested or projected in the forward looking statements 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the forward looking statements will occur or that results will not vary significantly from those described in the forward looking statements 
some of the factors that might cause future actual events to differ from those predicted or assumed include future advances in technologies and computer security  the company s history of annual net operating losses and the financing of future losses through the sale of assets and newly issued company securities  the company s ability to execute on its business plans  the company s dependence on outside parties such as its key customers and alliance partners  competition from major computer hardware  software  and networking companies  risk and expense of governmental regulation and effects of changes in regulation  the limited experience of the company in marketing its products  uncertainties associated with product performance liability  risks associated with growth and expansion  global economic conditions  changes in customer needs resulting from economic conditions  dependence on information systems  risks associated with obtaining and maintaining patent and intellectual property right protection  uncertainties in availability of expansion capital in the future and other risks associated with capital markets  and the events of september   and its repercussions 
in addition  the forward looking statements herein involve assumptions  risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to economic  competitive  operational  management  governmental  regulatory  litigation and technological factors affecting the company s operations  liquidity  capital resources  markets  strategies  products  prices and other factors discussed elsewhere herein and in the other documents filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
many of the foregoing factors are beyond the company s control 
risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our operations 
if any of the following risks  or any additional risks and uncertainties  were to materialize  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
were that to occur  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
risks related to our business we have incurred significant losses in the past and we may not be able to sustain profitability in the future 
during two of the past three years  we incurred net losses 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
moreover  we currently expect to increase our operating expenses in connection with expanding into new geographic markets  expanding into new product markets  continuing to develop our technology  hiring additional personnel  and upgrading our information and internal control systems 
we have difficulty predicting our future operating results or profitability due to volatility in general economic conditions and in particular with the internet security market 
the overall weakness in the general economy and volatility of demand for our security products are two of the many factors underlying our inability to predict our revenues for a given period 
we base our spending levels for product development  sales and marketing  and other operating expenses largely on expected future revenues 
a large portion of our expenses are fixed for a particular quarter or a year  and therefore we may be unable to decrease our spending in time to compensate for any unexpected quarterly or annual shortfalls in revenues 
as a result  any shortfall in revenue could cause our earnings to decrease or our losses to increase 
our operating results fluctuate and can fall below expectations of analysts and investors  resulting in a decline of our stock price 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have varied in the past and will likely continue to vary in the future due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
any of these factors could cause our stock price to decline 
our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenues and a high percentage of our expenses are  and will continue to be  fixed in the short term 
as a result  lower than anticipated revenues for any reason could cause significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
it is likely that if in some future quarters our operating results fall below expectations of public market analysts and investors  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
seasonality and concentration of revenues at the end of the quarter could cause our revenues to fall below the expectations of analysts and investors  resulting in a decline of our stock price 
the growth rate of our domestic and international sales has been and may continue to be slower in the summer months  when businesses often defer purchasing decisions 
also  as a result of customer buying patterns and the efforts of our sales force to meet or exceed quarterly and year end quotas  historically we have earned a substantial portion of a quarter s revenue during its last month and more recently in the latter half of the last month 
if expected revenues at the end of any quarter are delayed  our revenues for that quarter could fall below the expectations of the analysts and investors and result in a decline in our stock price 
if third party channel partners fail to perform  our ability to sell our products and services will be limited 
we expect to sell most of our products and services through our channel network partners and we expect our success to depend in large part on their performance 
some of our channel partners sell products and services that are competitive with ours  and may devote more resources to those competitive products than they devote to ours or may cease selling our products and services altogether 
if our third party channel partners fail to perform  our ability to expand our business and increase sales will be limited 
we may need to decrease the price of our products  which may reduce our revenues and our ability to generate income 
average selling prices of our products may decrease  which may reduce our gross margins 
the average selling price for our products may decline as a result of competitive pricing pressures  promotional programs and customers who negotiate price reductions in exchange for long term purchase commitments 
the pricing of products depends on specific features and functions of the product  purchase volumes and the level of sales and services support 
we expect competition to increase in the future 
as we experience pricing pressure  we anticipate that the average selling prices and gross margins per product will decrease over product lifecycles 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing and introducing on a timely basis new products with enhanced features  or that these products  if introduced  will enable us to maintain our average selling prices and gross margins at current levels 
our gross margins have been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including competition  the mix in average selling prices of products  new product introduction  enhancements and the cost of components and manufacturing labor 
we must manage each of these factors competitively for our gross margins to remain at their current levels 
we rely primarily on a single manufacturer and assembly house 
the loss of this relationship could result in our being unable to deliver products for an extended period of time 
we outsource all of our hardware manufacturing and assembly primarily to one third party manufacturer and assembly house  omni tech corporation  and we do not have a written contract with this company 
we have only recently established arrangements with an alternative manufacturer and assembly house and we may not be able to meet the demands for our products if we were to lose our relationship with our primary manufacturer and assembly house 
our operations could be disrupted for an extended period of time if we have to switch to a replacement vendor 
an interruption in our hardware supply could result in a loss of customer orders and revenue and diminish the reputation of our brands 
we may underestimate our required inventories  which may result in our inability to deliver products on a timely basis 
we provide forecasts of our demand to our primary contract manufacturer up to three months prior to scheduled delivery of product to our customers 
if we underestimate our requirements  our primary contract manufacturer may have an inadequate component inventory  which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delayed shipments and reduced revenues 
in addition  lead times for materials and components that we order vary significantly and depend on the specific supplier  contract terms  and demand for each component at a given time and other factors 
we may also experience shortages of components from time to time  which also could delay the manufacturing of our products 
we may need to raise additional capital to finance our operations or future growth  and this capital may not be available to us 
our future revenue may be insufficient to support the expense of our operations and the expansion of our business 
as a result  we may seek additional funding through public or private equity financing  public or private debt financing  and or capital lease transactions 
we believe that our cash on hand  cash equivalents and net working capital will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  our capital requirements will depend on several factors  including the rate of market acceptance of our products and services  our ability to expand our customer base  the growth of our sales and marketing capabilities  and the cost of any acquisitions we may complete 
we may decide at any time to raise additional capital to take advantage of available strategic opportunities or attractive financing terms 
if we issue equity securities  shareholders may experience dilution or the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock 
if we cannot raise any required additional funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operating our business 
if we are unable to meet our future capital requirements  our business would be harmed 
because many potential customers remain unaware of the need for internet security or may perceive it as costly and difficult to implement  our products and services may not achieve market acceptance 
we believe that many potential customers are not fully aware of the need for internet security products and services 
historically  only enterprises having substantial resources have developed or purchased internet security solutions 
also  there is a perception that internet security is costly and difficult to implement 
we will therefore not succeed unless the market understands the need for internet security and we can convince our potential customers of our ability to provide this security in a cost effective manner 
although we have spent and will continue to spend considerable resources educating potential customers about the need for internet security and the benefits of our products and services  our efforts may be unsuccessful 
the market for internet security products and services is highly competitive and we may not have the resources to compete effectively 
the market for internet security products is intensely competitive and characterized by frequent technological change 
we believe that competition in this market is likely to persist and intensify as demand for network security products continues to increase 
in market segments requiring the highest levels of network security  we compete with secure computing corporation  which also offers a firewall with a security enhanced operating system 
we also compete with security vendors such as check point software technologies ltd  cisco systems  inc  and netscreen technologies  inc 
these companies products may be considered to be alternatives to our products that could eventually compete with our firewall vpn products 
our failure to address strain on our resources caused by growth will result in our inability to effectively manage our business 
our current systems  management and resources will be inadequate if we continue to grow at a significant rate 
a rapid expansion of our business will place a significant strain on our administrative  operational and financial resources and will result in increasing responsibilities of our management personnel 
we will be unable to effectively manage our business if we are unable to timely and successfully alleviate the strain on our business caused by rapid growth 
we may be unable to adequately expand our operational systems to accommodate growth  which can harm our ability to deliver our products and services 
our operational systems have not been tested at customer volumes that may be required in the future 
we may encounter performance difficulty when operating with a substantially greater number of customers 
an inability to add additional operating systems and personnel to handle increased demands may cause unanticipated disruptions in our current processes  slower response times and poor customer service  including problems filling customer orders 
rapid changes in technology and industry standards could render our products and services unmarketable or obsolete and we may be unable to introduce new products and services timely and successfully 
to succeed we must continually change and improve our products in response to rapid technological developments and changes in operating systems  internet access and communications  application and network software  computer and communication hardware  programming tools  computer language technology and hacker techniques 
we may be unable to successfully and timely develop these new products and services or achieve and maintain market acceptance 
the development of new  technologically advanced products and services is a complex and uncertain process requiring innovation and the ability to anticipate technological and market trends 
because internet security technology is complex it can require long development and testing periods 
releasing new products and services prematurely may result in quality problems  and releasing them late may result in loss of customer confidence and market share 
in the past we have on occasion experienced delays in the scheduled introduction of new and enhanced products and services  and we may experience delays in the future 
when we do introduce new or enhanced products and services  we may be unable to manage the transition from the older products and services to minimize disruptions to the customers ordering patterns  avoid excess inventory of older products and deliver enough products and services to meet customer demand 
we may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with the alleged or actual failure of our products and services 
because our products provide internet security and protect valuable information  we may face claims for product liability  tort or breach of warranty relating to our products and services 
anyone that circumvents our products security measures could misappropriate the confidential information or other property of end users using our products and services or interrupt their operations 
if that happens  affected end users or channel partners may sue us 
in addition  we may face breaches caused by faulty installations and implementations of our products by end users or channel partners 
although we attempt to reduce the risk of loss from claims through contractual or warranty disclaimers and liability limitation provisions  these provisions may be unenforceable 
some courts  for example  have found contractual limitations of liability in standard software licenses to be unenforceable because the licensee does not sign them 
defending a suit regardless of its merit could be costly and could divert management s attention 
although we currently maintain business liability insurance  this coverage may be inadequate or be unavailable in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
a breach in security could harm public perception of our products 
we will not succeed unless the marketplace is confident that we provide effective internet security protection 
even networks protected by our products may be vulnerable to electronic break ins and computer viruses 
if an actual or perceived breach of internet security occurs in an end user system  regardless of whether the breach is attributable to us  the market perception of the efficiency and effectiveness of our products and services could be harmed 
this could cause us or our channel partners to lose current and potential customers or cause us to lose potential channel partners 
because the technology used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks changes frequently and generally is not recognized until launched against the target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 
if we are unable to prevent attacks on our internal network security system by computer hackers  public perception of our products and services will be harmed 
because we provide internet security  we are a significant target of computer hackers 
we have experienced attacks by computer hackers in the past and expect the attacks to continue 
if attacks on our internal network systems are successful  public perception of our products and services will be harmed 
we may be unable to deliver our products and services if we cannot continue to license third party technology that is important for the functionality of our products 
our success will depend in part on our continued ability to license technology that is important for the functionality of our products 
we depend on our third party licenses to deliver reliable high quality products  develop new products on a timely and cost effective basis and respond to evolving technology and changes in industry standards 
we also depend on the continued compatibility of third party software with future versions of our products 
an interruption in the supply of third party technology could delay our development and sales until we can find  license and integrate equivalent technology 
this could damage our brand and result in loss of current and potential customers 
we have no written contracts to license third party technology in the future  however  we believe we can find other sources for the technology we need for our products 
if the alternative technology is available  we cannot be assured that it will be on acceptable terms 
we will be unable to deliver our products and services if component manufacturers fail to supply component parts with acceptable quality  quantity and cost 
we obtain the component parts for our hardware from a variety of manufacturers 
while our component vendors have produced parts for us in acceptable quantities and with acceptable quality and cost in the past  they may be unable to do so in the future 
companies in the electronic industry regularly experience lower than required component allocations and this industry is subject to frequent component shortfalls 
although we believe we can find additional or replacement sources for our hardware components  our operations could be disrupted if we have to add or switch to a replacement vendor or if our components supply is interrupted 
this could result in a loss of customer orders and revenue 
declines in demand for our products and services would cause our revenues and profitability to decrease 
if overall market demand for computers  servers and other computing devices declines significantly  and consumer and corporate spending for such products declines  our revenue growth will be adversely affected 
additionally  our revenues would be unfavorably impacted if customers reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades to existing products if such new offerings are not perceived to add significant new functionality or other value to prospective purchasers 
a reduction in the growth of internet usage and a softening demand for our products and services caused by the ongoing economic downturn may result in decreased revenue  earnings or growth rates and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and realize customer receivables 
we depend on the government  telecommunications  financial services  computing and manufacturing industries for a significant portion of our revenues 
significant reduction in technology capital spending in these industries caused by recent adverse economic conditions may continue to result in decreased revenues and earnings 
our revenues are dependent on the level of technology capital spending in the united states and international economies 
a number of companies announced significant reductions and deferrals in capital spending 
further delays or reductions in information technology spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and consequently our results of operations  prospects and stock price 
our failure to effectively develop new products could harm our ability to generate revenues in the future 
the development of software products is a complex and time consuming process 
new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods 
significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products could negatively impact our ability to market and sell our products in the future 
if we do not retain our key employees  our ability to execute our business strategies and provide our products and services will be impaired 
our future success will depend on the efforts and ability of our senior management and our key development  technical  operation  information systems  customer support  and sales and marketing personnel  and on our ability to retain them 
these employees are not obligated to continue their employment with us and may leave us at any time 
the loss of key employees would impair our ability to develop competitive products and provide appropriate levels of service to our customers 
if we do not expand our international operations  the growth of our business will be limited 
our ability to grow depends in part on the expansion of our international sales and operations  which we expect to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues 
sales to customers outside the united states accounted for approximately of our revenues in fiscal year  in fiscal year and in fiscal year the failure of our channel partners to sell our products internationally will limit our ability to increase our revenues 
our international operations result in export and currency risks  which may make our operations less profitable 
our international sales are subject to the risks inherent in international business activity  including cost of customizing products for foreign countries  export and import restrictions  including those affecting encryption commodities and software  difficulties in acquiring and authenticating customers information  reduced protection of intellectual property rights and increased liability exposure  and regional economic and political conditions 
significant portions of our international sales currently are us dollar denominated 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies may make our products less competitive in the international markets 
we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights  which may limit our ability to compete effectively 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may misappropriate or infringe on our trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks  service marks and similar proprietary rights 
we face additional risk when conducting business in countries  which have poorly developed or inadequately enforced intellectual property laws 
while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists we expect piracy to be a continuing concern  particularly in international markets and as a result of the growing use of the internet 
intellectual property claims and litigation could subject us to significant liabilities for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights 
in the future we may have to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to develop the validity and scope of proprietary rights with respect to intellectual property  which we have licensed from others 
any litigation  regardless of its success  would be costly and require significant time and attention of our key management and technical personnel 
the litigation could also force us to stop or delay selling  incorporating or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  pay damages  enter into licensing or royalty agreements  which may be unavailable under acceptable terms  or redesign products and services that incorporate infringing technology 
we may face infringement claims from third parties in the future 
the software industry has seen frequent litigation over intellectual property rights  and we expect that participants in the internet security industry will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products  services  and competitors grows and functionality of the products and services overlap 
we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary rights or that third parties will not independently develop substantially similar products  services and technology 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that our products will not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties 
we may not be able to avoid infringement of third party intellectual property rights and may have to obtain a license  defend an infringement action  or challenge the validity of the intellectual property rights in court 
failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights in our products  for any reason  could have a material adverse effect on us 
undetected product errors or defects could result in loss of revenues or claims against us 
our products and services may contain undetected errors or defects  especially when first released 
despite extensive testing  some errors are discovered only after a product has been installed and used by customers 
any errors discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or claims against our channel partners or us 
we are subject to shareholder litigation claims that could result in large payments by us  which would reduce our earnings or increase our losses 
we are currently defending a class action lawsuit relating to a restatement of our financial results 
we have entered into a memorandum of understanding relating to the settlement of this lawsuit  which resulted in our incurring a one time charge of million in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
a portion of this amount will be payable in cash or in a combination of cash and stock  at our option 
the terms of the settlement are subject to approval by the court  and there can be no assurance that the court will approve this proposed settlement of the lawsuit 
if the court does not approve the settlement  there can be no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in defending the lawsuit  or that if we are unsuccessful  that there will be sufficient insurance coverage to cover any judgment rendered against us 
we are unable to make any estimates regarding the potential liability related to this litigation if the court does not approve the proposed settlement 
governmental controls over the export or import of encryption technology could cause us to lose sales 
any additional governmental regulations of imports or exports  or failure to obtain required approval for our encryption technologies could adversely affect our international and domestic sales 
the united states and various other countries have imposed controls  export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies  especially encryption technology 
in addition  from time to time governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation over encryption technology  including  for example  requiring the escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys 
additional regulation of encryption technology could delay or prevent the acceptance and use of encryption products in public networks for secure communications 
this in turn could result in decreased demand for our products and services 
in addition  some foreign competitors are subject to less stringent controls on exporting their encryption technologies 
as a result  they may be able to compete more effectively than we can in the us and international security markets 
one of our shareholders owns a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock and may be able to significantly effect the outcome of shareholder votes 
richard l 
scott  a former member of our board of directors  beneficially owned as of june   directly or indirectly   shares of our common stock  or approximately of our common stock outstanding as of that date 
accordingly  mr 
scott may be able to significantly effect the outcome of certain shareholder votes  including votes concerning the election of directors  the adoption or amendment of provisions in our articles of incorporation  and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions 
this level of concentrated ownership by one person may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in the management or voting control of us 
our articles of incorporation and florida law contain provisions that could discourage third parties from acquiring us or limit the price that they would be willing to pay for our stock 
certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws  as well as the florida business corporation act  may have an anti takeover effect and may discourage  delay  defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider to be in its best interest  including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by the shareholders 
certain of such provisions allow our board of directors to authorize the issuance of preferred stock with rights superior to those of the common stock 
these anti takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of shareholders to benefit from a change in control or to change our management and our board 
our business will suffer if we fail to comply with recent federal regulations and future rules of the securities and exchange commission relating to corporate governance reform 
as a public company  we are subject to certain federal regulations and the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission 
on july   president george w 
bush signed into law the sarbanes oxley act of  effecting tighter accounting  corporate fraud and securities laws 
with this legislation  the sec has adopted new rules pertaining to  among other things  audit committee requirements and additional disclosure and reporting requirements 
our reputation and financial results could be materially harmed by any failure by us to comply with any current or future rules or regulations relating to the sarbanes oxley act or to any other federal corporate reform measures 
there is a limited public market for our common stock 
our common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq national market 
the market for our common stock has historically been characterized by limited trading volume and a limited number of holders 
there can be no assurance that a more active trading market for our common stock will develop 
see price range of common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments or derivative equity securities 
financial investments  which potentially subject the company to a concentration of credit risk  principally consist of cash  cash equivalents and trade receivables 
the company holds any excess cash in short term investments consisting of commercial paper 
concentration of credit risk with respect to receivables is limited due to the company s customer base and historical collection rates 
foreign currency risk 
the majority of our sales and the majority of our expenses are currently denominated in us dollars 
as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains and losses except those disclosed on f in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
while we conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during and and expect to do so in the future  we do not anticipate the foreign currency gains or losses will be material to cyberguard 
although we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date  we may do so in the future
