such statements include  in particular  statements about our plans  strategies  prospects  changes and trends in our business and the markets in which we operate under the heading management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  could  would  should  expect  plan  anticipate  intend  believe  estimate  predict  potential or continue or the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology 
these statements are only predictions 
actual events or results may differ materially because of market conditions in our industries or other factors

accordingly  you should not rely on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results 
in addition  our estimates of future operating results are based on our current complement of businesses  which is constantly subject to change as we implement our fix  sell or grow strategy 
overview we are a global multi industry company that is focused on profitably growing a number of platform businesses that have scale and growth potential 
we are a multinational corporation with operations in over countries and approximately  employees worldwide 
our strategy is to create market advantages through technology  service and product leadership by expanding our market focus to offer full customer solutions and by building critical mass through strategic acquisitions 
our business strategy is focused on an integrated leadership process that aligns performance measurement  decision support  compensation and communication 
we are a global provider of technical products and systems  industrial products and services  flow technology and service solutions 
our products are used by a broad array of customers in various industries  including chemical processing  pharmaceuticals  infrastructure  mineral processing  petrochemical  telecommunications  financial services  transportation and power generation 
below is a summary of certain highlights included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
acquisitions all business acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the statements of consolidated income include the results of each acquired business since the date of acquisition 
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at preliminary estimates of fair values as determined by management based on information available 
final purchase price allocations are based on independent appraisals and management estimates 
we finalize the allocation of purchase price to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed when we obtain information sufficient to complete the allocation  but in any case  within one year after acquisition 
as a result of acquisitions  we incur integration expenses for the incremental costs to exit and consolidate activities at the acquired companies locations  to involuntarily terminate employees  and other costs to integrate operating locations and other activities of the acquired companies with us 
united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requires us to reflect these acquisition integration expenses  to the extent that they are not associated with the generation of future revenues and have no future economic benefit  as assumed liabilities in the allocation of the purchase price to the net assets acquired 
on the other hand  these same principles require us to record acquisition integration expenses associated with integrating our existing operations into acquired company locations as period expenses 
these expenses are recorded as special and other charges and are discussed later in this section 
acquisition integration liabilities are based on our integration plans  which generally focus on three key areas of integration manufacturing process and supply chain rationalization  including plant closings  elimination of redundant administrative overhead and support activities  and restructuring and repositioning sales and marketing organizations to eliminate redundancies 
we expect that the termination of employees and consolidation of facilities will be substantially complete within one year of the date of acquisition 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues from product sales upon shipment to the customer  except for revenues from service contracts and long term maintenance arrangements  which are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the agreement period  and revenues from certain construction and installation contracts  which are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue is recognized based on effort or costs incurred to date as compared to total estimated effort or cost of the total contract 
certain sales to distributors made with return rights and or price protection features are recognized upon shipment to the customer 
expected returns under these contracts are approximately of total revenues  can be reasonably estimated and are accrued for at the time of sale  and either a restocking charge is assessed on a return up to of sales price  or the customer must issue a replacement order before the return is authorized 
amounts billed for shipping and handling are included in revenue 
in addition  costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of products sold and not netted against amounts billed 
special and other charges as part of our value improvement process  we right size and consolidate operations to drive results 
from time to time we alter our business model to better serve customer demand  fix or discontinue lower margin product lines and rationalize and consolidate manufacturing capacity to maximize operating results 
as an outcome of this process  we may incur special and other charges primarily associated with restructuring initiatives to consolidate manufacturing and sales facilities  rationalize certain product lines and asset impairments 
the components of the charges are computed based on actual cash payouts  our estimate of the realizable value of the affected tangible and intangible assets and estimated exit costs including severance and other employee benefits based on existing severance policies and local laws 
the purpose of restructuring initiatives is to improve profitability  streamline operations  reduce costs  and improve efficiency 
we estimate that we will achieve operating cost reductions in and beyond through reduced employee and manufacturing costs and other facility overhead 
the estimated period in which we realize savings on our restructuring actions is on average approximately twelve months from the date of completion 
for restructuring actions announced in  we estimate that costs savings in the twelve months following the date of completion will be approximately per year 
estimated costs savings will be realized in cost of products sold and selling  general  and administrative expenses 
emerging issues task force no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring provides specific requirements as to the appropriate recognition of costs associated with employee termination benefits and other exit costs 
employee termination costs are recognized when management  having the appropriate level of authority to involuntarily terminate employees  approves and commits us to the plan of termination  establishes the benefits that current employees will receive upon termination  and prior to the date of the financial statements  the benefit arrangement is communicated to employees 
the communication of the benefit arrangement includes sufficient detail to enable employees to determine the type and amount of benefits they will receive if they are terminated 
all restructuring actions taken by the company are expected to be completed within one year from the time of announcement 
other exit costs are costs resulting from an exit plan that are not associated with or that do not benefit activities that will be continued 
we record those costs when they are not associated with or are not incurred to generate revenues after the exit plan s commitment date  and they meet either of the following criteria the costs are incremental to other costs that we incur in the conduct of our activities prior to the commitment date and will be incurred as a direct result of the exit plan  or the costs represent amounts that we will incur under a contractual obligation that existed prior to the commitment date and will either continue after the exit plan is completed with no economic benefit to us or be a penalty incurred by us to cancel the contractual obligation 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing or other exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
replaces eitf and is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we frequently engage in strategic restructuring and integration initiatives that include exit and disposal activities 
accordingly  we expect that sfas no 
could impact the way in which we account for certain restructuring costs 
in particular  sfas no 
may impact the timing and amount of recorded restructuring costs as certain costs previously accrued at the date a restructuring action is initiated must now be expensed as incurred 
we continually review whether events and circumstances subsequent to the acquisition of any long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of those assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of those assets may not be recoverable 
if events and circumstances indicate that the long lived assets  including intangible assets subject to amortization  should be reviewed for possible impairment  we use projections to assess whether future cash flows or operating income before amortization on a non discounted basis related to the tested assets are likely to exceed the recorded carrying amount of those assets to determine if a write down is appropriate 
if impairment is identified  a loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the impaired assets exceeds their fair values as determined by applying the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  or sfas no 
 in see new accounting pronouncements in this section for further discussion 
these charges can vary significantly from period to period and as a result  we may experience fluctuations in our reported net income and earnings per share due to the timing of restructuring actions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our special and other charges 
litigation and environmental matters numerous claims  complaints and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business  including but not limited to those relating to environmental matters  competitive issues  contract issues  intellectual property matters  personal injury and product liability claims  and workers compensation have been filed or are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries 
additionally  we may become subject to significant claims of which we are unaware currently or the claims that we are aware of may result in our incurring a significantly greater liability than we anticipate 
this may also be true in connection with past or future acquisitions 
while we maintain property  cargo  auto  product  general liability  and directors and officers liability insurance and have acquired rights under similar policies in connection with our acquisitions which we believe cover a portion of these claims  this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 
in addition  we have been increasing our self insurance limits over the past several years 
while we believe we are entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims  these rights may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 
in our opinion  these matters are either without merit or are of a kind that should not have a material adverse effect individually or in the aggregate on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
however  we cannot assure you that recoveries from insurance or indemnification claims will be available or that any of these claims or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
it is our policy to comply fully with applicable environmental requirements 
we are currently involved in various investigatory and remedial actions at our facilities and at third party waste disposal sites 
an estimate of loss  including expenses  from legal actions or claims is accrued when events exist that make the loss or expenses probable and we can reasonably estimate them 
our environmental accruals cover anticipated costs  including investigation  remediation  and operation and maintenance of clean up sites 
our estimates are primarily based on investigations and remediation plans established by independent consultants  potentially responsible third parties  and regulatory agencies at third party offsite disposal locations 
accordingly  our estimates may change based on future developments including new or changes in environmental laws or policies  a difference in costs required to complete anticipated actions from estimates provided  future findings of investigation or remediation actions  or alteration to the expected remediation plans 
it is our policy to realize a change in estimates once it becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
in determining our accruals  we do not discount environmental or other legal accruals and do not reduce them by anticipated insurance recoveries 
we do take into account third party indemnification from financially viable parties in determining our accruals where there is no dispute regarding the right to indemnification 
while we believe that our accruals related to environmental  litigation  and claims are sufficient and that these items and our rights to available insurance and indemnity will be resolved without material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity  individually or in the aggregate  we cannot assure you that our accruals and right to indemnity and insurance will be sufficient or that these items will be resolved without a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity  individually or in the aggregate 
use of estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on experience  current and expected future conditions  third party evaluations and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
listed below are the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
certain other estimates and assumptions are further explained in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate loses for uncollectable accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable and the evaluation of the likelihood of success in collecting the receivable 
impairment of long lived assets and intangibles subject to amortization we continually review whether events and circumstances subsequent to the acquisition of any long lived assets  or intangible assets subject to amortization  have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of those assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of those assets may not be recoverable 
if events and circumstances indicate that the long lived assets should be reviewed for possible impairment  we use projections to assess whether future cash flows on a non discounted basis related to the tested assets are likely to exceed the recorded carrying amount of those assets  to determine if a write down is appropriate 
should impairment be identified  a loss would be reported to the extent that the carrying value of the impaired assets exceeds their fair values as determined by valuation techniques appropriate in the circumstances that could include the use of similar projections on a discounted basis 
in determining the estimated useful lives of definite lived intangibles  we consider the nature  competitive position  life cycle position  and historical and expected future operating cash flows of each acquired asset  as well as our commitment to support these assets through continued investment and legal infringement protection 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually to determine whether the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets exceed their implied fair value 
the fair value of reporting units is based on discounted projected cash flow but we also consider factors such as market capitalization and comparable industry price multiples 
we employ cash flow projections that are believed to be reasonable under current and forecasted circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of the reported net assets of our reporting units 
many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets that they serve 
accordingly  estimates and judgments that effect the future cash flow projections including principal methods of competition including volume  price  service  product performance and technical innovations are considered 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information 
accrued liabilities we make estimates and judgments in establishing accruals as required under gaap  including the following legal it is our policy to accrue for estimated losses from legal actions or claims  including legal expenses  when events exist that make the realization of the loss or expenses probable and they can be reasonably estimated 
in  we settled approximately of legal claims and related fees previously accrued for in connection with product disputes  patent litigation  supplier disputes and other commercial claims 
environmental remediation costs costs incurred to investigate and remediate environmental issues are expensed unless they extend the economic useful life of related assets 
liabilities are recorded and expenses are reported when it is probable that an obligation has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
our environmental accruals cover anticipated costs  including investigation  remediation  and operation and maintenance of clean up sites 
our estimates are primarily based on investigations and remediation plans established by independent consultants  regulatory agencies and potentially responsible third parties 
environmental obligations are not discounted and are not reduced by anticipated insurance recoveries 
in  we paid approximately associated with environmental remediation and received approval from the state of connecticut for a favorable remedial action plan to address a soil contamination site  which reduced our remediation obligation by self insurance we are primarily self insured for workers compensation  automobile  product  and general liability costs and we believe that we maintain adequate reserves to cover our retained liability 
our accrual for self insurance liability is determined actuarially  based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
we maintain third party stop loss insurance policies to cover all liability costs in excess of predetermined amounts 
warranty in the normal course of business we issue product warranties for specific product lines and provide for the estimated future warranty cost in the period in which the sale is recorded 
we provide for the estimate of warranty cost based on contract terms and historical warranty loss experience that is periodically adjusted for recent actual experience 
because warranty estimates are forecasts that are based on the best available information  claims costs may differ from amounts provided 
adjustments to initial obligations for warranties are made as changes in the obligations become reasonably estimable 
financial instruments we use interest rate swaps to manage our exposures to fluctuating interest rate risk on our variable rate debt portfolio 
we use interest rate swaps as a cash flow hedge to reduce the risk of fluctuating interest rates by fixing a known cash flow that will be expended at future dates for the payment of interest 
we do not enter into financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
these rules require that derivative instruments be reported in the consolidated financial statements at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are to be recorded each period in earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether the derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedged transaction and on the type of hedge transaction 
gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in other comprehensive income must be reclassified as earnings in the period in which earnings are affected by the underlying hedged item  and the ineffective portion of all hedges must be recognized in earnings in the current period 
these standards can result in additional volatility in reported earnings  other comprehensive income and accumulated other comprehensive income 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impact of these standards 
initially  upon adoption of the derivative accounting requirements  and prospectively  on the date a derivative contract is entered into  sfas no 
requires that a qualifying derivative be designated as either a hedge of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment a fair value hedge  a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability a cash flow hedge  or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation a net investment hedge 
we formally document our hedge relationships  including identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction 
derivatives are recorded in the balance sheets at fair value in other assets or other liabilities 
we also formally assess  both at inception and quarterly thereafter  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item 
the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps  which are designated as cash flow hedges  is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of tax 
ineffectiveness is recorded as a component of interest expense 
changes in fair value are assessed quarterly based on dealer quotes 
stock based compensation we have a stock based compensation plan  including stock option and restricted stock awards 
we account for our stock based employee compensation under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and  accordingly  no stock option expense is recognized 
we have adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for the disclosure information required under sfas no 
business segment information we are a global multi industry company that is focused on profitably growing our businesses that have scale and growth potential 
our strategy is to create market advantages through technology  service and product leadership  by expanding our market focus to offer full customer solutions and by building critical mass through strategic acquisitions 
we aggregate certain operating segments in accordance with the criteria defined in sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the primary aggregation factors considered in determining the segments were the nature of products sold  production processes and types of customers for these products 
in determining our segments  we apply the threshold criteria of sfas no 
to operating income or loss of each segment before considering special and other charges  including those recorded in cost of products sold 
this is consistent with the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the results of each segment 
our results of operations are reported in four segments technical products and systems  industrial products and services  flow technology and service solutions 
technical products and systems the technical products and systems segment focuses on solving customer problems with complete technology based systems and services 
our emphasis is on growth through investment in new technology  new product introductions  alliances  and acquisitions 
this segment includes operating units that design  manufacture and market laboratory and life science products and services  security and integrated building life safety systems and services  broadcast and communications systems  network and switching products and services and electrical test and measurement solutions 
industrial products and services the strategy of the industrial products and services segment is to provide productivity solutions for industry 
this segment emphasizes introducing new related services and products  as well as focusing on the replacement parts and service elements of the segment 
this segment includes operating units that design  manufacture and market power systems  compaction equipment  engineered components and subsystems  material handling equipment and systems and heat and ventilation products 
flow technology the flow technology segment designs  manufactures and markets solutions and products that are used to process or transport fluids and heat transfer applications 
this segment includes operating units that design and manufacture cooling technology products and services  process and fluid handling equipment and boilers and hyrdronic products 
service solutions the service solutions segment consists of three primary units diagnostic systems and service equipment  specialty tools and technical information and services 
the strategy of this segment is to focus on the design  manufacture and marketing of a wide range of specialty service tools  hand held diagnostic systems and service equipment  inspection gauging systems  and technical and training information  primarily for the franchised vehicle dealer industry in north america and europe 
major customers are franchised dealers of motor vehicle manufacturers  aftermarket vehicle service facilities  and independent distributors 
seasonality  competition and trends many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets that they serve 
in addition  certain businesses have seasonal fluctuations 
our technical products and systems and flow technology segments tend to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters due to the purchasing patterns of customers at these businesses 
the industrial products and services segment is usually strongest in the second quarter primarily due to the seasonal demand for products of the compaction equipment division reported in this segment 
the service solutions segment revenues primarily follow program launch timing for diagnostic systems and service equipment  the largest unit in this segment 
in aggregate  our businesses generally tend to be stronger in the second half of the year  particularly in the fourth quarter 
as described in the following section  we expect operating profits derived from the power generation markets to be to lower than which will predominately impact the first half of accordingly  we expect reported net income in the second half of to be stronger than the first half on a relative basis compared with prior years 
although our businesses operate in highly competitive markets  our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since our competitors do not offer all of the same product lines or serve all of the same markets 
in addition  specific reliable comparative figures are not available for many of our competitors 
in most product groups  competition comes from numerous concerns  both large and small 
the principal methods of competition are price  service  product performance and technical innovations 
these methods vary with the type of product sold 
we believe we can compete effectively on the basis of each of these factors as they apply to the various products we offer 
see item business for discussion of competitors by business 
in  we reported revenues of  compared to  in organic revenues  which are revenues excluding acquisitions or dispositions  declined approximately in compared to the decline in organic revenues was a result of many factors including  but not limited to  global economic conditions  particularly conditions in us industrial markets  and the negative impact of volume and pricing dynamics at our power systems and networking solutions businesses 
we define forecasted trends as follows soften future organic revenues are expected to have an unfavorable trend in compared to the prior year  continue future trends are expected to be similar in compared to the prior year  strengthen future organic revenues are expected to have a favorable trend in compared to the prior year 
primary platforms that experienced organic revenue growth for the year are summarized below 
also summarized is the annual forecasted trend based on information available on the date of this report 
segment platform annual forecasted trend comments technical products and systems security and integrated building life safety systems continue despite continued softness in us non residential building construction  the unit is expected to continue realizing single digit organic revenue growth from continued demand for security  compliance and litigation services  as well as high end fire detection products 
broadcast and communication systems and services continue supported by the high definition tv  or hdtv  rollout in the us and the ability to provide turn key systems to customers  this unit is expected to realize single digit organic revenue growth 
industrial products and services compaction equipment continue this unit experienced gains in market share in resulting in organic revenue growth for the year 
the road construction markets are expected to remain soft and without continued market share gains  organic revenues in this business will be flat 
growth is expected in the asian market with the opening of a new manufacturing facility near shanghai  china in this unit is highly cyclical by quarter  with the second quarter traditionally the highest revenue period in the year 
engineered components and subsystems continue this unit experienced low single digit organic revenue growth in the unit is expected to perform at similar levels due to continued demand for aerospace defense components and high integrity die cast parts 
the demand for car and light truck vehicles in the us strongly influences the demand for filtration and die cast products included in this unit and accordingly  the actual organic revenues for this unit 
flow technology cooling technologies and services soften low single digit organic revenue growth was experienced in revenue performance is expected to soften in due to the impact of revenue declines in the us power market offsetting the global demand for cooling technology products and services 
primary platforms that experienced organic revenue declines for the year are summarized below 
also summarized is the annual forecasted trend based on information available on the date of this report 
segment platform annual forecasted trend comments technical products and systems laboratory and life science products strengthen organic revenues were down slightly in  with future organic revenue growth expected for this unit 
capital spending in the laboratory and life science markets is expected to be supplemented with new repository business as well as continued demand for bio preparation  processing and storage equipment 
networking and switching products continue demand and pricing behavior of storage networking customers is expected to continue 
electrical test and measurement solutions continue demand for telecommunication line management systems is expected to remain below prior year levels 
in addition  demand for automated fare collection systems is highly correlated to contract timing on large municipal contracts  which causes fluctuations from quarter to quarter 
industrial products and services power systems soften power generation end markets continue to experience reduced demand and pricing pressures 
accordingly  our power systems unit experienced a sharp decline in revenues in the second half of this trend is expected to continue with revenues expected to decline in this business by over in compared to in  operating profits derived from the power generation markets are expected to decline to  which includes the negative effect that the power market is expected to have at our cooling technologies platform 
flow technology fluid systems continue cyclical demand for short cycle products in power  chemical and mineral processing and industrial markets is expected to remain soft 
service solutions specialty tools and technical information and services strengthen the primary demand for products in this segment is driven from new vehicle launches  new vehicle technology  such as integrated electronics  and regulatory changes 
while the outlook for domestic oem dealer and aftermarket tools is consistent with the prior year  slightly higher organic revenues are expected due to regulatory changes and new vehicle launches in europe 
joint ventures we have two primary joint ventures egs electrical group  llc and assa abloy door group  llc 
egs electrical group  llc the egs electrical group is a joint venture with emerson electric co 
in which we hold a interest 
egs operates primarily in the united states  canada and mexico and is engaged in the manufacture of electrical fittings  hazardous location lighting  and power conditioning products 
we account for our investment under the equity method of accounting  on a three month lag basis 
we typically receive the majority of our share of this joint venture s earnings in cash dividends 
assa abloy door group  llc the assa abloy door group is a joint venture with assa abloy in which we hold a interest 
the joint venture is engaged in the manufacture  sale and distribution of door products 
at the formation of the joint venture on may  we received in cash 
we account for our investment under the equity method of accounting and we typically receive the majority of our share of this joint venture s earnings in cash dividends 
the joint venture agreement includes a put and call arrangement that allows for the sale of our interest in the joint venture to assa abloy in june for a minimum price of in cash 
if we put or assa abloy calls our ownership interest  no loss will be recorded and as specified in the put and call agreement  the final settlement price for our interest will be calculated based upon a pre determined formula  which may result in a sales price greater than any sales price in excess of would result in a corresponding gain 
we intend to exercise our put right 
results of operations on may   we completed the acquisition of united dominion industries limited udi 
udi manufactured proprietary engineered and flow technology products primarily for industrial and commercial markets worldwide 
udi  which had sales of  for the twelve months ended december   is included in our financial statements beginning may  accordingly  the acquisition of udi significantly impacts the results of operations in  which include the results of udi for the entire period  including cost reductions associated with the integration of the udi businesses  whereas includes the results of udi from may  in the second quarter  we completed our review and determination of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the udi acquisition and finalized our accounting for this acquisition 
in addition to the acquisition of udi  during we completed fifteen acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of  net of cash acquired 
in the aggregate  the acquired companies had revenues of  and in the twelve months prior to the respective dates of acquisition in the technical products and systems  industrial products and services and flow technology segments  respectively 
during  we completed thirteen acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of  net of cash acquired 
in the aggregate  based on information provided by the sellers  the companies had revenues of   and in the twelve months prior to the respective dates of acquisition in the technical products and systems  industrial products and services  flow technology and service solutions segments  respectively 
these acquisitions are not material individually or in the aggregate 
for further discussion on acquisitions and divestitures  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and the amortization provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  were effective for any business combination initiated after july  we have not amortized goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for acquisitions completed after this date 
with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july   we adopted the remaining provisions of sfas no 
effective january  upon adoption of this standard  we ceased amortization of all remaining goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives 
in connection with the transition provisions of sfas no 
 we have recorded a change in accounting principle  which resulted in a non cash charge to earnings of in the first quarter of pro forma performance results consolidated pro forma results regulation s x of the securities and exchange commission stipulates that the md a shall cover the three year period covered by the financial statements and shall use year to year comparisons or other formats that in the registrant s judgment enhance a reader s understanding 
further  it is stipulated that where the consolidated financial statements reveal material changes from year to year in one or more line items  the causes for the changes shall be described to the extent necessary to an understanding of the registrant s business as a whole  provided  however  that if the causes for a change in one line items also related to other line items  no repetition is required and a line by line analysis of the financial statements as a whole is not required or generally appropriate 
with revenues for the twelve months ended december  of  and  for spx and udi  respectively  udi increased our revenues by approximately 
accordingly  we believe that the following pro forma results of operations will facilitate a more meaningful analysis of our results of operations 
unaudited pro forma results of operations for the years ended december   and are presented below as if the acquisition of udi  which was acquired on may   took place on january  on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

the following and pro forma results assume that the cessation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets had occurred on january  we believe that the following pro forma results of operations will facilitate more meaningful analysis of our results of operations 
the pro forma results include estimates and assumptions that management believes are reasonable

research and development internal research and development costs are expensed to selling  general  and administrative expense  as incurred

after technological feasibility is established  additional costs are capitalized in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed until the product is available for general release 
such costs are amortized over the lesser of three years or the economic life of the related products and the amortization is included in cost of products sold 
we expensed as a component of selling  general  and administrative expense  approximately of research and development costs in  in and in pension plans we recorded net pension income of in  in  and in the calculation of pension benefit income uses an expected rate of return on plan assets 
the difference between the estimated return and the actual return is treated as an unrecognized gain or loss and this amount is amortized into the calculation of pension results in future periods 
as of december   the aggregate unrecognized loss position of our pension plans was the majority of this unrecognized loss stems from the unexpected recent decline in the performance of us financial markets coupled with historic lows in interest rates 
future net pension income or expense is dependent upon many factors including level of employee participation in the plans  plan amendments  discount rates and the changes in market value of the plans assets  which  in turn depends on a variety of economic conditions 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that future periods will include similar amounts of net pension income 
based on an assumed expected long term rate of return on assets of in and the change in our unrecognized loss position during  we expect net pension income to decrease by approximately in the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors  including returns on invested assets and the level of market interest rates 
the recent dramatic declines in the performance of the us financial markets coupled with historic lows in long term interest rates have resulted in a underfunded status for our pension plans compared to a funded status at december  our german pension plans account for of the underfunded status at december   as plans in germany are typically not funded in accordance with local regulations 
we made no cash contributions to our primary domestic pension plans in the underfunded status of our primary domestic pension plans did not have any impact on required cash contributions in and we do not expect to make any material cash contributions in in accordance with accounting rules  when the accumulated benefit obligation of a pension plan exceeds the plan assets  a minimum pension liability must be recognized 
as a result of the decline in the funded status of our pension plans for reasons described above  we were required to record an adjustment to increase our minimum pension liability at december  this adjustment also required the elimination of the pension asset previously recorded as a result of the historical over funded position of our pension plans 
we recorded this non cash  non income statement adjustment  net of tax  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statement of shareholders equity 
the total pension adjustment amount recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive loss account at december  was weighted average pension assumptions at december  and december  include the following december  weighted average actuarial assumptions used were discount rate rate of increase in compensation levels expected long term rate of return on assets the discount rate and rate of increase in compensation levels for were used to value our benefit obligation and funded status as of december  the expected long term rate of return on assets was used to calculate the pension benefit income for a one percentage point increase or decrease to the assumed expected long term rate of return of our primary domestic pension plans would have a relative effect on net pension income 
the expected long term rate of return assumption for the pension benefit income calculation is expected to be approximately 
it is our policy to review the pension assumptions annually 
pension benefit income is determined using assumptions as of the beginning of the year  while the funded status is determined using assumptions as of the end of the year 
the assumptions are established at the respective balance sheet date based on consultation with independent actuaries using the following principles the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is established based upon historical actual asset returns and the expectations of asset returns over the expected period to fund participant benefits based on the current investment mix of our plans  the discount rate is set based on the yield of high quality fixed income investments  commonly defined as fixed income investments with at least a moody s aa credit rating  and the rate of increase in compensation levels is established based on management s expectations of current and foreseeable future increases in compensation 
in addition  a benchmark study completed by our independent actuaries has shown that our choice of assumptions is comparable to other organizations with a plan measurement date of december income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we periodically assess the realizability of deferred tax assets and the adequacy of deferred tax liabilities including the results of local  state  federal or foreign statutory tax audits or estimates and judgments used 
realization of deferred tax assets associated with the net operating loss and credit carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration 
we believe that there is a risk that certain of these net operating loss and credit carryforwards may expire unused and  accordingly  have established a valuation allowance against them 
although realization is not assured for the remaining deferred tax assets  we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable earnings or alternative tax strategies 
however  deferred tax assets could be reduced in the near term if our estimates of taxable income during the carryforward period are significantly reduced or alternative tax strategies are no longer viable 
the valuation allowance increased by in  and in the amount of income tax that we pay annually is dependent on various factors  including the timing of certain deductions 
these deductions can vary from year to year and consequently  the amount of income taxes paid in future years may be greater than amounts paid in and undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately at december  a deferred tax estimate of has been provided for the foreign earnings of certain subsidiaries 
with the exception of these subsidiaries  the remaining foreign earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested 
accordingly  no provision for us federal and state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes has been made 
if these earnings were distributed  we would be subject to us income taxes subject to a reduction for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries 
determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred us income tax liability is not practicable  however  unrecognized foreign tax credit carryovers would be available to reduce some portion of the us liability 
withholding taxes of approximately would be payable upon remittance of all previously unremitted earnings at december  liquidity and financial condition listed below are the cash flows from used in operating  investing and financing activities and the net change in cash and cash equivalents for the twelve months ended  and cash flows from operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows from used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and equivalents in  cash flows from operating activities were compared to cash flows from operating activities of in the decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to cash spending on restructuring activities compared to in  the discontinuance of a vendor financing program at our compaction equipment business which resulted in a cash outflow of  and a net increase in working capital outflows 
the increase in restructuring spending as compared to  was primarily due to the completion of udi integration actions as well as the completion of previously initiated restructuring actions 
at december   a total of of restructuring liabilities remained on the consolidated balance sheet as disclosed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
with the exception of certain multi year operating lease and other contractual obligations  we anticipate that the liabilities related to restructuring actions will be paid within one year from the period in which the action was initiated 
in addition  we expect to take charges against earnings in in connection with implementing additional cost reduction actions at certain of our businesses 
we have estimated these charges to be between and  but they could be higher or lower than this range 
where we cannot fully quantify the amount of cash and non cash portion of the charges in  we expect that the operating cash outflow associated with these actions will also be in the range of to the primary driver of the working capital outflows in was the timing of certain payments  which were partially offset with working capital improvements  measured as a percent of revenue  at our service solutions segment  our flow technology segment  and our compaction equipment business  as well as cash received from a legal award 
in  cash flows used in investing activities were  a decrease of compared to cash flows used in investing activities of in the decrease was primarily due to the following proceeds from asset sales in were compared to in cash proceeds from asset sales in were primarily composed of the divestures of a non strategic machinery and material handling product line  as well as sales of non core plant and equipment 
cash proceeds from asset sales in were generated from the disposition of seven product lines as well as received from the sale of our door products business into a joint venture with assa abloy whereby we also received a ownership in the joint venture 
cash used for business acquisitions was  or  greater in as compared to in  acquisition spending included cash used for the udi acquisition as well as for the acquisition of kendro  our largest bolt on acquisition in history in terms of purchase price 
excluding the cash spent in for kendro and udi  cash used for acquisitions increased  or  as compared to as we completed thirteen bolt on acquisitions in cash used for capital expenditures was in compared to in the decrease in capital expenditures was primarily due to the fact that results included incremental spending on various plant expansion projects as well as new capital deployed at the recently acquired udi businesses 
in addition  was positively impacted by a disciplined cost containment program to reduce capital spending in businesses that are experiencing cyclical end market demand changes 
a measure of cash flow performance used by analysts and investors that follow multi industrial companies is free cash flow which is defined as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures 
cash flows from operating activities of   in  and  respectively  less respective capital expenditures of  and resulted in free cash flow in  and of  and  respectively 
in  cash used in financing activities was compared to cash from financing activities of in the change resulted from the following net borrowings of in compared to in in  we amended and restated our senior credit facility  which resulted in a net reduction of our variable rate debt portfolio  and we paid down of other indebtedness 
these payments were offset by the issuance of in senior notes in december net borrowings in were higher than primarily due to the issuance of the february lyons and the refinancing of debt acquired from udi 
in  we repurchased shares of our common stock for in cash 
we did not repurchase any common stock in in  we received from the exercise of stock warrants 
this was offset by of cash paid for other financing activities including the termination of four interest rate swaps 
in  cash flows from operating activities were compared to cash flows from operating activities of in excluding cash received from the inrange ipo and the in taxes paid in on the sale of best power  operating cash flow increased the increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to increased cash net income and improvements in working capital 
non cash charges to net income for depreciation and amortization of goodwill and intangibles increased by from the prior year due to the acquisition of udi 
improvements in working capital were realized largely due to implementation of our value improvement process at the former udi units  which reinforces appropriate use of capital 
the changes in working capital were primarily from improvements in inventory turns and accounts payable days outstanding

restated credit agreement on july   we refinanced our existing tranche b and tranche c term loans and amended and restated our credit agreement 
the primary purpose of the july refinancing and amendment of our credit agreement was to modify certain covenant provisions to provide for enhanced overall flexibility  as well as increased flexibility for international growth and to extend the maturity of our tranche b and tranche c term loans 
the refinancing did not impact the terms or applicable rates on our tranche a term loans or our revolver

under the restated credit agreement covenants  our ability to pay cash dividends in a fiscal year is limited to the lesser of or of our consolidated net income in the immediate preceding fiscal year  if our consolidated leverage ratio  pro forma for a cash dividend  is greater than to if this ratio is less than to  we have the ability to pay cash dividends in a fiscal year in an amount up to of our consolidated net income in the immediate preceding fiscal year  which in was based on available information  we do not expect these covenants to restrict our liquidity  financial condition or access to capital resources in the foreseeable future 
we are permitted to prepay the tranche a  tranche b and the tranche c term loans in whole or in part at any time without penalty or premium 
we are not allowed to reborrow any amounts that we repay on the tranche a  tranche b or tranche c term loans 
the final maturity for each loan is as follows date of final maturity revolving loans march  tranche a term loans march  tranche b term loans september  tranche c term loans march  the restated credit agreement also requires scheduled principal payments of the term loans and mandatory prepayments from net proceeds arising in connection with certain asset sales or dispositions and issuances of subordinated debt under certain circumstances

letters of credit and swing line loans are also available under the revolving credit facility 
on the date of the closing of the restated credit agreement  no revolving loans were outstanding 
the facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit in us dollars  euros  and pounds sterling at any time during the revolving availability period  in an aggregate amount not exceeding letters of credit issued under this facility reduce the aggregate amount available under the revolving loan commitment 
early extinguishment of debt during  we recorded an charge for the write off of financing fees associated with the early extinguishment of debt as a result of the july and december refinancing described above 
this charge was recorded as a component of interest expense 
in the first quarter of  we paid down our existing tranche b debt of and revolver of  and replaced the existing credit facility with a new  credit facility 
we recorded a charge associated with the early extinguishment of debt as a result of this refinancing 
this charge was recorded as a component of interest expense 
these charges were accounted for in accordance with eitf  debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments as well as sfas no 
senior notes on december   we issued of senior notes pursuant to our universal shelf registration statement which allows for the issuance of an additional of securites after consideration of these notes 
these notes mature on january  the net proceeds of were used to refinance the tranche a term loan of our senior credit facility  reduce the tranche b and tranche c term loans of our senior credit facility and for general corporate purposes  including the possible repayment of debt 
these notes are unsecured and rank equally with all of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness  but are effectively junior to our senior secured debt and obligations of our subsidiaries 
the indenture governing the notes contains a number of covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries  other than inrange and any other unrestricted subsidiary under the indenture  to incur additional debt  pay dividends and repurchase stock  make other restricted payments  including  without limitation  investments  create liens  enter into sale leaseback transactions  enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries  sell or otherwise dispose of assets  including capital stock of subsidiaries  enter into transactions with our affiliates  and enter into mergers or consolidations 
as of december   our capacity to make restricted payments  which include paying cash dividends  purchasing subordinated debt prior to maturity and making restricted investments  was limited to the covenants contained in the indenture are subject to a number of qualifications and limitations 
under the indenture  none of our subsidiaries are prohibited from paying dividends to us 
liquid yield option notes on february   we issued liquid yield option tm notes february lyons at an original price of per  principal amount at maturity  which represents an aggregate initial issue price of and an aggregate principal amount of due at maturity on february  on may   we issued liquid yield option tm notes may lyons at an original price of per  principal amount at maturity  which represents an aggregate initial issue price including the over allotment exercised by the original purchaser of and an aggregate principal amount due at maturity on may  the lyons have a yield to maturity of per year  computed on a semi annual bond equivalent basis  calculated from the date of issuance 
we will not pay cash interest on the lyons prior to maturity unless contingent interest becomes payable 
the lyons are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and are debt instruments subject to united states federal income tax contingent payment debt regulations 
even if we do not pay any cash interest on the lyons  bondholders are required to include interest in their gross income for united states federal income tax purposes 
this imputed interest  also referred to as tax original issue discount  accrues at a rate equal to on the february lyons and on the may lyons 
the rate at which the tax original issue discount accrues for united states federal income tax purposes exceeds the stated yield of for the accrued original issue discount 
in the event that either the february or may lyons are put to the company or redeemed by the company  the respective imputed interest deduction less the original issue discount of would be recaptured at the time of the put or redemption 
the amount of the recapture calculated on the first put date is approximately and on may  and february   respectively 
the lyons are subject to conversion to spx common shares only if certain contingencies are met 
these contingencies include our average stock price exceeding predetermined accretive values of spx s stock price each quarter see below  during any period in which the credit rating assigned to the lyons by either moody s or standard poor s is at or below a specified level  upon the occurrence of certain corporate transactions  including a change in control 
in addition  a holder may surrender for conversion  at the accreted value  a lyon for redemption even if it is not otherwise convertible at such time 
the conversion rights based on predetermined accretive values of spx s stock include  but are not limited to  the following provisions february lyons may lyons initial conversion rate shares of common stock per lyon initial stock price initial accretion percentage accretion percentage decline per quarter conversion trigger prices for the next twelve months first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter holders may surrender lyons for conversion into shares of common stock in any calendar quarter  if  as of the last day of the preceding calendar quarter  the closing sale price of our common stock for at least trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of such preceding calendar quarter is more than the specified percentage beginning at and declining per quarter thereafter for the february lyons  beginning at and declining per quarter thereafter for the may lyons of the accreted conversion price per share of common stock on the last trading day of such preceding calendar quarter 
the accreted conversion price per share as of any day will equal the issue price of a lyon plus the accrued original issue discount to that day  divided by the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of a lyon on that day 
we may redeem all or a portion of the february lyons for cash at any time on or after february  at predetermined redemption prices 
february lyons holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their lyons on february  for per lyon  february  for per lyon  or february  for per lyon 
we may redeem all or a portion of the may lyons for cash at any time on or after may  may lyons holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their lyons on may  for per lyon  may  for per lyon or may  for per lyon 
for either the february lyons or may lyons  we may choose to pay the purchase price in cash  shares of common stock or a combination of cash and common stock 
there are various factors that a lyon holder would use in deciding to exercise their put option 
these factors include the price and volatility of our common stock  the interest yield on the lyons above the risk free interest rate and other quantitative and qualitative factors 
based upon these factors  at the time of the filing of this form k  we believe that it is probable  but cannot determine with certainty  that the holders of the may lyons will exercise their put right and require us to repurchase the majority or all of their lyons on may  if all the may lyons were settled in cash on may   we would be required to pay the holders approximately accordingly  the accreted value of the may lyons at december   has been classified as current in our consolidated balance sheet at december  under gaap  the lyons are not included in the diluted income per share of common stock calculation unless a lyon is expected to be converted for stock or one of the three contingent conversion tests summarized above are met 
if the lyons were to be put  we expect to settle them for cash and none of the contingent conversion tests have been met  accordingly  they are not included in the diluted income per share of common stock calculation 
if converted  the february lyons and may lyons would be exchanged for a total of shares of our common stock 
if the lyons had been converted as of january   the diluted income per share of common stock from continuing operations would have been per share for the period ended december  other financing agreements our compaction equipment business  part of the industrial products and services segment  utilizes an accounts receivable securitization facility pursuant to which the unit has an agreement to sell  on a revolving basis without recourse  certain qualified receivables  of which had been sold under the agreement at december  the agreement allows for the sale of up to of certain qualified receivables to an unaffiliated third party entity and continues on an evergreen revolving basis unless we provide a three month notice under the agreement to discontinue the facility 
we expect to utilize the agreement in the foreseeable future 
if we did not renew the contract  the impact on our financial condition or cash flows would not be material 
previously  our compaction equipment business also utilized a vendor financing program that was discontinued during the second quarter of as of december   except for the following items  we do not have any other material guarantees  off balance sheet arrangements or purchase commitments of certain standby letters of credit outstanding  of which reduce the available borrowing capacity on our revolving loans and approximately of surety bonds 
of the total letters of credit and surety bonds outstanding at december   is commercial bid  performance or warranty arrangements related to sales contracts with customers of which the fees are reimbursed by the customer 
financial instruments we have entered into interest rate protection agreements swaps to hedge the potential impact of increases in interest rates on our variable rate debt portfolio 
our swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges and as of december   we had outstanding swaps with maturities to november that effectively convert  of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate of approximately 
as a result of the restated credit agreement  we extended the maturities of our variable rate tranche a term loans to march  tranche b term loans to september and tranche c terms loans to march associated with these extended maturities  we entered into additional variable to fixed rate interest rate swap agreements beginning in and maturing in as of december   the pre tax accumulated derivative loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss was and a long term liability of has been recorded to recognize the fair value of these swaps 
the ineffective portion of these swaps in and has been recognized in earnings as a component of interest expense and is not material 
we do not enter into financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
in  in connection with the restated credit agreement  we terminated four interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount at a cash cost of these interest rate swaps were included in the portfolio of interest rate swaps designated as a cash flow hedge of our variable rate debt portfolio 
because a portion of the future interest payments hedged by these swaps was no longer probable of occurring  we recognized in interest expense to reclassify into earnings  from accumulated other comprehensive loss  the fair value of the portion of the swap portfolio that no longer is probable of occuring 
current liquidity and principal payments we use operating leases to finance certain asset purchases when economically supported by our internal evaluation model 
these leases are primarily used to fund capital equipment programs to match payment terms with the expected production use of the equipment  although the expected useful or economic life of the asset is greater 
at december   we had of future minimum rental payments under leases with remaining non cancelable terms in excess of one year 
the following is a summary of our primary contractual obligations contractual obligations total due within year due within years due within years due after years accounts receivable securitization short term debt long term debt future minimum lease payments total contractual cash obligations our compaction equipment business  part of the industrial products and services segment  utilizes an accounts receivable securitization facility pursuant to which the unit has an agreement to sell  on a revolving basis without recourse  certain qualified receivables 
see the debt section of this md a for more information on this financing arrangement 
represents the accreted value of the may lyons as of december  represents rental payments under leases with remaining non cancelable terms in excess of one year 
we do not expect to make any material cash contributions to our primary domestic pension plans in the near future 
in  we made cash contributions of pursuant to our postretirement benefit plan obligations and we expect to make a similar level of contributions to these plans in at december   we had of cash available for use and an unused revolver under our restated credit facility 
when adjusted by the of letters of credit outstanding at january   of the revolver was available for use 
we believe that current cash and equivalents  cash flows from operations and our unused revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund working capital needs  planned capital expenditures  other operational cash requirements  and required debt service obligations 
in addition  we have the ability and may elect to refinance the lyons  if put  with other debt 
we have a shelf registration statement for shares of common stock that may be issued for acquisitions and we have filed a shelf registration statement enabling us to sell up to  of securities of which has been used for the offering of our senior notes in december the remaining availability under this shelf registration statement may be used in connection with an offering of debt securities and or common stock for general corporate purposes or for the refinancing of existing debt 
in addition  other financing instruments may be used from time to time including but not limited to private placement instruments  operating leases  capital leases  and securitizations 
we expect that we will continue to access these markets as appropriate to maintain liquidity and to provide sources of funds for general corporate purposes or to refinance existing debt 
in the first quarter of we entered into an agreement to securitize and sell  on a continuous basis  up to of accounts receivable 
it is expected that in mid we will utilize all or a portion of the amount available amount under this agreement 
we were in compliance with all covenants included in our capital financing instruments as of december  and at december   the date of the most recent refinancing 
we have not paid cash dividends in  or  and we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments  trade accounts receivable and interest rate protection agreements 
cash and temporary investments and our interest rate protection agreements are placed with various high quality financial institutions throughout the world  and exposure is limited at any one institution 
we periodically evaluate the credit standing of these financial institutions 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to our interest rate protection agreements  but have no other off balance sheet credit risk of accounting loss 
we anticipate  however  that counter parties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts 
we do not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk  but we do monitor the credit standing of counter parties 
concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are due to selling to a large number of customers in a particular industry 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions and obtain collateral or other security when appropriate 
no one customer accounts for more than of our revenues 
we continually review each of our businesses pursuant to our fix  sell or grow strategy 
these reviews could result in selected acquisitions to expand an existing business or result in the disposition of an existing business 
additionally  we have stated that we would consider a larger acquisition  more than  in revenues  if certain criteria are met 
there can be no assurances that these acquisitions will not have an impact on our capital financing requirements  will be integrated successfully  or that they may not have a negative effect on our operations 
in addition factors that may affect future results that follows  business segment information included in the md a on page of this form k and item 
business included on page of this form k should be read for an understanding of the risks  uncertainties  and trends facing our businesses 
new accounting pronouncements the following is a summary of new accounting pronouncements that apply or may apply to our business 
on july   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these pronouncements change the accounting for business combinations  goodwill and intangible assets 
the requirements of sfas no 
are effective for any business combination accounted for by the purchase method that is completed after june  and the amortization provisions of sfas no 
apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 as required  on january see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the impact of adopting sfas no 
and sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that asset retirement obligations that are identifiable upon acquisition and construction  and during the operating life of a long lived asset be recorded as a liability using the present value of the estimated cash flows 
a corresponding amount would be capitalized as part of the asset s carrying amount and amortized to expense over the asset s useful life 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
effective january  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and also supersedes the provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual  and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas no 
retains the requirements of sfas no 
to a recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flow and b measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
sfas no 
establishes a single model for accounting for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
as required  we have adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective january   and the effect of adoption was not material to our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
this statement rescinds sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  and an amendment of that statement  sfas no 
 extinguishments of debt made to satisfy sinking fund requirements 
this statement also rescinds sfas no 
 accounting for intangible assets of motor carriers 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for leases  to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
this statement also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
effective july   we early adopted the provisions of sfas no 
in accordance with the provisions regarding the gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt  we recorded a charge  to interest expense  as a result of our july and december refinancings 
in addition  in  we had previously recorded a pre tax loss on early extinguishment of debt as an extraordinary item 
in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
 we have  in this presentation of results  reclassified the pre tax loss to interest expense and the related tax benefit of to income tax expense 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the loss on early extinguishment of debt recorded in in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing or other exit or disposal activities 
previous accounting guidance was provided by eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
replaces eitf and is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we frequently engage in strategic restructuring and integration initiatives that include exit and disposal activities 
accordingly  we expect that sfas no 
will impact the timing of recognition of certain restructuring costs  but will not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that a guarantor must recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation that it has undertaken in issuing a guarantee 
fin also addresses the disclosure requirements that a guarantor must include in its financial statements for guarantees issued  including matters such as commercial product warranties 
the disclosure requirements in this interpretation are effective for financial statements ending after december  the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we have not completed our evaluation of fin and we have not assessed the impact the adoption may have on our financial position or results of operations 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for the additional disclosure information as required by fin in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and requires prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
as of december   we have adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas and will continue to account for stock based compensation under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements 
fin requires that unconsolidated variable interest entities be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries and applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to existing entities in the periods beginning after june  currently  fin will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations  however  we will adopt the provisions of fin  at such time as they become applicable to our business 
factors that may affect future results our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility 
at december   we had approximately  in total indebtedness 
on that same date  we had of available borrowing capacity under our revolving senior credit facility after giving effect to reserved for letters of credit outstanding  which reduce the availability under our revolving senior credit facility 
in addition  at december   our cash balance was see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
subject to certain restrictions set forth in the senior credit facility and the indenture  we may incur additional indebtedness in the future  including indebtedness incurred to finance  or which is assumed in connection with  acquisitions 
we may in the future renegotiate or refinance our senior credit facility with agreements that have different or more stringent terms or split our senior credit facility into two or more facilities with different terms 
the level of our indebtedness could limit cash flow available for general corporate purposes  such as acquisitions and capital expenditures  due to the ongoing cash flow requirements for debt service  limit our ability to obtain  or obtain on favorable terms  additional debt financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures or acquisitions  limit our flexibility in reacting to competitive and other changes in the industry and economic conditions generally  expose us to a risk that a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows due to economic developments or adverse developments in our business could make it difficult to meet debt service requirements  and expose us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because the existing borrowings are  and any new borrowings may be at variable rates of interest  which could result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal of  to pay interest on  or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations  including our obligations to repurchase the liquid yield option notes lyons if the holders of the lyons require us to repurchase their securities beginning in may for the may lyons and february for the february lyons will depend upon our future operating performance  which may be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  business and other factors beyond our control 
we will not be able to control many of these factors  such as the economic conditions in the markets in which we operate and initiatives taken by our competitors 
in addition  there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness 
if we are unable to service our indebtedness  whether in the ordinary course of business or upon acceleration of such indebtedness  we may be forced to pursue one or more alternative strategies  such as restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness  selling assets  reducing or delaying capital expenditures  revising implementation of or delaying strategic plans or seeking additional equity capital 
if we are required to take any of these actions  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions  that these actions would enable us continue to satisfy our capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements 
we may not be able to finance future needs or adapt our business plan to changes in economic or business conditions because of restrictions placed on us by our senior credit facility  the indenture governing our senior notes and any existing or future instruments governing our other indebtedness 
our senior credit facility  the indenture governing our notes and other agreements governing our other indebtedness contain  or may contain  a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors and creditors unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied 
we also must comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests 
in some cases  our subsidiaries are subject to similar restrictions that may restrict their ability to make distributions to us 
in addition  our senior credit facility and these other agreements contain or may contain additional affirmative and negative covenants as described under management s discussion and analysis 
all of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities  such as acquisitions  as they arise 
if we do not comply with these or other covenants and restrictions contained in our senior credit facility  the indenture governing our senior notes and other agreements governing our indebtedness  we could be in default under those agreements  and the debt  together with accrued interest  could then be declared immediately due and payable 
if we default under our senior credit facility  the lenders could cause all of our outstanding debt obligations under our senior credit facility to become due and payable  require us to apply all of our cash to repay the indebtedness or prevent us from making debt service payments on any subordinated indebtedness we owe 
if our debt is accelerated  we may not be able to repay our debt or refinance it 
even if we are able to obtain new financing  we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it 
in addition  any default under our senior credit facility or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
if the indebtedness under our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes is accelerated  we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts due under our senior credit facility  our senior notes  or the lyons that we have issued  or under other debt securities then outstanding 
our ability to comply with these provisions of our senior credit facility  the indenture and other agreements governing our other indebtedness may be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control 
in addition  complying with our covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to us and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions 
our failure to successfully integrate recent acquisitions  as well as any future acquisitions  could have a negative effect on our operations  our acquisitions could cause unexpected financial difficulties 
as part of our business strategy  we evaluate potential acquisitions in the ordinary course  some of which could be material 
we made thirteen acquisitions in for an aggregate purchase price of our acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial  managerial and operational challenges  including adverse effects on our reported operating results due to charges to earnings  including impairment charges associated with goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles  diversion of management attention from running our existing businesses  difficulty with integration of personnel and financial and other systems  increased expenses  including compensation expenses resulting from newly hired employees  increased foreign operations that may be difficult to assimilate  assumption of known and unknown liabilities and increased litigation  and potential disputes with the sellers of acquired businesses  technology  services or products 
we may not be able to integrate successfully the technology  operations and personnel of any acquired business 
our integration activities may place substantial demand on our management  operational resources and financial and internal control systems 
customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business  technology  service or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business 
in addition  any acquired business  technology  service or product could underperform relative to our expectations 
we also could experience financial or other setbacks if any of the businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future have problems or liabilities of which we are not aware or that are substantially greater than we anticipate 
in addition  as a result of future acquisitions  we may further increase our debt level  or if we issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions  significantly dilute our existing shareholders 
we may not achieve the expected cost savings and other benefits of our acquisitions 
as a result of our acquisitions  we incur integration expenses for the incremental costs to exit and consolidate activities  to involuntarily terminate employees  and for other costs to integrate operating locations and other activities of these companies with us 
a significant portion of these expenses are cash expenses 
generally accepted accounting principles require that these acquisition integration expenses  which are not associated with the generation of future revenues and have no future economic benefit  be reflected as assumed liabilities in the allocation of the purchase price to the net assets acquired 
on the other hand  these same principles require that acquisition integration expenses associated with integrating our operations into locations of the acquired company must be recorded as expense 
accordingly  these expenses are not included in the allocation of the purchase price of the company acquired 
over the past five years  we have recorded several special charges to our results of operations associated with cost reductions  integrating acquisitions and achieving operating efficiencies 
we believe that our actions have been required to improve our operations and  as described above  we will  if necessary  record future charges  which may be material  as appropriate to address costs and operational efficiencies 
our plan is to achieve cost savings associated with integrating our acquisitions 
this plan is sometimes a consideration in the price we are willing to pay for acquisitions 
our current integration strategy for acquisitions focuses on three key areas of cost savings manufacturing process and supply chain rationalization  including plant closings  elimination of redundant administrative overhead and support activities  and restructuring and repositioning sales and marketing organizations to eliminate redundancies in these activities 
while we anticipate that we will achieve cost savings associated with integrating our acquisitions  cost savings expectations are inherently estimates that are difficult to predict and are necessarily speculative in nature 
in addition  we cannot assure you that unforeseen factors will not offset the estimated cost savings or other benefits from our acquisitions 
as a result  our actual cost savings  if any  and other anticipated benefits could differ or be delayed  compared to our estimates and the other information contained in this report 
we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at our prior rate  which could negatively impact us 
we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at similar rates to our past acquisition rates  which could materially impact our growth rate  results of operations  cash flows and stock price 
our ability to continue to achieve our goals may depend upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire companies  businesses and product lines  to effectively integrate them and to achieve cost effectiveness 
we also may need to raise additional funds to consummate these acquisitions 
in addition  changes in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to consummate acquisitions 
competition for acquisitions in our business areas could also result in higher prices for these businesses  which may also impact our acquisition rate or the success rate of our acquisitions 
the loss of key personnel and any inability to attract and retain qualified employees could materially adversely impact our operations 
we are dependent on the continued services of our management team  including our chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer 
the loss of these personnel without adequate replacement could have a material adverse effect 
additionally  we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and manufacturing industry experience in order to operate our business successfully 
from time to time  there may be a shortage of skilled labor  which may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain qualified employees 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our costs to do so increase significantly  our operations would be materially adversely affected 
many of the industries in which we operate are cyclical  and  accordingly  our business is subject to changes in the economy  pressure from original equipment manufacturers to reduce costs could adversely affect our business 
many of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles 
certain businesses are subject to industry cycles  including  but not limited to  the automotive industries  which influence our service solutions and industrial products and services segments  the electric power and infrastructure markets  which influence our industrial products and services and flow technology segments  process equipment  chemical and petrochemical markets  which influence our flow technology segment  the non residential facility construction markets which influence our technical products and systems and industrial products and services segments and the laboratory and life science markets and the storage and data networking markets which influence our technical products and systems segment 
accordingly  any downturn or competitive pricing pressures in those or other markets in which we participate could adversely affect us 
the recent difficulties at enron  dynegy  nrg and other independent power producers has led to a change in the buying habits of some customers in the power generation markets 
demand and price levels for transformers dropped in and the demand for cooling towers in this market softened in the second half of accordingly  we expect that in  operating profit from these products will be lower by approximately to with a majority of the impact occurring in the first half of a decline in automotive sales and production may not only affect our sales of components  tools and services to vehicle manufacturers and their dealerships  but also sales of components  tools and services to aftermarket customers  and could result in a decline in our results of operations or a deterioration in our financial condition 
similar cyclical changes could also affect aftermarket sales of products in our other segments 
there is also substantial and continuing pressure from the major original equipment manufacturers  particularly in the automotive industry  to reduce costs  including the cost of products and services purchased from outside suppliers such as us 
if in the future we were unable to generate sufficient cost savings to offset price reductions  our gross margins could be materially adversely affected 
if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in any given quarter or period 
the downturns in the business cycles of our different operations may occur at the same time  which could exacerbate any material adverse effects to our business

in addition  certain of our businesses have seasonal fluctuations 
in aggregate  our businesses generally tend to be stronger in the second half of the year  particularly in the fourth quarter 
as described above  we expect operating profits derived from the power generation markets will predominately impact the first half of accordingly  we expect reported net income in the second half of to be significantly stronger than the first half on a relative basis compared with prior years 
consistent with most multi industry  capital goods companies  our businesses have been impacted in by the soft economic conditions 
there can be no assurance that the economic downturn will not worsen or that we will be able to sustain existing or create additional cost reductions to offset economic conditions  and the unpredictability and changes in the industrial markets in the current environment could continue and may adversely impact our results 
cost reduction actions often result in charges against earnings 
we expect to take charges against earnings in in connection with implementing additional cost reduction actions at certain of our businesses 
we have estimated these charges to be between and  but they could be higher or lower than this range 
these charges can vary significantly from period to period and as a result  we may experience fluctuations in our reported net income and earnings per share due to the timing of restructuring actions  which in turn can cause fluctuations in our stock price 
further  the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on experience  current and expected further conditions  third party evaluations and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
certain estimates and judgments that affect the future cash flow projections including principal methods of competition including volume  price  service  product performance and technical innovations are considered 
actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the financial statements and related notes 
if future cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles  a material non cash charge to earnings could result 
at december   we had goodwill and intangible assets of approximately  and shareholders equity of approximately  effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
states that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas no 
 we recorded a non cash impairment charge of during the first quarter of as a policy  we will conduct annual impairment testing to determine if we will be able to recover all or a portion of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles 
if future cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles  we may be required to write off a portion of the balance 
many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets that they serve 
accordingly  estimates and judgments that effect the future cash flow projections including principal methods of competition including volume  price  service  product performance and technical innovations are considered 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
based on the results of the impairment testing performed  no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles exists as of december  we continue to monitor impairment indicators in the industries and markets with cyclical demand and pricing behavior including storage networking  telecommunications  power systems and industrial hydraulic power units and controlled force tools 
a portion of our revenues are generated through long term fixed price contracts which could expose us to various risks including the risks of cost overruns  inflation and credit risks associated with certain customers 
a portion of our revenues estimated at less than and earnings are generated through long term fixed price contracts 
we recognize revenues from certain of these contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting whereby revenue and expenses  and thereby profit  in a given period are determined based on our estimates as to the project status and the costs remaining to complete a particular project 
to the extent that we underestimate the remaining cost to complete a project  we may overstate the revenues and profit in a particular period 
further  certain of these contracts and our other contracts provide for penalties for failure to timely perform our obligations under a contract  or require that we  at our expense  correct and remedy to the satisfaction of the other party  certain defects 
we may enter into additional long term fixed price contracts of this type or other performance obligations in the future and there is no assurance that expenses relating to these provisions will not have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
we are subject to environmental and similar laws and potential liability relating to certain claims  complaints and proceedings  including those relating to environmental and other matters  arising in the ordinary course of business 
we are subject to various environmental laws  ordinances  regulations  and other requirements of government authorities in the united states and other nations 
these requirements may include  for example  those governing discharges from and materials handled as part of our operations  the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by petroleum products or hazardous substances or wastes  and the health and safety of our employees 
under certain of these laws  ordinances or regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigation  removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances or petroleum products on  under  or in its property  without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or caused  the presence of the contaminants  and regardless of whether the practices that resulted in the contamination were legal at the time they occurred 
the presence of  or failure to remediate properly  these substances may have adverse effects  including  for example  substantial investigative or remedial obligations and limitations on the ability to sell or rent that property or to borrow funds using that property as collateral 
under certain of these laws  ordinances or regulations  a party that disposes of hazardous substances or wastes at a third party disposal facility may also become a responsible party required to share in the costs of site investigation and environmental remediation 
in connection with our acquisitions and divestitures  we may assume or retain significant environmental liabilities 
although we perform extensive due diligence with respect to acquisitions  divestitures and continuing operations  there may be environmental liabilities of which we are not aware 
future developments related to new or existing environmental matters or changes in environmental laws or policies could lead to material costs for environmental compliance or cleanup 
there can be no assurance that these liabilities and costs will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position in the future 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
numerous claims  complaints and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business  including but not limited to those relating to environmental matters  competitive issues  contract issues  intellectual property matters  personal injury and product liability claims  and workers compensation have been filed or are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries 
additionally  we may become subject to significant claims of which we are currently unaware or the claims that we are unaware of may result in our incurring a significantly greater liability than we anticipate 
this may also be true in connection with past or future acquisitions 
while we maintain property  cargo  auto  product  general liability  and directors and officers liability insurance and have acquired rights under similar policies in connection with these acquisitions which we believe cover a portion of these claims  this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 
in addition  we have been increasing our self insurance limits over the past several years 
while we believe we are entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims  these rights may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 
in our opinion  these matters are either without merit or are of a kind that should not have a material adverse effect individually and in the aggregate on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
however  we cannot assure you that recoveries from insurance or indemnification claims will be available or that any of these claims or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
it is our policy to comply fully with applicable environmental requirements 
we are currently involved in various investigatory and remedial actions at our facilities and at third party waste disposal sites 
an estimate of loss  including expenses  from legal actions or claims is accrued when events exist that make the loss or expenses probable and we can reasonably estimate them 
our environmental accruals cover anticipated costs  including investigation  remediation  and operation and maintenance of clean up sites 
our estimates are primarily based on investigations and remediation plans developed by independent consultants  regulatory agencies and potentially responsible third parties 
accordingly  our estimates may change based on future developments including new or changes in environmental laws or policies  a difference in costs required to complete anticipated actions from estimates provided  future findings of investigation or remediation actions  or alteration to the expected remediation plans 
it is our policy to realize a change in estimates once it becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
in determining our accruals  we do not discount environmental or other legal accruals and do not reduce them by anticipated insurance recoveries 
we do take into account third party indemnification from financially viable parties in determining our accruals where there is no dispute regarding the right to indemnification 
while we believe that our accruals related to environmental  litigation and claims are sufficient and that these items and our rights to available insurance and indemnity will be resolved without material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity  individually or in the aggregate  we cannot assure you that our accruals and right to indemnity and insurance will be sufficient or that these items will be resolved without a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity  individually or in the aggregate 
our inrange subsidiary is subject to various risks and any material adverse effect on inrange could materially adversely affect our financial results 
at december   we owned approximately of the total number of outstanding shares of common stock of inrange technologies corporation 
based on the closing price of inrange s class b common stock on december   inrange s market capitalization was approximately  which is a significant decline from its market high 
our investment in inrange may be subject to significant future volatility 
inrange is a high technology company that designs  manufactures  markets and services switching and networking products for storage and data networks  and is subject to additional and different risks than we are 
inrange s public equity trades similarly to that of other technology companies 
the economic downturn in and has adversely affected the market in which inrange sells its products and has caused industry pricing pressures 
any adverse effect on inrange may adversely affect us 
in addition to the risks described in this report for our business as a whole  inrange is subject to the following risks inrange s business will suffer if it fails to develop  successfully introduce and sell new and enhanced high quality  technologically advanced cost effective products that meet the changing needs of its customers on a timely basis 
inrange s competitors may develop new and more advanced products 
inrange relies on sole sources of supply for some key components in its products and relies on indirect channels to sell one of its key products 
any disruption in these supply or distribution relationships could affect inrange s revenues and earnings significantly 
the price for inrange s products may decrease in response to competitive pricing pressures  maturing life cycles  new product introductions and other factors 
accordingly  inrange s profitability may decline unless it can reduce its production and sales costs or develop new higher margin products 
competition in network markets may lead to reduced sales of inrange s products  reduced profits and reduced market share 
inrange s primary competitors in the fibre channel switch market are brocade communications and mcdata  both of which currently sell more fibre channel switches than inrange does 
the perception by some that these companies are early leaders in the storage area network market may materially adversely affect inrange s ability to develop new customer relationships 
other companies including cisco are providing or will be introducing fibre channel switches and other products in inrange s markets  and their products could become more widely accepted than inrange s 
the foregoing is a summary of the risk factors applicable to inrange 
for a more complete description of those risks  please see factors that may affect future results in inrange s annual report of form k for the fiscal year ended december   which is hereby incorporated by reference in this report 
inrange is also an unrestricted subsidiary under our senior notes and not subject to covenants under the indenture governing our senior notes 
we are subject to work stoppages  union negotiations  labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force  which may adversely impact our profitability and cause us to incur incremental costs 
as of december   we had approximately  employees 
approximately  of our employees are represented by over seventeen domestic  collective bargaining units and various foreign collective labor arrangements 
while we generally have experienced satisfactory relations at our various locations  we are subject to work stoppages  local  regional and national union negotiations and potential labor disputes 
further  we may be subject to work stoppages  which are beyond our control at our suppliers or customers 
on july   a labor contract involving hourly employees at our manufacturer of aerospace components expired without resolution  resulting in an employee strike 
the labor contract dispute affected employees 
in  we recorded of incremental security and consulting costs associated with the labor contract dispute 
on march   the union employees voted to ratify a new contract  which brings closure to this labor dispute 
difficulties presented by international economic  political  legal  accounting and business factors could negatively affect our interests and business effort 
in  approximately of our sales were international  including export sales 
in addition  in  approximately of inrange s sales were international  including export sales 
we are seeking to increase our sales outside the united states 
our international operations require us to comply with the legal requirements of foreign jurisdictions and expose us to the political consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions 
our foreign business operations also are subject to the following risks difficulty in managing  operating and marketing our international operations because of distance  as well as language and cultural differences  increased strength of the us dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in us dollars  which may have a material adverse effect on sales or require us to lower our prices and also decrease our reported revenues or margins in respect of sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent we are unable or determine not to increase local currency prices  likewise  decreased strength of the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased overseas  difficulty entering new international markets due to greater regulatory barriers than the united states and differing political systems  increased costs due to domestic and foreign customs and tariffs  potentially adverse tax consequences  including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  and transportation and shipping expenses  credit risk or financial condition of local customers and distributors  potential difficulties in staffing and labor disputes  risk of nationalization of private enterprises  government embargos or foreign trade restrictions such as anti dumping duties  increased costs of transportation or shipping  environmental laws and regulations  ability to obtain supplies from foreign vendors and ship products internationally during times of crisis or otherwise  potential difficulties in protecting intellectual property  increased worldwide hostilities including  but not limited to  possible military action in iraq  potential imposition of restrictions on investments  and local political  economic and social conditions  including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions and political instability in certain countries 
as we continue to expand our international operations  these and other risks associated with international operations are likely to increase 
in addition  as we enter new geographic markets  we may encounter significant competition from the primary participants in those markets who may have significantly greater market knowledge and substantially greater resources than we do 
arthur andersen llp  the independent public accountant that audited our and annual consolidated financial statements  has not consented to our use or incorporation by reference of its audit opinion and has been convicted of obstruction of justice  which may adversely affect the ability of arthur andersen llp to satisfy any claims that may arise out of its audits of our consolidated financial statements 
arthur andersen llp is the independent public accountant that audited our consolidated financial statements through december  and for each of the three years in the period ended december  arthur andersen llp was convicted in june of obstruction of justice in connection with the us government s investigation of enron corp 
events arising out of this conviction most likely will adversely affect the ability of arthur andersen llp to satisfy any claims that may arise out of arthur andersen llp s audits of our consolidated financial statements 
additionally  because the personnel responsible for the audits of our consolidated financial statements are no longer employed by arthur andersen llp  we have not received arthur andersen llp s consent with respect to the use of those consolidated financial statements and the related audit report  accordingly  if those consolidated financial statements are inaccurate  your ability to make a claim against arthur andersen llp may be limited or prohibited 
until our consolidated audited financial statements for the fiscal year ending december  become available in the first quarter of  the sec s current rules require us to present or incorporate by reference our audited financial statements for the periods that these financial statements were audited by arthur andersen llp 
while the sec has indicated that in the interim it will continue to accept financial statements audited by arthur andersen llp  there is no assurance that the sec will continue to do so in the future 
if the sec declines to accept financial statements audited by arthur andersen llp prior to the filing of our form k for the year ending december   it could impede our access to the capital markets unless deloitte touche llp  our current independent auditor  is able to audit the consolidated financial statements originally audited by arthur andersen llp 
additionally  if our financial statements for the two years ended december  are subject to a material modification or change for any reason  the sec would likely require these periods to be re audited by our current independent auditor 
future increases in the number of shares of our outstanding common stock could adversely affect our common stock price or dilute our earnings per share 
sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock into the public market  or the perception that these sales could occur  could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
if certain conditions are met  the lyons could be converted into shares of our common stock 
the shares are covered by the february lyons and the may lyons have been registered under the securities act 
subject to adjustment  the lyons could be converted into an aggregate of shares of common stock 
in addition  as of december   approximately shares of our common stock are issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options by employees and non employee directors 
additionally  we may issue a significant number of additional shares in connection with our acquisitions 
we also have a shelf registration statements for shares of common stock that may be issued in acquisitions and we also have filed a shelf registration statement for a total of  of which has been used for the offering of our senior notes and the remainder of which may be used in connection with an offering of debt securities and or common stock for general corporate purposes 
any such additional shares also could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share 
provisions in our corporate documents and delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company  and  accordingly  we may not consummate a transaction that our stockholders consider favorable 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws may inhibit changes in our control not approved by our board 
these provisions include  for example  a staggered board of directors  a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent  a requirement that special stockholder meetings be called only by our chairman  president and chief executive officer or our board  advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations  limitations on stockholders ability to amend  alter or repeal the by laws  enhanced voting requirements for certain business combinations involving substantial stockholders  the authority of our board to issue  without stockholder approval  preferred stock with terms determined in its discretion  and limitations on stockholders ability to remove directors 
we also have a shareholder rights plan designed to make it more costly and thus more difficult to gain control of us without the consent of our board 
in addition  we are afforded the protections of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could have similar effects 
in general  section prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder each as defined in section for at least three years after the time the person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met 
our technology is important to our success 
because many of our products rely on proprietary technology  we believe that the development and protection of our intellectual property rights is critical to the success of our business 
in order to maintain our market positions  we need to continually develop and introduce high quality  technologically advanced and cost effective products on a timely basis 
the failure to do so could result in a significant competitive disadvantage 
additionally  despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  and we selectively use financial instruments to manage these risks 
we do not enter into financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we have interest rate protection agreements with financial institutions to limit exposure to interest rate volatility 
our currency exposures vary  but are primarily concentrated in the euro  canadian dollar  and british pound 
translation exposures generally are not specifically hedged 
the following table provides information  as of december   about our outstanding debt obligations and presents principal cash flows  weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates and fair values 
the weighted average interest of our variable rate obligations is at december  expected maturity date after total fair value fixed rate debt average interest rate lyons  fully accreted average interest rate senior notes average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate there are various factors that a lyon holder would use in deciding to exercise their put option 
these factors include the price and volatility of our common stock  the interest yield on the lyons above the risk free interest rate and other quantitative and qualitative factors 
based upon these factors  at the time of the filing of this form k  we believe that it is probable  but cannot determine with certainty  that the holders of the may lyons will exercise their put right and require us to repurchase the majority or all of their lyons on may  if all the may lyons were settled in cash on may   we would be required to pay the holders approximately accordingly  the accreted value of the may lyons at december   has been classified as current in our consolidated balance sheet at december  as of december   we had outstanding swaps that effectively converted  of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate of approximately 
these swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges and expire at various dates  with the longest expiring in november we believe that current cash and equivalents  cash flows from operations and our unused revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund working capital needs  planned capital expenditures  other operational cash requirements  and required debt service obligations 
in addition  we have the ability and may elect to refinance the lyons  if put  with other debt
