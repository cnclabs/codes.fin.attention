item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
general we were formed as a delaware limited liability company on december   and organized and began operations on january  inception date 
we were converted into a delaware corporation on april  when all of the outstanding equity interests of the limited liability company were converted into shares of common stock of the corporation 
unless otherwise indicated  all information that we present in this form k for any date or period gives effect to the conversion as if it had occurred on that date or as of the beginning of that period and all references to common stock for periods before the conversion mean our issued and outstanding membership interests 
overview we have developed a patent pending process called hydrogen on demand tm that safely generates pure hydrogen or electricity from environmentally friendly raw materials 
in the process  the energy potential of hydrogen is carried in the chemical bonds of sodium borohydride  which in the presence of a catalyst releases hydrogen or produces electricity 
the primary input components of the reaction are water and sodium borohydride  a derivative of borax  which is found in substantial natural reserves globally 
hydrogen from this system can be used to power fuel cells  as well as fed directly to internal combustion engines 
we also have patents covering boron based longer life batteries 
our goal is to convert our technology from the research and development stage to commercialization 
our losses have resulted primarily from costs associated with product development and research and development activities as well as non cash amortization of preferred stock and non cash charges related to the issuance of stock options and warrants to employees and third parties 
as a result of planned expenditures in the areas of research  product development and marketing and additional non cash charges relating to employee stock options  we expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future 
results of operations year ended december  versus revenues 
we recorded  of revenues during the year ended december  the revenues were attributable to sales of prototype hydrogen on demand tm systems and design and engineering services 
there were no revenues in in the near term  revenues are expected to be derived substantially from up front license fees  research contracts with various federal  state and local agencies  collaborations with other companies  management services  and royalty payments or joint venture revenue from licensees or strategic partnerships 
revenues will be recognized in the period in which technology is delivered  licensing revenues are earned  or as services are performed 
cost of revenues 
we recorded cost of revenues of  during the year ended december  cost of revenues on prototype unit sales during the development stage are allocated from the product development and marketing expense and research and development expense line items on the income statement depending on the nature of the project 
there was no cost of revenues in the year ended december  product development and marketing expense 
product development and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  this increase is mostly attributable to increased business development resources dedicated to penetrating markets in the portable power and military applications in addition to spending on programs that support our technology s continued evolution from research to commercialization 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease was a result of increased efficiency of our administrative and finance organizations as well as the impact of headcount reductions in those organizations during the second quarter of restructuring expense 
restructuring expense was  for the year ended december  during the second quarter of  the company incurred and paid restructuring expenses for severance and legal costs related to employee separations 
there was no restructuring expense in non cash charges 
non cash charges were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease was mostly attributable to the substantial completion of vesting in of warrants issued to affiliates during and the forfeiture of certain unvested employee options during the fourth quarter of included in the charges was an accrual for approximately  for board of directors compensation for meetings held in that will be paid to the directors in shares of the company s common stock in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  this increase reflects depreciation on our newly completed lab and facilities expansion program in research and development expense 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease is primarily attributable to the cost reduction efforts announced in may other income 
other income was  for the year ended december  this income was derived from the company s participation in the new jersey emerging technology and biotechnology financial assistance program 
this program allows certain companies to transfer new jersey net operating losses to other companies 
this program  if continued by the state in future years  may produce similar cash inflows for the company each year 
interest income  net 
net interest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease in net interest income was the result of declining average cash balances and interest rate decreases from to in addition to interest expense and amortization of discount incurred on the million unsecured debentures issued in december the total interest expense incurred for the year ended december  for the million unsecured debentures was  interest expense will increase substantially in for interest payments and amortization of discounts recorded upon issuance of an additional million secured debentures  which were issued in january and for the full impact of the million unsecured debentures which mature in june to the extent the unsecured debentures are converted into common shares  the pro rata portion of the discount and charges related to the beneficial conversion features will be recorded as interest expense 
total interest expense of approximately million will be incurred prior to june  for the amortization of the original issue discount  other issue costs and cash interest payments on the million unsecured debentures 
as the timing of conversions will be based on stock market conditions and operating cash needs  it is difficult to predict the amount of the interest expense that will be recorded in for the million secured debentures that were issued in the first quarter of equity in losses of affiliate 
in july  the company agreed to acquire a interest in a european alkaline fuel cell company the affiliate 
the company s investment is accounted for by the equity method 
according to the purchase agreement  the company was responsible to record its portion of the affiliate s losses from july  through december  the losses recorded by the company during this period were  year ended december  versus total revenues 
during and  we did not recognize any revenues related to the sale or license of our technology 
product development and marketing expense 
product development and marketing expenses were  for the year ended december  these expenses include business development and marketing activities and efforts to customize our technology in accordance with agreements with partners as well as for general business development 
we did not incur product development and marketing expenses in the year ended december  general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  in  an increase of  this was due largely to the full year impact of our financial  administrative and investor relation organizations including salary and related benefits costs established during the latter half of occupancy costs also increased as we tripled the size of our facilities in non cash charges 
non cash charges were  for the year ended december  compared to  in  a decrease of  non cash charges recorded in were related to continuing amortization of below market options granted to employees and non employee board members in of  and the fair value of warrants issued to affiliates in of  non cash charges for the year ended december  included a non cash compensation charge of  for the grant of company stock options to employees and non employee board members below market  the fair value of warrants issued to affiliates of  and  for the issuance of common stock in connection with the termination of the royalty agreement 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization was  for the year ended december  compared to  in  an increase of  this increase in depreciation and amortization is related to the addition of certain laboratory equipment and leasehold improvements in our newly expanded facilities 
research and development expense 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  in  an increase of  the increase is primarily attributable to increased staffing and research projects as required to further the development of our technology 
interest income 
net interest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  in  an increase of  the increase in interest income is primarily the result of higher average balances in resulting from the proceeds of the initial public offering in august coupled with our long term investment strategy established in january preferred stock amortization 
preferred stock amortization of  for the year ended december  represents a non cash charge to the common stockholders in connection with the may issuance of the preferred stock at less than the initial public offering price  which was converted into common stock in august liquidity and capital resources general since the inception date  we have financed our operations primarily through our initial public offering in august and private placements of equity and debt securities 
in  we issued  of membership interests in millennium cell llc for cash  which subsequently were converted into our common stock as of april  we also received a capital contribution of  in the first quarter of  and in may  we sold  shares of series a preferred stock  which automatically converted into  shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial public offering 
the net proceeds from our initial public offering totaled approximately million and the net proceeds from the private placement and debt securities totaled million as of december  ballard power systems in october  we received million in cash from ballard power systems inc as an advance for prospective royalties pursuant to a product development agreement between ballard and us 
in addition  we granted to ballard a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  which was terminated as part of the strategic investment discussed below 
upon completion of certain stages of product development  the parties agreed to negotiate in good faith for the grant of a license of our technology to ballard in certain fields of use  at which time prepaid royalties may be earned and the warrants will be issued and recorded at fair value 
on november   we agreed with ballard that the product development milestones have been achieved and agreed to convert the million refundable royalty payment into an investment in our company in the form of secured convertible debentures due november  the ballard debentures are secured by a standby letter of credit issued by wachovia bank  national association  with an aggregate face amount equal to the outstanding principal 
we pledged to the bank as collateral million of funds previously reported under cash and cash equivalents on the accompanying balance sheet 
we will not have the ability to use this cash until the bank pledges are released upon conversion of the ballard debentures to common stock 
the debentures are convertible at a conversion price of  subject to anti dilution adjustments and certain price protection in the event the company initiates the conversion 
as part of the purchase agreement entered into between ballard and us  ballard retains the option to license the non exclusive right to manufacture and sell products with our hydrogen on demand tm technology for specific portable fuel cell products and stationary internal combustion engine generators 
private placement transactions on june   the company entered into a private placement financing transaction with two institutional and accredited investors pursuant to the terms of a securities purchase agreement among the company and the purchasers 
the private placement was exempt from registration under the securities act of  as amended  pursuant to section of such act 
the placement consisted of the sale of  shares of common stock for gross proceeds of million and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share 
pursuant to the terms of the june  purchase agreement  one of the investors was obligated to acquire million in secured convertible debentures  convertible into common stock of the company  subject to certain terms and conditions  and related warrants 
subsequent to this transaction  the company and the investor agreed the debentures would not be issued under the june  purchase agreement 
accordingly  the company withdrew its request for registration on form s with the sec for the common stock underlying the debentures and related warrants 
on october   the company entered into a separate private placement financing transaction with the same two institutional and accredited investors pursuant to the terms of a new purchase agreement among the company and the purchasers 
the private placement was exempt from registration under the securities act of  as amended  pursuant to section of such act 
the placement consisted of the sale of  shares of common stock and warrants with an exercise price of to purchase  shares of common stock of the company for gross proceeds of million 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  one of the investors agreed to acquire million of secured and unsecured debentures  convertible into common stock of the company  subject to certain terms and conditions  and warrants 
convertible unsecured debentures with a principal amount of million and warrants to acquire  shares with an exercise price of per share were issued on december  following effectiveness of the registration statement relating to the underlying shares of common stock 
interest accrues at a rate of per annum with payments due quarterly 
the unsecured debentures are due june   subject to six thirty day extensions  subject to the mutual consent of the company and the investor 
on january   the company s shareholders approved the issuance of million of secured debentures and warrants to acquire  shares at a special meeting of shareholders and the secured debentures were issued on january  interest accrues at money market rates with payments due quarterly 
the secured debentures are secured by a standby letter of credit issued by wachovia bank  national association  with an aggregate face amount equal to the outstanding principal of the secured debentures and are due in january the company pledged to the bank as collateral the proceeds from the sale of the secured debentures 
therefore  the company does not have the ability to use the proceeds from the sale of the secured debentures until the bank pledges are released upon conversion to unsecured debentures 
the company is obligated in the future to register the resale of shares issuable on conversion of the million principal amount of secured debentures following exchange of such secured debentures for unsecured debentures 
each time the principal amount of outstanding unsecured debentures is less than million  a portion of the million of secured debentures will automatically convert into unsecured debentures in increments of million  million and million upon effectiveness of the registration statement relating to the underlying shares of common stock 
the following table summarizes the number of common shares that have been registered by the company for potential resale in conjunction with i the sale of shares by the company to private accredited investors in june and october  ii shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants and iii shares issuable upon conversion of million principal amount of outstanding unsecured debentures

the unsecured convertible debentures in principal amount of million are convertible under three different scenarios at the option of the holder  at any time and from time to time at per share 
at the option of the company  if the average closing prices of the company s common stock during any consecutive trading days is equal to or greater than per share and the closing price for each of trading days which need not be consecutive is equal to or greater than the company may also convert  or up to million with investor consent of unsecured debentures each trading days at an adjusted conversion price equal to the volume weighted average of current market prices discounted from to 
the discount to the adjusted conversion price depends on the cumulative amount of debentures converted as of the respective dates of conversion 
the secured convertible debentures in principal amount of million are convertible at the option of the holder  at any time and from time to time at per share 
following exchange of secured debentures for unsecured debentures  the debentures so exchanged are convertible at the option of the company under the two circumstances set forth above 
in order to exercise the company s options to convert the debentures certain equity conditions must be satisfied as follows i the number of authorized but unissued and otherwise unreserved shares of common stock is sufficient for such issuance  ii such shares of common stock are registered for resale pursuant to an effective registration statement  and the prospectus thereunder is available for use to sell such shares or all such shares may be sold without volume restrictions pursuant to rule k under the securities act  iii the common stock is listed or quoted and is not suspended from trading on the nasdaq national market or smallcap market or other eligible market and such shares of common stock are approved for listing  iv no event of default nor any event that with the passage of time and without being cured would constitute an event of default has occurred and not been cured  and v no public announcement of a pending or proposed change of control transaction has occurred that has not been consummated 
warrants may not be exercised and debentures may not be converted to the extent that a holder thereof would then beneficially own  together with its affiliates  more than of our common stock then outstanding subsequent to the applicable conversion or exercise 
in accordance with apb no 
 accounting for convertible debt and debt issued with stock purchase warrants  the company determined that the relative fair value of the unsecured debentures was  after issuance 
the resulting discount of  is being amortized as interest expense  using the effective interest method  over the original maturity period of six months 
during the year ended december   the company recognized a non cash charge to interest expense of  for the amortization of the discount 
to the extent conversions of unsecured debentures into common stock are made prior to the maturity date of the debentures  the company will record as interest expense a ratable proportion of the discount associated with the face value of the debentures converted

 and eitf no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios eitf no 
 and after considering the terms of the transaction  the company determined that the unsecured debentures contained an initial beneficial conversion feature bcf 
the bcf existed because of a discount that will be given to the investor in the event of a company initiated conversion of the unsecured debentures prior to maturity 
these discounts will range from to  depending on the amount of debentures converted into common stock 
accordingly  at time of conversion  the company will record as interest expense any applicable bcf based on the fair value of the conversion feature on that date in the event of an early conversion of the unsecured debentures into common stock 
as no unsecured debentures were converted as of december   no interest expense was recorded for bcf during that period 
the secured debentures will have similar features 
sources and uses of cash as of december   we had  in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of  cash used in operations totaled   and  in  and  respectively  and related to funding our net operating losses 
the restricted cash comprised million of cash used for collateral in connection with ballard s strategic investment in the company and million of cash used for collateral as security deposit held by our landlord in connection with the company s amended lease agreement 
these funds used will not be available for use in operations until the letters of credit have been reduced or terminated 
investing activities provided used cash of   and  in  and  respectively 
investing activities consisted primarily of purchases and maturities of investments in high grade government bonds and bank certificates of deposit  purchases of laboratory equipment necessary for the continuation of our research and development activities  cash restricted as collateral  and patent registration costs 
we expect capital expenditures to decrease substantially as the company completed its facilities and lab expansion in we will continue to register  pursue and defend patents on our technology 
in july  the company agreed to acquire a interest in a european alkaline fuel cell company 
the company s investment is accounted for by the equity method 
according to the purchase agreement  the company was responsible to record its portion of the affiliate s losses from july  through december  the losses recorded by the company during this period were  the company s investment in the affiliate was  at december  and approximated the underlying fair value of our portion of the net assets of the affiliate at that date 
in april  the company amended its main operating lease to provide for additional space for the company s principal operating offices and laboratories 
as of november  we occupy all facilities contemplated in the lease agreement 
the amended lease will expire in and will contain options to renew for an additional years and will require the company to pay its allocated share of taxes and operating cost in addition to the annual base rent payment 
future minimum annual lease commitments including allocated taxes and maintenance under the amended operating leases are as follows

rent expense under the operating lease was approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in connection with the amended lease agreement  the company issued a letter of credit to the landlord for  in lieu of a cash security deposit 
the letter of credit was collateralized with a portion of the company s cash and is classified as restricted cash 
the funds used for collateral will not be available for use in operations 
between january and april  we received an aggregate of  from a recoverable grant award from the state of new jersey commission on science and technology 
the funds were used to partially fund costs directly related to development of our fuel cell technology 
the recoverable grant is required to be repaid when we generate net income in a fiscal year 
the repayment obligation  which begins in june  ranges from to of net income over a ten year period and shall not exceed of the original grant 
we are obligated to repay the unpaid amount of the original grant at the end of the ten year period 
as of december   no repayments have been made 
in december  the company received net proceeds of  from the sale of new jersey net operating losses in conjunction with the new jersey emerging technology and biotechnology financial assistance program 
this program allows certain companies to apply to transfer new jersey net operating losses to other companies 
this program  if continued by the state in future years  may produce similar cash inflows for the company 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  together with cash available from the financings see footnote together with future conversions of the secured and unsecured debentures will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated cash needs of our operations into the latter half of if cash consumption is higher than anticipated  we may seek additional financing within this time frame 
we may raise additional funds through public or private financings  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot assure you that additional funding  if sought  will be available or will be on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 
critical accounting policies application of critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
in addition  our reported financial condition and results of operations could vary due to a change in the application of a particular accounting standard 
we regard an accounting estimate underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have had a material effect on the presentation of financial condition  changes in financial condition  or results of operations 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies  however  require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
our management has discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and we believe that our estimates relating to revenue recognition  convertible debt and stock options described below fit the definition of critical accounting estimates 
revenue recognition the company s near term revenues will be derived substantially from contracts that require the company to deliver hydrogen generation technology  management services  system design and prototype systems and licensing of technology for test and evaluation 
it is anticipated that revenues will be recognized in the period in which the technology is delivered or licensed revenue is earned 
convertible debt the company accounts for the issuance and conversion of convertible debt in accordance with apb no 
 accounting for convertible debt and debt issued with stock purchase warrants 
as a result  the company has and will record original issue discounts to the extent the fair value of the debt is below the face value of the instrument and amortize the discount over the life of the instrument 
to the extent conversions of debt into common stock are made prior to the maturity date of the instrument  the company will record as interest expense a ratable proportion of the discount associated with the face value of the debt converted 
the company accounts for issuances of convertible debt in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments eitf no 
 and eitf no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios eitf no 

as a result of certain conversion price discounts included within the company s outstanding debt instruments  the company will record interest expense resulting from beneficial conversion features as described under the caption liquidity and capital resources above 
stock options the company has recorded non cash charges in  and to the fair value of warrants issued to certain affiliates and third parties 
certain affiliates have the ability to earn new awards based on defined milestones and service periods 
the accounting methodology requires a re valuing of the related earned warrants at each reporting period using a black scholes pricing model 
due to this variable accounting methodology  it is difficult to predict the amount of additional non cash charges the company will incur related to these warrants 
the fair value of the company s options and warrants issued to affiliates was estimated at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
the company also records non cash charges for the difference between the grant price and market price on the date of grant related to certain stock options issued to employees and elected directors below market prices as defined by apb no 
the non cash charge is recognized ratably over the related vesting period of the respective option contracts 
the company also discloses pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share that is required by sfas no 
this information is required to be determined as if the company had accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method of that statement 
the fair value of options granted for the fiscal years ended december   and has been estimated at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility 
the company s options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
due to these highly subjective assumptions  the non cash charges incurred in  and for warrants issued to affiliates and the pro forma disclosures of net loss and loss per share for fiscal  and  are not likely to be representative of non cash charges and the pro forma effects on net loss and loss per share  respectively  in future years 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
fas amends fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  fas amends the disclosure requirements of fas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the provisions of fas are effective for financial statements for fiscal years and interim periods ending after december  the disclosure provisions of fas have been adopted by the company see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
fas did not require the company to change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
this standard nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
this standard is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  as all costs related to our may  restructuring activities were incurred as of june   we do not expect this to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  operating results or cash flows due to changes in us interest rates 
this exposure is directly related to our normal operating activities 
our cash and cash equivalents are invested with high quality issuers and are generally of a short term nature 
as a result  we do not believe that near term changes in interest rates will have a material effect on our future results of operations 
our systems ability to produce energy depends on the availability of sodium borohydride  which has a limited commercial use and is not manufactured in vast quantities 
there are currently only two major manufacturers of sodium borohydride and there can be no assurance that the high cost of this specialty chemical will be reduced 
once we commence full operations in the future  we may need to enter into long term supply contracts to protect against price increases of sodium borohydride 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into these agreements to protect against price increases 
investment considerations we have decided to make disclosures in accordance with item of sec regulation s k of important qualitative risk factors that should be considered along with those described in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission prior to making an investment in our common stock 
our business  the results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could be harmed by any of the following factors we are a development stage company  which has only been in business for a short time 
in addition  many aspects of our business plan rest on beliefs formed by our management and have not necessarily been supported by independent sources 
as a result  your basis for evaluating us is limited 
we have incurred substantial losses and expect losses for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we may not be able to achieve profitability  and even if we do become profitable  we may not be able to sustain profitability 
we expect our future operating results to vary significantly quarter to quarter  and increase the likelihood that we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors at any given time 
a substantial number of shares of common stock have been  and are expected in the near future to be  registered for resale in connection with the issuance of common stock to private investors and the issuance of our common stock after conversion of outstanding debentures and exercise of outstanding warrants 
resale of a significant number of shares into the public markets could depress the trading price of our common stock and make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell equity securities in the future 
our debentures are subject to a number of restrictive covenants  including a requirement that our common stock remain listed on a national exchange and requirements as to the trading prices of our common stock 
if we are unable to maintain a listing on either nasdaq national market or nasdaq smallcap market  the debentures may be called by the holders 
furthermore  if the nasdaq national market or smallcap listing is not maintained  shareholders might find it more difficult to liquidate their investment 
we have appealed a notice of delisting from the nasdaq national market 
if we are not successful in the appeal  the shares of our common stock will not be traded on the nasdaq national market but instead  if we meet the continued listing requirements of the nasdaq smallcap market  trading of our common stock would be conducted on the nasdaq smallcap market or other nationally recognized markets or the over the counter market on the so called pink sheets or  if available  nasd s electronic bulletin board 
we may be required to issue more shares of common stock to the holders of the debentures and the warrants as a result of the anti dilution provisions of the debentures and the warrants 
in addition  subject to the satisfaction of numerous conditions  we have the right to force conversion of the unsecured debentures at a discount to current market prices 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock could reduce the market price for our common stock and make it more difficult for stockholders to sell their shares 
the proceeds of the unsecured debentures and the secured debentures  when available to us  are expected to be used to fund our product development and commercialization plans 
access to the funds from the secured debentures is subject to numerous conditions and is dependent on consent of the holder to an accelerated conversion schedule 
we can provide no assurance that all the proceeds of the secured debentures will ultimately be available 
even if all the proceeds of the secured debentures are available to us  additional funding may nonetheless be necessary if budgeted expenses exceed expectations or revenues fall short of projections 
if we are able to raise additional capital  it may be on unacceptable terms to us  may dilute your ownership or may restrict our ability to run our business 
we may be subject to litigation if our common stock price is volatile  which may result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources and could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
we may be unable to complete development of commercially viable hydrogen generation systems 
any perceived problem while conducting demonstrations of our technology could hurt our reputation and the reputation of our products  which would impede the development of our business 
some of the raw materials that the hydrogen generation systems use are expensive and are not manufactured in large quantities 
therefore  the energy produced by our systems may cost more than energy provided through conventional and alternative systems 
accordingly  our systems may be less attractive to potential users 
if we cannot develop and demonstrate lower cost processes for the manufacture of sodium borohydride  our commercialization plans may be hindered 
a mass market for fuel cells  hydrogen generation systems or batteries may never develop or may take longer to develop than we anticipate 
we are heavily dependent on companies or governmental agencies that would include our hydrogen generation systems in their products and to develop the infrastructure required to use of our technologies in certain applications or markets 
failure to meet cost or performance goals with potential customers could delay or impede commercialization of our technology 
changes in environmental policies could result in automobile manufacturers abandoning their interest in fuel cell powered vehicles
