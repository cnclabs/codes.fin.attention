item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of results of operations and financial condition is based upon and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this filing 
our going concern uncertainty our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended march  were prepared on the assumption that we will continue as a going concern  which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business 
our independent auditors have issued a report dated june  stating that our recurring operating losses  negative cash flows  and liquidity deficit raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
investors in our securities should review carefully our financial statements and the report of our independent accountants thereon 
see liquidity and capital resources below for a description of our plans to mitigate the effect of our going concern uncertainty 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following significant accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and allowance for bad debt  accounting for income taxes  and impairment of long lived assets 
revenue recognition and allowance for bad debts currently  we derive our revenues from monthly recurring fees for colocation and exchange point services and some managed services 
we also receive income from non recurring installation  managed services and construction activities  primarily from technology construction work 
revenues from colocation  exchange point services and some managed services are billed monthly and recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
installation fees are generally billed in the period in which the installation is performed but deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the related contract 
managed services fees are billed and recognized in the period in which the services are provided 
construction activities are billed in accordance with contract terms  but revenues are recognized on the percentage of completion method 
revenue is recognized as service is provided when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from customers 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
as of march  and  our accounts receivable amounted to  and  respectively  and were net of allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately  and  respectively 
revenues from construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs for each contract 
this method is used because management considers cost incurred to be the best measure of progress on these contracts 
the duration of a construction contract generally exceeds one year 
billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are classified as other liabilities and represent billings in excess of revenues recognized 
construction contract expense costs include all direct material and labor costs and indirect costs related to contract performance such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs  bad debt and depreciation 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which losses are determined 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions can be reasonably estimated 
accordingly  it is possible that our current estimates relating to completion cost and profitability of our uncompleted contracts will vary from actual results 
excluding depreciation  profit margins construction contract revenue less construction contract expenses on construction contracts for the years ended march   and were   and  respectively 
we analyze current economic news and trends  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating revenue recognition and the adequacy of our allowance for bad debts 
accounting for income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we currently have provided for a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
based on the available objective evidence  management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable 
should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination is made 
impairment of long lived assets we account for impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which we adopted in fiscal this standard requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
such events and circumstances include  but are not limited to  prolonged industry downturns  significant decline in our market value and significant reductions in our projected cash flows 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including long term forecasts of the number of additional customer contracts  profit margins  terminal growth rates and discounted rates 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
prior to adoption of sfas no 
 we accounted for long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
as of march  and  our long lived assets  including property and equipment and identifiable intangible assets and goodwill  totaled  and  respectively 
for the years ended march   and  we recognized impairment charges amounting to   and  respectively 
results of operations overview for the year ended march   approximately of our total revenues were generated from data center operations 
the remainder was substantially related to technology construction work 
for the year ended march  approximately of total revenues were generated from data center operations  approximately was from real estate projects and technology construction work  and approximately was from property and construction management 
for the year ended march   approximately of total revenues were generated from data center operations  approximately was from real estate projects and technology construction work  and approximately was from property and construction management 
during the past three years  our results of operations have been significantly impacted by our shift in focus to the housing and management of internet infrastructure after the nap of the americas became operational in july the sale of our telecom facilities management operations in february  and our exit from non core real estate activities by march  non core real estate activities included real estate development  property management  financing and other ancillary businesses which complemented the development operations 
our real estate activities currently include technology infrastructure construction work and management of the property where the nap of the americas is located 
results of operations for the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  revenue 
total revenue decreased million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the decrease is due to a reduction in our development  management and construction contracts revenue of approximately million partially offset by an increase in data center revenue  including contract termination fee  of approximately million 
data center revenue increased million to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  revenues consisted of recurring revenues of million and million respectively  for the years ended march  and  primarily from charges for colocation  power  peering and some managed services 
non recurring revenues were million and  respectively  for the years ended march  and  primarily related to managed services and the recognized portion of deferred installation revenue 
installation fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
the increase in revenues was primarily the result of an increase in orders from existing customers and growth in our deployed customer base from customers as of march  to customers as of march  we anticipate an increase in revenues from colocation  power and peering and revenues from managed services as we add more customers to the nap of the americas  sell additional services to existing customers and introduce new products and services 
data center contract termination fee was million for the year ended march  and represents amounts received from two customers for the termination of their contracted services with the nap of the americas 
no fees were received during the year ended march  contract termination fees are recognized upon contract termination when there are no remaining contingencies or obligations on our part 
development  commission and construction fees decreased million  or  to  for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the decrease in development  commission and construction fees is primarily the result of our exiting of the underlying non core real estate activities 
we do not expect any significant amount of revenues from development  commission and construction fees 
management fees decreased million  or  to  for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the decrease is a result of our exiting the management of commercial and residential properties 
the only facility we currently manage is tecota  the property in which the nap of the americas is located 
we collect from tecota a monthly management fee of approximately  or of cash collected by tecota  whichever is greater 
during the fiscal year ended march   we managed approximately properties 
because we do not plan to manage properties other than tecota  we anticipate that management fees will not be a significant source of revenues in the future 
construction contract revenue decreased million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  during the year ended march  we completed eleven contracts and  as of march   had two construction contracts in process 
during the year ended march   we completed two contracts and  as of march   we had five construction contracts in process 
the decrease in revenues from construction contracts is due to a decrease in the average revenue per contract  which went from average revenue per contract of million in fiscal year to average revenue per contract of  in fiscal year due to our opportunistic approach to our construction business  we expect revenues from construction contracts to significantly fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we anticipate focusing our efforts on obtaining construction contracts for projects related to technology infrastructure 
data center operations expenses 
data center operations expenses remained constant at million for the years ended march  and data center operations consist mainly of rent  operations personnel  electricity  chilled water and security services 
with the exception of electricity and chilled water  the majority of these expenses are fixed in nature 
however  commencing in fiscal year  we anticipate that certain data center expenses  principally costs related to managed services  will increase as we provide additional services to existing customers and introduce into the market new products and services 
we also expect that our costs of electricity and chilled water costs will increase in the future as we add more customers to the nap of the americas 
the number of employees whose salaries are included in data center operations remained constant at during the years ended march  and contract construction expenses 
contract construction expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  this decrease is a result of the decrease in number of contracts and dollar amount of those projects as discussed above in revenues from construction contracts 
we do not currently anticipate losses on any of the individual contracts 
start up costs data centers 
there were no start up costs for the year ended march  start up costs for the year ended march  primarily relate to the nap of the americas in miami  florida  and were approximately million 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  professional service fees  rent and other general corporate expenses 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses is mainly due to decreases in rent of million and payroll of million 
carrying costs  including rent  for our corvin facility in santa clara  california for the year ended march  were reflected in the facility s impairment charge in the previous year 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we recognized as of march  an impairment charge of million  including million in expected lease carrying costs for the period of time until the facility could be sublet 
during the second quarter ended september   an additional  in expected lease carrying costs were recognized and included as part of impairment of long lived assets 
during the year ended march   the rent for the corvin facility for that year was included in general and administrative expenses 
the decrease in payroll is mainly attributable to staff reductions 
the number of employees whose salaries are included in general and administrative expenses decreased from for the year ended march  to for the year ended march  the remaining period over period decrease in general and administrative expenses is mainly attributable to a decrease in general corporate overhead resulting from our exit of non core real estate activities in the year ended march  sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the significant components of sales and marketing expenses are salaries  commissions  provision for bad debt expenses and marketing 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses was mainly attributable to an increase in investor relations expense of  and an increase in provision for bad debt expenses of approximately  we issued warrants valued at approximately  to a third party for investor relations services 
provision for bad debt expense consists of full provisions related to eight customers 
we have commenced legal action against many of these customers 
the number of employees whose salaries are included in sales and marketing expenses increased slightly from as of march  to as of march  depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  this decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was mainly due to the cessation of million in amortization of goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with current accounting standards and a decrease in depreciation of approximately million related to our colocation facility in santa clara  california and non core assets 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation of approximately million primarily from assets of the nap of the americas that were put in service during fiscal year and had a full year of depreciation in fiscal year impairment of long lived assets 
due principally to the decline and uncertainty of the telecommunications and internet infrastructure markets  we recognized the following impairment charges year ended march  asset facility in santa clara  california post shell goodwill tecota promote interest equipment as a result of impairment charges in the years ended march  and  the long lived assets described in the table above became fully impaired 
due to our unsuccessful efforts to lease space at our colocation facility in santa clara  california  during the quarter ended september   we granted an option to one of our vendors a contractor involved with the facility s build out to purchase the leasehold improvements and assume the existing lease for approximately million 
based on this option  we recorded a million impairment charge in the quarter ended september  to write the improvements down to the option amount 
subsequently  we continued to search for alternatives  which included subleasing or selling our leasehold improvements 
in the quarter ended march   upon expiration of the option  we listed our leasehold improvements for sale  indicating a definite change in the strategy 
we are now actively looking for a buyer to assume the existing lease or sublease all or a substantial portion of the space 
the existing lease is  per month  with scheduled annual increases  for a twenty year term ending in we believe that the most likely outcome is that the property will be subleased or leased from the landlord to a third party and that we will receive no consideration for the leasehold improvements 
based on this most likely scenario  in the quarter ended march   we recorded an additional million impairment  resulting in the asset being fully reserved 
we also established as of march  reserves for leasehold carrying costs  consisting primarily of monthly rent 
as of march   we had approximately million in related reserves which we anticipate will carry the facility through march the decline in the telecommunications industry and resulting decline in related real estate construction and leasing activities caused us to perform  during the years ended march  and  impairment analyses of our promote interests in tecota acquired in the telecom facilities management operations and the goodwill related to the post shell acquisition 
our analyses were based on estimated fair value determined by the discounted future expected cash flows method 
the analyses anticipated obtaining additional construction contracts for post shell and additional tenants for tecota 
we determined that the assets  which are included in our telecom facilities management and real estate services segments  were impaired as of march  by approximately million and million  respectively 
during the year ended march   no significant contracts were awarded to post shell and no tenants were added to tecota 
as a result  we impaired the remaining  in tecota promote interests and million in post shell goodwill 
during the fiscal year ended march   we wrote off  related to equipment that has been held for installation for more than one year and is considered obsolete 
on october   we entered into a joint venture agreement to develop and operate a hippa compliant network access point at the nap of the americas in miami  florida 
we acquired a interest in the joint venture company by issuing a million promissory note 
as the joint venture was not fully funded by december   we determined that our joint venture interest was impaired 
therefore  we recognized a million impairment as of december  effective march   we and the other joint venture partner entered into an agreement to declare void all the then current agreements and contracts  including the joint venture agreement 
as a result  we were no longer obligated under the promissory note 
the results of operations present  on a net basis  the effects of the formation and the dissolution of the joint venture and accordingly no gain or loss was recognized as a result of these transactions 
interest income 
interest income increased  or  to  for the year ended march  from  for the year ended march  the increase was due to the recording of interest income on a million note receivable from our chief executive officer which began accruing interest in september inducement on debt conversion 
during the year ended march   we incurred a non cash expense of million related to the million of our convertible debt that was converted into million shares of our common stock 
the debt was converted at per share  which was approximately below the stated conversion price 
this expense represents the fair value of the additional common shares issued by us as a result of the lower conversion price 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for year ended march  the increase was due to an increase of million in the average debt balance outstanding 
the increase was offset by the conversion of million in convertible debt during the quarter ended december  and reduction in the interest rate of the ocean bank loan from to 
based on the april  transactions  we expect cash interest payments to be reduced by approximately  for the year ended march  gain on the sale of real estate held for sale 
in july  we sold fortune house ii for million and recorded a gain of approximately million 
during the year ended march   we also sold six condominium units and recorded a net gain of million 
the last condominium unit was sold in the quarter ended march  net loss 
net loss decreased million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the net loss for the year ended march  is mainly due to non cash items  including impairment charges of long lived assets of approximately million and depreciation and amortization expense of approximately million  interest expense of approximately million  and approximately million of expenses generated from the operations of the nap of the americas 
results of operations for the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  revenue 
total revenue decreased million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march   reflecting our exit of the real estate development business 
data center revenue increased million to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the increase in data center revenue was attributable to our peering  colocation and managed services offered at the nap of the americas  which became operational in july the data center revenue in the prior year was derived from our peering and colocation services offered at the interim nap which became operational in december our deployed customer base increased from four as of march  to as of march  we expect data center revenues to increase in future periods as customers set up their operations in the nap of the americas 
future data center revenues will be derived from peering  colocation and managed services 
revenue from real estate sales was million for the year ended march  and was attributable to the sale of twelve condominium units 
we exited our real estate development business as of march  accordingly  the real estate sales during year ended march   consisting of six condominium units sold  were recorded net of their related cost and included in gain on the sale of real estate held for sale 
development  commission and construction fees decreased million to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  this decrease is primarily the result of our exiting the real estate development business and telecom facilities management operations as of march  management fees decreased million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the decrease is a result of our exiting the management of commercial and residential properties 
revenues from construction contracts decreased million  from million for the year ended march  to million for the year ended march  the decrease is attributable to the reduction in the number of contracts 
during the year ended march   we completed two contracts and  as of march   we had five construction contracts in process 
during the year ended march   we completed twelve contracts and  as of march   we had seven contracts in process 
data center operations expenses 
data center operations expenses increased million to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the increase was attributable to us moving to our permanent facilities  the nap of the americas  which became operational in july the data center operations expense in the prior year was derived from operations of the interim nap facility  which became operational in december data center operations consist mainly of rent  operations personnel  electricity  chilled water and security services 
with the exception of electricity and chilled water  the majority of these expenses are fixed in nature 
construction contract expenses 
contract construction expenses decreased million to million for year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the decrease is in line with the decrease in revenues from construction contracts 
construction contract expenses are primarily the result of the number of contracts in process  stage of completion and dollar amount of those projects 
start up costs data centers 
start up costs decreased million to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the decrease is mainly attributable to our permanent facilities  the nap of the americas  becoming operational in july start up costs in fiscal year also included costs of the interim nap facility 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million to million for the year ended march  from approximately million for the year ended march  the decrease is attributable to staff reductions and corporate infrastructure related to non core assets 
during fiscal year  our efforts included establishing internal operations to support our internet infrastructure services strategy 
the significant components of these expenses include personnel  insurance  office expenses and professional fees 
in addition  during the year ended march   we implemented several cost savings initiatives  including staff reductions and an overall decrease in discretionary spending 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the increase is principally due to million in marketing expenses for our terrenap data centers including nap of the americas  partially offset by a million decrease in marketing expenses associated with the sale of real estate 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the increase resulted primarily from the depreciation of the leasehold improvements and equipment used in the nap of the americas  which were placed in service on july  therefore  no similar expenses were recorded for the comparable period during impairment of long lived assets 
during the year ended march   in accordance with sfas no 
 we evaluated the carrying value of our leasehold improvements related to our colocation facility in santa clara and our goodwill related to post shell and our tecota promote interests 
our investment in our santa clara facility was impaired due to a decline in the technology sector and general economic conditions 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million 
in addition  changes in business conditions in the telecommunications industry and resulting decline in related construction projects caused us to record an impairment to post shell s goodwill of approximately million 
furthermore  the decline in real estate leasing activities caused us to record an impairment of million to the tecota promote interests 
as a result of our agreement to sell certain telecom facilities management operations  during the year ended march   we recognized a million impairment of intangible assets relating to management contracts sold 
interest income 
interest income decreased million to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  due to a decrease in our average cash balances invested and a decline in short term interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  due to an increase in our average debt balance outstanding 
gain on the sale of real estate held for sale 
during the year ended march   we sold fortune house ii for million and recorded a gain of million 
we also sold six condominium units and recorded a net gain of million 
net loss from continuing operations 
net loss from continuing operations increased million to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the increase was primarily due to non cash items  which include impairment of long lived assets of approximately million  and depreciation and amortization expense of approximately million 
also contributing to the loss were interest expense of approximately million and million of expenses generated from the start up and operations of the nap of the americas 
loss from discontinued operations and loss on disposition of discontinued operations 
in march  we implemented our plan to dispose of acquired businesses whose operations reflect internet faxing  unified messaging and telephony services 
these operations were acquired earlier in the year ended march  in association with the amtec  spectrum communication  ixs 
net and asia connect acquisitions 
since the operations represent a class of customer and a major line of business  the results of these activities and estimated loss on disposal are accounted for as discontinued operations 
the loss on disposition of discontinued operations of million includes write off of approximately million in goodwill 
for the year ended march   discontinued operations had million of total revenues and a loss of million  net of million in goodwill amortization 
for the year ended march   there were no losses from discontinued operations or loss on disposition of discontinued operations 
liquidity and capital resources recent events on april   ocean bank revised its million credit facility with us by converting million of the outstanding principal balance into equity and extending the term of the remaining million until april  concurrent with this transaction  we paid all past due interest as of march   plus accrued interest through april  totaling approximately million and prepaid approximately  of interest 
on april   crg llc completed the purchase  at a discount  of our million construction payables including accrued interest to cupertino electric  inc and kinetics mechanical services  inc 
and kinetics systems inc cupertino and kinetics were construction contractors for the nap of the americas 
at the closing  the construction payables were converted into  shares of our common stock 
on april   we issued subordinated secured convertible debentures due april  for an aggregate principal amount of million 
the debt is convertible into shares of our stock at per share 
interest is payable quarterly beginning july  the debentures were issued in exchange for million in cash  million in a promissory note due in full may  and million of notes payable which were converted into the subordinated debentures 
included in the million is million of cash received in march in anticipation of the transaction 
the maker of the million promissory note failed to pay but agreed on june  to assign the note and the debenture to an entity newly formed by the son of a director of the company 
payments received as of june  aggregated approximately million and the remaining million is due no later than august  two of the company s directors have guaranteed payment and performance in accordance with the amended terms of the note 
management believes that collection on the remaining balance is reasonably assured 
in connection with this transaction  the company will recognize a beneficial conversion feature of million  based on the june  measurement date 
the following condensed pro forma balance sheet gives effect to the following transactions as if they had occurred on march  ocean bank debt conversion of million in debt to equity  payment of million past due and accrued interest and million in prepaid interest to ocean bank  crg transaction whereby million in construction payables plus million in accrued interest was converted to equity  issuance of subordinated debentures for million in cash  million in conversion of notes payable and million in amounts receivables under the million promissory note

liquidity from the time of the merger through march   we have incurred net operating losses of approximately million 
our cash flows from operations for the years ended march  and were negative and our working capital deficit was approximately million and million as of march  and  respectively 
due to our recurring losses from operations  the uncertainty surrounding the anticipated increase in revenues and the lack of committed sources of additional debt or equity  substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern 
historically  we have met our liquidity needs primarily through obtaining additional debt financing and the issuance of equity interests 
some of our debt financing was either provided by or guaranteed by manuel d 
medina  our chief executive officer and chairman of the board 
in prior periods we also successfully shut down or disposed of non core operations and implemented a series of expense reductions to reduce our liquidity needs 
based on customer contracts signed as of june   our monthly cash deficit from operations is approximately million 
in order to eliminate this current monthly cash deficit from operations  the new monthly revenues required range from million to million 
this range of new revenue depends on the mix of the services sold and their corresponding margin 
our required revenues are based on existing contracts  including those recently announced with the us government and enterprises  and expected future contracts from potential customers currently in the sales pipeline 
we have identified additional potential customers  including the federal  state and local governments  and are actively offering available services to them 
however  our projected revenues and planned cash needs depend on several factors  some of which are beyond our control  including the rate at which our services are sold to the government sector and the commercial sector  the ability to retain our customer base  the willingness and timing of potential customers outsourcing the housing and management of their technology infrastructure to us  the reliability and cost effectiveness of our services and our ability to market our services 
the majority of our planned operating cash improvement is expected to come from an increase in revenues and cash collections from customers 
if we fail to achieve planned revenues we will require additional financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available  or that  if available the financing will be obtainable on terms acceptable to us or that any additional financing would not be substantially dilutive to existing shareholders 
if we need to obtain additional financing and fail to do so  it may have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet financial obligations and operate as a going concern 
consequently  the uncertainty surrounding the anticipated increase in revenues  including the rate at which services are sold  raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we will continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities  obtain credit facilities from lenders  or restructure our debt to further strengthen our financial condition or for strategic reasons 
sources and uses of cash cash used in operations for the year ended march  was approximately million compared to cash used in continuing operations of million for the year ended march   a decrease of million 
this period over period decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in our net loss to million in fiscal year when compared to million in fiscal year cash used in investing activities for the year ended march  was million compared to cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended march   a decrease of million 
the amount of cash used in investing activities has decreased as we have now completed the build out of the nap of the americas and a portion of our colocation facility in santa clara  california 
for the year ended march   cash of million was used primarily for the purchase of property and equipment related to the nap of the americas 
for the year ended march   cash of million was used primarily for the purchase of property and equipment related to the nap of the americas and our colocation facility in santa clara  california 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended march  was million compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended march   a decrease of million 
the period over period decrease in cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from a decrease of million of new borrowings partially offset by an increase in sale of common stock and warrants of million 
we had a net working capital deficit of approximately million and stockholder s deficit of approximately million at march  and incurred a net loss of approximately million for the year then ended 
this loss is principally the result of non cash items  including impairment charges of long lived assets of approximately million  and depreciation and amortization expense of approximately million  interest expense of approximately million  approximately million of expenses generated from the operations of the nap of the americas  and not generating sufficient revenue during the year to support the increase in infrastructure 
debt and equity activity ocean bank credit facility on september   we borrowed million from ocean bank 
the ocean bank credit facility is secured by all of our assets and allows for up to a million junior lien position on the assets of our nap of the americas  inc subsidiary 
to obtain the original loan  we paid a  commitment fee to ocean bank 
the proceeds of the original credit facility were used to repay a million short term loan from manuel d 
medina  our chief executive officer  the proceeds of which we had used to fund the build out of the nap of the americas mr 
medina  in turn  used the million to repay a personal million short term loan from ocean bank  repay million of debt that we owed to ocean bank under a line of credit personally guaranteed by mr 
medina  pay million in loan costs related to the million credit facility including a  commitment fee  and fund the nap of the americas build out costs 
mr 
medina has personally guaranteed the credit facility 
in addition to mr 
medina s personal guarantee of the credit facility  and in order to obtain the facility  the bank required mr 
medina  prior to the bank disbursing funds under the credit facility  to i provide million certificate of deposit to the bank as collateral on certain personal loans that mr 
medina has with the bank and ii commit to accelerate the maturity date of those personal loans to december  subsequent to september  mr 
medina and the bank changed the maturity date on the personal loans  first to december  and later to july  in the event of our default under the credit facility  mr 
medina also agreed to subordinate debt that we owed to mr 
medina 
mr 
medina has repaid part of those personal loans to the bank through liquidation of the million certificate of deposit in january leaving an outstanding principal balance of approximately million

medina becomes in default  we have a right of offset against all amounts payable by us to mr 
medina  the aggregate of which is approximately million as of march  subsequent to march   the amount was reduced to million 
mr 
medina agreed that we have the right to withhold payment to him of  in convertible debentures owned by him until the note receivable is repaid 
the note receivable from mr 
medina is shown as an adjustment to equity 
the million credit facility and the note receivable from mr 
medina were approved by our board of directors

medina modified the terms of his million non interest bearing note payable to us 
as amended  the note has a maturity date of december  and bears interest subsequent to september  at  the applicable federal rate 
interest is due in bi annual installments

there is no affiliation between crg and cupertino or kinetics 
crg is managed by mr 
altaba 
convertible debentures as of march   we had not paid approximately  of accrued interest on our convertible debt due on or before march  subsequent to march   we paid such amounts 
during november  we made an offer to all of the holders of the convertible debentures to convert their debentures  including accrued interest as of september   into our common shares at the lower of their current conversion price or 
approximately million of the convertible debentures had stated conversion prices in excess of per share 
as of december   approximately million of the convertible debt and accrued interest of approximately  was converted to equity 
as a result  we recognized million inducement on debt conversion expense which represents the fair value of the additional common shares issued as a result of the lower conversion price 
the holders of the convertible debt had a day period during january to require us to repay the outstanding principal balance 
during april and may  we made payments totaling approximately million to five holders of the convertible debentures who exercised their right to request an acceleration of payment 
other in august  we modified the terms of a note payable to a financial institution 
the maturity date was extended until december with some principal payments to be made monthly and the remaining principal and interest due at maturity

medina  our chief executive officer and  from guillermo amore  a member of our board of directors 
during the same period  we repaid million of short term debt  including  to mr 
medina   to mr 
amore and  to miguel rosenfeld  who is also a member of our board of directors

arturo ehrlich to assist us in raising capital

the construction of tecota was funded with million in equity and million in construction financing from a consortium of banks 
we guaranteed these construction loans during development and construction of tecota 
after tecota was built  some of the banks released us from the guarantee  the result of which was to reduce the guarantee to million

in addition  any statements that refer to expectations  projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward looking statements as a result of several factors more fully described in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report

we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
risk factors our recurring losses from operations and the lack of committed sources of additional debt or equity to support working capital deficits raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
from the time of the merger through march   we have incurred net operating losses of approximately million 
our cash flows from operations for the years ended march  and were negative and our working capital deficit was approximately million and million as of march  and  respectively 
the majority of our planned operating cash improvement during our fiscal year is expected to come from an increase in revenues and cash collections from customers 
if we fail to achieve planned revenues of million to million a month  then we will require additional financing 
there can be no assurances that additional financing will be available  or that  if available the financing will be obtainable on terms acceptable to us or that any additional financing would not be substantially dilutive to existing shareholders 
if we need to obtain additional financing and fail to do so  it may have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet financial obligations and operate as a going concern 
consequently  recurring losses from operations  the uncertainty surrounding the anticipated increase in revenues  including the rate at which services are sold and the lack of committed sources of additional debt or equity  raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and operate our business 
as of march   our total liabilities were approximately million  obligations guaranteed by us were million and our total shareholders deficit was million 
our substantial debt and guarantees could have important consequences to you  including the following our substantial leverage increases our vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions and could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that are less leveraged  our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and our industry and could limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities  borrow more money for operations or capital in the future and implement our business strategies  our level of debt may restrict us from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund working capital  capital expenditures  product development efforts  strategic acquisitions  investments and alliances  and other general corporate requirements  covenants in our debt instruments limit our ability to pay dividends or make other restricted payments and investments  and our total guarantees are approximately million and if we are required to fund under these guarantees our liquidity and cash flows would be adversely affected 
we may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repay or refinance our indebtness 
we are obligated to make principal and interest payments on our credit facility with ocean bank each year until it matures in additionally  million of our credit facilities mature in each of these obligations requires significant amounts of liquidity 
we may need additional capital to fund those obligations 
our ability to arrange financing and the cost of this financing will depend upon many factors  including general economic and capital markets conditions  and in particular the non investment grade debt market  conditions in the internet infrastructure market  credit availability from banks or other lenders  investor confidence in the telecommunications industry generally and our company specifically  and the success of our terrenap centers 
if we need additional funds  our inability to raise them will have an adverse effect on our operations 
if we decide to raise additional funds by incurring debt  we may become subject to additional or more restrictive financial covenants and ratios 
we are required to incur significant expenses in an effort to attract customers to our facilities 
our ability to generate increased revenue is substantially dependent on the willingness of potential customers to locate their critical operations at our facilities 
our ability to attract new customers depends on a variety of factors  including the willingness of carriers to exchange traffic at our facilities  the willingness of businesses to outsource their mission critical data operations  the reliability and cost effectiveness of our services and our ability to effectively market our services 
we expect to continue to make additional significant investments in sales and marketing 
the increase in our sales and marketing efforts may not result in increased sales of our services 
we intend to develop alternative distribution and lead generation relationships with potential channel partners 
any failure by us to develop these relationships could materially and adversely impact our ability to generate increased revenues 
if we do not locate financial or strategic partners  we may have to delay or abandon expansion plans 
expenditures commence well before a terrenap center opens  and it may take an extended period to approach break even capacity utilization 
it takes a significant period of time to select the appropriate location for a new terrenap center  construct the necessary facilities  install equipment and telecommunications infrastructure and hire operations and sales personnel 
as a result  we expect that individual terrenap centers will experience losses for more than one year from the time they are opened 
as a part of our terrenap center strategy  we intend to rely on third party financial or strategic partners to fund the development costs 
if we are unable to establish such third party relationships  we may delay or abandon some or all of our development and expansion plans or otherwise forego market opportunities  making it difficult for us to generate additional revenue and to respond to competitive pressures 
our operations in brazil and spain expose us to risks not faced by companies transacting business only in the united states 
we have operations in foreign countries  including nap facilities  sales personnel and customer support operations in sao paulo  brazil and madrid  spain 
we intend to expand to other international locations in the future 
these operations are subject to economic risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries  including the following disruptions in foreign markets 
disruptions in financial markets and the deterioration of the underlying economic conditions in some countries could have an impact on our sales to customers located in  or whose end user customers are located in  these countries 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
currency instability in geographic markets other than the united states may make our services more expensive than services offered by others that are priced in the local currency 
moreover  many of the costs associated with our operations located outside the united states are denominated in local currencies 
as a consequence  the increased strength of local currencies against the us dollar in countries where we have foreign operations would result in higher effective operating costs and  potentially  reduced earnings 
currently  we do not hedge our foreign exchange risk 
we cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will not have a negative effect on our operations and profitability 
longer payment cycles 
our customers outside of the united states are often allowed longer time periods for payment than our us customers 
this increases the risk of nonpayment due to the possibility that the financial condition of particular customers may worsen during the course of the payment period 
tariffs  duties  limitations on trade and price controls 
our international operations are affected by limitations on imports  currency exchange control regulations  transfer pricing regulations  price controls and other restraints on trade 
in addition  the governments of some countries in which we have operations  have the ability to exercise significant influence over many aspects of their domestic economies and international trade 
potential adverse tax consequences 
our international operations create a risk of potential adverse tax consequences  including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by our customers 
credit and access to capital risks 
our local financial or strategic partners could have reduced access to working capital due to higher interest rates  reduced bank lending resulting from contractions in the money supply or the deterioration in their financial condition  or the inability to access other financing 
distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries and affiliates may be subject to foreign taxes 
distributions of earnings and other payments  including interest  we receive from our subsidiaries and affiliates may be subject to withholding taxes imposed by the jurisdictions in which these entities are formed or operating 
these taxes would reduce the amount of after tax cash we would receive from these entities 
new competitors and competitive environment 
as we expand our operations in markets outside the united states  we will also encounter new competitors and competitive environments 
our foreign competitors may enjoy a government sponsored monopoly on telecommunications services essential to our business  and will generally have a better understanding of their local industry and longer working relationships with local infrastructure providers 
we may not be able to compete effectively in the market for data center services 
the market for data center services is extremely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
our current and potential competitors include providers of data center services  global  regional and local telecommunications companies and regional bell operating companies  and information technology outsourcing firms 
many of our existing competitors have greater market presence and financial and personnel resources than we do 
our competitors include internet data centers operated by established communications carriers such as at t  level  mci and qwest 
we also compete with providers of data services centers  regional bell operating companies that offer internet access and information technology outsourcing firms 
the principal competitive factors in our market include ability to deliver services when requested by the customer  internet system engineering and other professional services expertise  customer service  network capability  reliability  quality of service and scalability  variety of managed services offered  access to network resources  including circuits  equipment and interconnection capacity to other networks  broad geographic presence  price  ability to maintain and expand distribution channels  brand name recognition  timing of introductions of new services  physical and network security  financial resources  and customer base 
some of our competitors may be able to develop and expand their data center services faster  devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can 
in addition  these competitors have entered and will likely continue to enter into business relationships to provide additional services that compete with the services we provide 
our products and services have a long sales cycle that may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a customer s decision to purchase services at a terrenap center typically involves a significant commitment of resources and will be influenced by  among other things  the customer s confidence in our financial strength 
as a result  we have a long sales cycle 
delays due to the length of our sales cycle may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we believe our market is likely to consolidate in the near future  which could result in increased price and other competition 
some of our competitors who sell bandwidth may be able to provide customers with additional benefits relating to the customer s internet system and network management solutions  including reduced local and long distance communications costs  which could reduce the overall costs of their services relative to ours 
we may not be able to offset the effects of any price reductions 
we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our success 
we are highly dependent on the services of manuel d 
medina  our chairman 
in an attempt to reduce costs  we have eliminated some management positions 
our potential growth and expansion and the merger and integration of separate businesses  are expected to place increased demands on our management skills and resources 
therefore  our success also depends upon our ability to hire and retain additional skilled and experienced management personnel 
employment and retention of qualified personnel is important due to the competitive nature of our industry 
our president  chairman and chief executive officer  cannot be removed without cause which could delay  defer or prevent change in control of our company or impede a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business combination 
under the terms of our agreement with manuel d 
medina  our president  chairman and chief executive officer  as long as mr 
medina s guarantees of our debt exist  we have agreed to nominate mr 
medina to our board of directors and not remove mr 
medina  unless for good cause  or remove any of our officers without mr 
medina s consent 
this could delay  defer or prevent change in control of our company or impede a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business combination that you  as a stockholder  may otherwise view favorably 
if the price of our shares remains low or our financial condition deteriorates  we may be delisted by the american stock exchange 
our common stock currently trades on the american stock exchange amex 
the amex requires companies to fulfill specific requirements in order for their shares to continue to be listed 
our securities may be considered for delisting if i our financial condition and operating results appear to be unsatisfactory  ii it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the securities has become so reduced as to make further dealings on the amex inadvisable  or iii we have sustained losses which are so substantial in relation to our overall operations or our existing financial condition has become so impaired that it appears questionable whether we will be able to continue operations and or meet our obligations as they mature 
for example  the amex may consider suspension or delisting of a stock if the stock has been selling for a substantial period of time at a low price per share 
our common stock has been trading at relatively low prices for the past eighteen months and we have sustained net losses for the past three fiscal years 
therefore  our common stock is at risk of being delisted by the amex 
if our shares are delisted from the amex  our stockholders could find it difficult to sell our stock 
to date we have had no communication from the amex regarding delisting 
if our common stock is delisted from the amex  we may apply to have our shares quoted on nasdaq s bulletin board or in the pink sheets maintained by the national quotation bureau  inc the bulletin board and the pink sheets are generally considered to be less efficient markets than the amex 
in addition  if our shares are no longer listed on the amex or another national securities exchange in the united states  our shares may be subject to the penny stock regulations 
if our common stock were to become subject to the penny stock rules it is likely that the price of our common stock would decline and that our stockholders would find it difficult to sell their shares 
if our stock were to become delisted we could be in default of various agreements  including the ocean bank credit facility 
our business could be harmed by prolonged electrical power outages or shortages  or increased costs of energy 
our nap facilities are susceptible to regional costs of power  electrical power shortages and planned or unplanned power outages caused by these shortages 
a power shortage may result in an increase of the cost of energy  which we may not be able to pass on to our customers 
we attempt to limit exposure to system downtime by using backup generators and power supplies 
power outages  which last beyond our backup and alternative power arrangements  could harm our customers and our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not entered into any financial instruments for trading or hedging purposes 
our carrying values of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses is a reasonable approximation of their fair value 
our exposure to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt 
an immediate increase or decrease in current interest rates would furthermore not have a material impact on our debt obligations due to the fixed nature of our debt obligations 
the fair market value of our long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
these interest rate changes may affect the fair market value of the fixed interest rate debt but do not impact our earnings or cash flows 
to date  all of our recognized revenue has been denominated in us dollars  generated mostly from customers in the us  and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations has been minimal 
we expect that future revenues may be derived from operations outside of the us and may be denominated in foreign currency 
as a result  our operating results or cash flows may be impacted due to currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar 
furthermore  to the extent we engage in international sales that are denominated in us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our services less competitive in the international markets 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  and when appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we cannot assure you that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future 
some of our operating costs are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices 
the commodity most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of significant price change is electricity 
we are closely monitoring the cost of electricity 
to the extent that electricity costs continue to rise  we are investigating opportunities to pass these additional power costs onto our customers that utilize this power 
we do not employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge commodity price risk
