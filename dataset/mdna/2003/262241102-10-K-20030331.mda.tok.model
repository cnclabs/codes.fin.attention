strategic agreements rite aid rite aid and drugstore

in  of our net sales were generated through our agreement with rite aid 
if  for any reason  rite aid were unable to perform at its current levels  our future operating results could be materially impacted 
in accordance with our agreement with rite aid  we are obligated to purchase all of our pharmaceutical inventory from rite aid unless we are able to obtain better overall terms from another vendor 
currently  we purchase nearly all of our pharmaceutical inventory from rite aid  leveraging their volume requirements to obtain favorable pricing and credit terms 
thus far  we have not been able to obtain pricing on overall terms that are more favorable than those we are able to obtain through our rite aid relationship 
if rite aid were unable to supply our inventory  there are other suppliers in the marketplace that could provide us with the inventory we need 
if we were unable to obtain terms equivalent to the terms we are receiving through rite aid or if we were not able to make the transition to a new supplier in a timely manner  our operations could be adversely impacted either because we would not be able to process orders for pharmaceutical products  which would have a negative impact on the customer experience  or because our margins on pharmaceutical sales may decrease

the sec has defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the significant accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
we also have other key accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results
