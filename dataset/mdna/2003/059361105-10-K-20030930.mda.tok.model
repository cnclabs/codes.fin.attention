these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  and our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors set forth in risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we develop and publish interactive entertainment software products 
we currently publish titles for the most popular interactive entertainment hardware platforms  such as sony s playstation and playstation  nintendo s gamecube  nintendo  game boy color and game boy advance  microsoft s xbox  portable handheld devices manufactured by palm and handspring  and for personal computers or pcs 
we were incorporated in california in october under the name bay area multimedia  inc we reincorporated in delaware in september and changed our name to bam entertainment  inc in december we commenced operations in october and shipped our first products in june we license properties from a wide variety of sources  and publish titles based on the motion picture  sports and television properties of our licensors 
we have entered into strategic license arrangements with entertainment and media companies that have developed well known characters and brands and that are producing popular properties that are expected to form the basis of some of our future products 
our agreements with licensors and developers generally require us to make advance royalty payments  and we may be required to spend money on advertising and promotion 
we generally pay royalties based on net revenues 
we design and develop our titles through third parties with whom we have established relationships 
we believe that the development cycle for new titles is long  typically ranging from to months  except for nintendo s game boy advance for which the development cycle typically ranges from six to nine months 
after development of the initial product  we believe that it may take between six to additional months to develop the product for  or port the product to  a different hardware platform 
we have offices in both the united states and europe 
international operations outside of north america are conducted through our office in england  where we perform international sales and marketing activities and manage local third party developers 
domestically  we sell our products to mass merchandisers such as toys r us  target  kmart  wal mart and best buy  specialty chains such as gamestop and electronics boutique  and independent distributors 

table of contents internationally  in july we entered into a distribution agreement with acclaim entertainment ltd acclaim whereby acclaim will exclusively distribute certain forthcoming products of ours in pal territories 
pal is the television standard for the united kingdom  continental europe and australia 
prior to entering this agreement we sold our products internationally through mass merchandisers  distributors and sub distributors 
catalogue products will continue to be sold through mass merchandisers  distributors and sub distributors 
our products are manufactured exclusively by third parties 
we have experienced recurring net losses from inception october  through june  during the year ended june   we used cash in operating activities of million and incurred a net loss of million 
as of june   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and an accumulated deficit was million 
these factors  among others  raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of recorded liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern 
during the year ended june   we undertook measures to reduce spending and restructured our operations 
in february we retained  through july   the investment banking firm of gerard klauer mattison co  inc to assist us in reviewing a range of potential strategic alternatives  including mergers  acquisitions and additional financing 
no transactions arose from this assistance or were consummated during this period 
we may need to either consummate one or a combination of the potential strategic alternatives  or otherwise obtain capital via sale or license of certain of our assets  in order to satisfy our future liquidity requirements 
current market conditions present uncertainty as to our ability to effectuate any merger or acquisition or secure additional financing  as well as our ability to reach profitability 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to effectuate any such merger or acquisition or secure additional financing  or obtain favorable terms on such financing if it is available  or as to our ability to achieve positive cash flow from operations 
continued negative cash flows create significant uncertainty about our ability to implement our operating plan and we may have to further reduce the scope of our planned operations 
if cash and cash equivalents  together with cash generated from operations  are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we will not have sufficient resources to continue operations for the next six months 
as of june   we had million  million and  of capitalized development costs  current and long term prepaid royalties and licensed assets  respectively  related to software development projects in progress 
should we be unable to effectuate either a merger or acquisition or to secure sufficient additional financing  part or all of these development projects in progress might have to be abandoned and the related costs would have to be written off

net revenues net revenues were million  million and million for the years ended june    and  respectively 
revenues were lower in the year ended june  over the year ended june  because of fewer titles released and lower sales volumes 
revenues increased in the year ended june  over the year ended june  because we released more titles and sold increased volumes of product 
we released new products in the year ended june  compared to new products during the year ended june   and new products in the year ended june  to date  a substantial portion of our net revenues has been derived from sales of a limited number of products

in absolute dollars  cost of goods sold increased in the year ended june  over the year ended june  because of increased sale volumes of products 
the increase as a percentage of revenue in both years was due to a number of factors  including increased price protection and product returns reserved against sales  increased sales of surplus inventories at discounted prices  and lower introductory prices on certain titles 
royalties  software costs  and license costs were million  or of net revenues  for the year ended june   compared to million  or of net revenues  for the year ended june  and million  or of net revenues  for the year ended june  the increase in these costs in absolute dollars was because we launched more products for sophisticated hardware systems than in previous years  and expensed prepaid royalty costs where we considered future recoverability of such costs unlikely 
sophisticated hardware system products cost more to develop than products for handheld devices 
the increase in these costs as a percentage of revenues was due to the aforementioned factors  along with increased price protection and product returns reserved against sales

critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by us 
in addition  financial reporting release no 
also requires all companies to include a discussion addressing  among other things  liquidity  off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
use of estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition  adequacy of allowances for returns and price protection  doubtful accounts receivable  and cooperative advertising  carrying values of inventories  the future recoverability of prepaid royalties  capitalized software costs and licensed assets  and foreign currency translation 

table of contents net revenues we derive our revenues from shipment of finished products to our customers 
under certain conditions  we may allow customers to exchange and return our products and from time to time provide price protection or allow returns on certain unsold merchandise in the form of a credit against amounts due from the customer 
net revenues from product sales are reflected after deducting the estimated cost of allowances for returns and price protection as well as discounts given 
these estimates are based upon currently known circumstances and historical results 
the calculation of net revenues will be affected by many factors  including pricing strategies  the channels through which products are distributed  product maturity  exchange and return provisions and price protection 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition  and related interpretations  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price has been fixed or is determinable and collectibility has been reasonably assured 
our sales are typically made on credit  with terms that vary depending upon the customer and other factors 
if a sale is made on credit  and a significant portion of the fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are normally to days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable and will not recognize revenue until such time as the fee becomes due 
while we attempt to carefully monitor the creditworthiness of our customers and distributors  we bear the risk of their inability to pay our receivables and of any delay in payment 
if the collectibility of a receivable becomes uncertain after revenue has been recognized  we will record an allowance for doubtful accounts against our accounts receivable 
when we recognize revenue  we account for the estimate of future returns and price protection on the sale as allowances against receivables 
we also estimate cooperative marketing costs on the sale and account for these costs as a marketing expense and as an allowance against receivables 
we continually monitor  reassess and adjust the adequacy of all these allowances  along with the allowance for doubtful accounts  based on known circumstances  historical results  commitments made  anticipated events and anticipated commitments 
adjustments to these allowances will affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods the adjustments are made 
we expect that substantially all of our net revenues for a particular quarter will be generated by titles released in that quarter or in the immediately prior quarter 
the market for interactive entertainment software is characterized by short product life cycles  changing consumer preferences and frequent introduction of new products 
the life cycle of a title generally consists of a relatively high level of sales during the first few months after introduction  followed by a decline in sales  with only a small percentage of sales occurring more than six months after release 
we have experienced  and are likely to continue to experience  quarterly fluctuations in net revenues 
we believe the factors which influence these fluctuations include i the timing of our introduction of new products  ii the level of consumer acceptance of new and existing products  iii general economic and industry conditions that affect consumer spending and retail purchasing  iv the timing of the placement  cancellation or pickup of customer orders  v the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales  vi actions by competitors  vii location of product releases  and viii the number of titles released in the period and the hardware platforms on which they are released 
the timing of our introduction of new products is affected by uncertainties associated with software development  lengthy manufacturing lead times  production delays and the approval process for products by hardware manufacturers and other licensors 
the interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal  with net revenues typically significantly higher during the fourth and first calendar quarters  due primarily to the increased demand for titles during the year end holiday buying season 
a failure or inability to introduce products on a timely basis to meet seasonal increases in demand will harm our business and operating results 
due to these and other factors  the operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire fiscal year 

table of contents cost of revenues cost of revenues consists of cost of goods sold and royalties  software costs  license costs and project abandonment 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold includes manufacturing costs of finished goods  freight  inventory management costs and inventory obsolescence costs 
cost of goods sold will vary depending on the volume of products manufactured and shipped  the mix of products sold and the shipping channel used 
royalties  software costs  and license costs 
royalties  software costs  and license costs include royalties paid to software licensors  software amortization and amortization of non cash charges related to warrants and rights to acquire our common stock issued to certain production companies 
these costs will be affected in particular periods by many factors  including the specific terms or agreements under which royalties are paid to third parties  the commercial acceptance of products  the cost of developing a product and the timing of stock and warrants issued pursuant to the terms of our license agreements 
our agreements with licensors and developers generally require us to make advance royalty payments and pay royalties based on product sales  which may have guaranteed minimum payments 
prepaid royalties are amortized commencing upon the product release at the greater of the contractual royalty rate based on actual product sales  or the ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues 
we evaluate the future recoverability of prepaid royalties on a quarterly basis and expense costs if and when they are deemed unrecoverable 
we cannot assure you that the sales of products for which these royalties are paid or guaranteed payments are made will be sufficient to cover the amount of these required payments 
commencing upon product release  we amortize capitalized software development costs 
we capitalize software development costs subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a title 
technological feasibility is evaluated on a product by product basis 
for products where proven game engine technology exists  this may be early in the development cycle 
prior to establishing technological feasibility  software development costs are expensed to research and development  and to cost of revenues subsequent to establishing technological feasibility 
the following criteria are used to evaluate recoverability of software development costs historical performance of comparable products  the commercial acceptance of prior products released on a given hardware platform  orders for a product prior to its release and actual development costs of a product as compared to forward looking projections 
amortization of software development costs is based on the greater of the proportion of current revenues to total projected revenues or the straight line method over the estimated product life  generally three to six months 
we analyze our capitalized costs quarterly and take write offs when  based on our estimates  future individual product revenues will not be sufficient to recover our investment 
project abandonment costs 
if we terminate a development project prior to completion  we expense the capitalized software development costs and licensed assets costs to project abandonment 
research and development research and development expenses relate to the design and development of new interactive entertainment software products 
payments made to independent software developers under development agreements are capitalized to software development costs once technological feasibility is established or if the development costs have an alternative future use 
prior to establishing technological feasibility  software development costs are expensed to research and development and to cost of revenues subsequent to confirmation of technological feasibility 
internal development costs are capitalized to software development costs once technological feasibility is established 
technological feasibility is evaluated on a product by product basis 
for products where proven game engine technology exists  this may occur early in the development cycle 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from the adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
changes in interest rates and  in the future  changes in foreign currency exchange rates have and will have an impact on our results of operations 
interest rate fluctuations 
we do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be subject to interest rate risk due to the short maturities of the instruments in which we have invested 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on our product financing arrangement with a finance company 
we do not enter into derivative securities or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we estimate that a change in interest rates would have impacted our results of operations by less than  for the year ended june  foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
we face market risk to the extent that changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our non us dollar functional currency foreign operations 
the functional currency for our foreign operations is the applicable local foreign currency 
the translation of the applicable foreign currencies into us dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during the period 
the gains or losses resulting from such translation are reported as a separate component of equity as accumulated other comprehensive loss  whereas gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in results of operations 
we do not engage in hedging activities with respect to foreign exchange rate fluctuations
