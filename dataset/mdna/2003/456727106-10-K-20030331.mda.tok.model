effects of inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on the results of operations presented herein 
critical accounting policies the company has identified the policies below as critical to its business operations and to the understanding of its results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks on the company s results of operations related to these policies are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies 
the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates include  but are not limited to  revenue recognition  bad debt and sales return allowances  inventory obsolescence reserves  and the valuation of goodwill and other identified intangible assets 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition the company derives its revenues from the following sources ip management services revenues from patent annuity and trademark renewal payment services are recognized in the period when the related annuity tax payments are made to various regulatory agencies 
software license revenue the company recognizes revenue from software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
the company recognizes the revenue allocable to software licenses upon obtaining a signed license agreement and delivery of the software product unless the fee is not fixed and determinable or collectibility is not probable 
the company s current standard practice is not to provide customer acceptance terms in connection with licenses of its software 
however  certain agreements provide customer acceptance terms 
these customer acceptance terms  which the company considers to be perfunctory  lapse after a short period generally to days if the customer has not formally rejected the software 
arrangements that include acceptance terms beyond the company s standard terms are not recognized until acceptance has occurred 
in general  the company s sales of software licenses include an initial period of post contract customer support 
in addition  the company occasionally enters into service agreements related to software licenses 
in software arrangements that include rights to multiple software products  post contract support and other services  the company allocates the total arrangement fee among each deliverable based on the relative fair value of each of the deliverables 
the fair value of the software license is determined based on vendor specific objective evidence of the undelivered post contract customer support and service elements in accordance with the provisions of sop revenue from software licenses to parties other than end users  including reseller  third party integrator and oem arrangements with after sale support requirements  is recorded only when software has been placed with an end user and no further obligations exist 
publication revenue the company recognizes sales revenue when the risks of ownership have been transferred to the buyer  which is generally when shipped 
sales made on a returnable basis are recorded net of provisions for estimated returns and allowances 
subscription revenue revenue from subscriptions to the company s print publications and information services is recognized in income as earned over the subscription period 
costs in connection with the procurement of subscriptions are charged to expense as incurred 
certification test preparation software revenue revenue associated with the sale of certification test preparation software for it professionals can be deployed through cd rom or over the internet 
for cd rom sales  revenue is recognized upon shipment  for web based sales  revenue is recognized upon delivery of access code to customers 
support services revenue revenue is derived from i maintenance and post support contracts  ii training services and iii consulting services 
post contract customer support includes telephone support  bug fixes and rights to upgrades on a when and if available basis 
revenue from maintenance and post support contracts is recognized primarily over the term of the service contract 
revenue from training services is recognized upon completion of services 
consulting revenue includes implementation services performed primarily on a time and materials basis under separate service arrangements related to the installation of liquent software 
management does not consider the installation services essential because the services are routine in nature and include implementation planning  training of customer personnel  building simple interfaces and running test data 
also  customers have access to third parties who can provide such services 
the remainder of consulting revenues is derived primarily from project management for publishing new drug applications and general information technology consulting 
revenue is recognized for these services on a time and materials basis as services are performed 
in some circumstances  services are provided under fixed price arrangements  in which case revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method 
revisions in estimates of costs to complete are reflected in operations in the period in which facts requiring those revisions become known 
deferred revenue deferred revenue includes i payments received for products not yet delivered  ii advance payments on contract revenues  iii payments received from subscriptions and iv that portion of separately sold software support agreements that has not yet been recognized as revenue 
in connection with the acquisition of companies  the company records deferred revenue at the cost to fulfill plus an applicable gross profit margin  rather than based on the subscription and advanced payments received 
the recognition of revenue in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue 
estimates related to the recognition of revenue include future product returns which may occur based upon actual historical return rates and reduce the company s revenue by these estimated future returns 
as additional information becomes available  or actual amounts are determinable  the recorded estimates are revised 
consequently  operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns management estimates accounts receivable risks and provides allowances for doubtful accounts based on historical analysis and a review of outstanding balances and for sales returns based on the historical rate of return and current market conditions 
management believes that credit risk for accounts receivable is limited because of the large number of customers and because the company s customers are dispersed across different businesses and geographic areas 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
the vast majority of inventories are books  which are reviewed monthly on a title by title basis for salability 
obsolete  damaged  and unmarketable books historically have been insignificant and the cost of inventory determined to be impaired has been charged to income in the period of determination 
assessing the ultimate realization of inventories requires judgment about future demand and market conditions  and management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for obsolete inventory on a quarterly basis 
management makes adjustments to the reserve if the evaluation of reserve requirements differs from the actual aggregate reserve 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because estimates may be revised as more information becomes available 
goodwill goodwill consists of the excess of cost over the value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired under the purchase method of accounting 
through december   goodwill acquired prior to june  had been amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of years 
beginning in january  the company ceased amortizing goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company assesses the recoverability of goodwill by first determining whether the carrying value of all tangible and intangible assets of the applicable business exceed the current fair value of that business 
if carrying values are determined to exceed fair value  the company determines the amount of goodwill impairment based on the excess of the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets in excess of the fair value of the business 
the company has historically used projected discounted future cash flows to determine fair values 
the company reviews the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently  if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired 
management bases its estimates of fair values on historical experience and on various assumptions  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
identified intangible assets identified intangible assets represent the portion of purchase price paid in a business acquisition which has been allocated  based on independent appraisals or management s estimates  to the value of publication agreements  subscriber lists  databases  trademarks and acquired customer relationships  or similar assets 
costs allocated to these assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from years 
beginning in january  the company ceased amortizing intangible assets with indefinite lives in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
intangible assets that are being amortized are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are identified 
the company reviews the carrying value of these intangible assets for impairment by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the estimated undiscounted future cashflows associated with them on a periodic basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
if the company determines that the carrying amount is impaired  the assets will be written down to fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or management s estimates  depending on the nature of the assets 
intangible assets not subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired 
if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss would be recognized 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or management s estimates  depending on the nature of the asset 
pre publication costs prepublication costs  primarily comprised of design and other pre production costs  are deferred and charged to expense over the estimated product life 
these costs are primarily amortized over a four year period following release of the applicable book  using an accelerated amortization period 
it is the company s policy to evaluate the remaining lives and recoverability of such costs on a periodic basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable
