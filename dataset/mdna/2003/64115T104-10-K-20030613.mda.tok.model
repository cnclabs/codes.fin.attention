overview netscout systems  inc designs  develops  manufactures  markets  sells and supports a family of integrated products that enable performance and cost management of complex  high speed networks  including the ability to efficiently deliver critical business applications and content to end users 
we manufacture and market these products in an integrated hardware and software solution that has been used by enterprises  large governmental agencies and service providers worldwide 
we manage our business as a single operating segment and substantially all of our identifiable assets are located in the united states 
netscout was incorporated in as a consulting services company 
in  we began to develop  manufacture and market our first infrastructure performance management products 
our operations have been financed principally through cash provided by operations 
critical accounting policies netscout considers accounting policies related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  valuation of long lived assets and valuation of deferred tax assets to be critical in fully understanding and evaluating our financial results 
revenue recognition product revenue consists of sales of our hardware products and licensing of our software products 
product revenue is recognized upon shipment  provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
for multi element arrangements  each element of the arrangement is analyzed and a portion of the total fee under the arrangement is allocated to the undelivered elements  primarily support agreements and training  using vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the element and the remaining portion of the fee is allocated to the delivered elements ie  generally  hardware products and licensed software products  regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract for each element  under the residual method 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price customers pay when the element is sold separately 
service revenue consists primarily of fees from customer support agreements  consulting and training 
netscout generally provides three months of software support and months of hardware support as part of product sales 
revenue from software support is deferred and recognized ratably over the three month support period 
revenue from hardware support is deferred and recognized ratably over the month support period 
in addition  customers can elect to purchase extended support agreements  typically for month periods 
revenue from these agreements is deferred and recognized ratably over the support period 
revenue from consulting and training is recognized as the work is performed 
license and royalty revenue consists primarily of royalties under license agreements by original equipment manufacturers who incorporate components of our data collection technology into their own products or who reproduce and sell our software products 
license revenue is recognized when delivery has occurred and when we become contractually entitled to receive license fees  provided that such fees are fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
royalty revenue is recognized based upon reported product shipments by the license holder 
revenue generated from indirect distribution channels  including original equipment manufacturers  distributors  resellers  system integrators and service providers  represented  and of total revenue for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
total revenue generated from cisco systems  inc represented  and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
no other customer or indirect channel partner accounted for or more of our total revenue during the fiscal years ended march   and in the past  cisco resold our probes to customers under their private label 
as of july   cisco ceased marketing or selling netscout probes under their private label  however  they continued to place their backlog orders with us through december  we have completed the transition of cisco customers who are actively purchasing our products through either a direct or reseller relationship with netscout 
additionally  cisco continues to incorporate components of our software technology into their products 
on august   we amended our agreement with cisco regarding the incorporation of our software into cisco s products to extend the term of the agreement until november  with automatic renewals for month periods  subject to certain conditions 
revenue from sales outside north america represented  and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
sales outside north america are primarily due to indirect channel partners  who are generally responsible for importing products and providing consulting and technical support and service to customers within their territory 
our reported international revenue does not include any revenue from sales to customers outside north america made by any of our north american based indirect channel partners 
these domestic resellers may sell netscout products to international locations  however  netscout reports these shipments as north america revenue since netscout ships the products to a domestic location 
netscout expects revenue from sales outside north america to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable is reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts 
our normal payment terms are net days 
we monitor all payments from our customers and assess any collection issues as they arise 
we believe our credit policies are prudent and reflect normal industry terms and business risk 
at march   one customer accounted for of our accounts receivable balance  at march   no customer accounted for or more of our accounts receivable balance 
historically  we have not experienced any significant non performance by our customers nor do we anticipate non performance by our customers in the future and  accordingly  we do not require collateral from our customers 
we perform credit checks on all potential new customers prior to acceptance of an order 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for possible losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make their required payments and any losses are recorded as general and administrative expenses 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon our judgments and estimates of the uncollectability of specific accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and customer concentrations 
significant judgments and estimates are made when establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if these accounting judgments and estimates relating to the allowance for doubtful accounts prove to be inadequate  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at actual cost 
inventories consist primarily of raw materials and finished goods 
many components that are necessary for the assembly of our probes are obtained from separate sole source suppliers or a limited group of suppliers 
our reliance on sole or limited suppliers involves several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components and reduced control over pricing  quality and timely delivery of components 
generally  we do not maintain long term agreements with any of our suppliers or large volumes of inventory 
our inability to obtain adequate deliveries or the occurrence of any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of these components would impact our ability to ship our products on a timely basis 
this could damage relationships with current and prospective customers  cause shortfalls in expected revenue and could materially adversely impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
inventories are reduced by a reserve for obsolete and excess inventory 
we regularly monitor our inventories for potential obsolete and excess inventory 
our reserve for obsolete and excess inventory is based upon our estimates of forecasts of unit sales  expected timing and impact of new product introductions  historical product demand  current economic trends  expected market acceptance of our products and expected customer buying patterns 
significant judgments and estimates are made when establishing the reserve for obsolete and excess inventory 
if these accounting judgments and estimates relating to obsolete and excess inventory prove to be inadequate  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
valuation of long lived assets netscout assesses goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis at least annually or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
if the book value of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
as of march   goodwill and other intangible assets were million and  respectively 
we operate as one reporting unit 
we consider the market capitalization of our outstanding common stock versus our stockholders equity as an indicator that may potentially trigger an impairment of goodwill 
although our market capitalization has recently been below our stockholders equity  we do not believe that an impairment of goodwill has occurred 
we believe this decrease in our market capitalization reflected a temporary decline in our stock price 
if adverse economic or industry trends or decrease in customer demand result in a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period in the future  we would need to assess an impairment loss 
significant judgments and estimates are made when assessing impairment 
if our accounting judgments and estimates relating to long lived assets prove to be inadequate  an asset may be determined to be impaired and our financial results could be materially adversely impacted in future periods 
likewise  if a future event or circumstance indicates that an impairment assessment is required and an asset is determined to be impaired  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
valuation of deferred tax assets netscout recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
significant judgments are required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we make an assessment of the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that recovery is not believed to be more likely than not  a valuation allowance is established 
when assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider such factors as our historical cumulative taxable income or loss  projected taxable income in early future periods  trends of our operating results and the strength of our business from both a financial and technological perspective 
as of march   deferred tax assets were million  consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits  which begin to expire in fiscal year  and other temporary differences 
significant accounting judgments and estimates are made when determining our deferred tax assets and assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if our judgments and estimates relating to our deferred tax assets prove to be inadequate  a valuation allowance may be required and our financial results could be materially adversely impacted in the future 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize some or all of the deferred taxes in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets will be charged to income in the period such determination is made 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of total revenue of certain line items included in our statements of operations netscout systems  inc statements of operations percentages year ended march  revenue product service license and royalty total revenue cost of revenue product service total cost of revenue gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of goodwill amortization of other intangible assets in process research and development total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income  net income loss before income taxes benefit income taxes benefit net income loss fiscal years ended march  and revenue total revenues were million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to product 
product revenues were million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to product revenue accounted for and of total revenues for fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in product revenue was primarily due to a decrease in unit sales  which was attributable to the slowdown in network management capital spending in many large enterprises as a result of the economic downturn  partially offset by an increase in the average selling price of approximately attributable to the increased sales of our higher end probes 
we expect the current challenging market resulting from information technology capital spending constraints in the us and abroad and the current economic downturn will have an impact on our future product revenue results and  therefore  in the short term  we expect to have little or no change to our current product revenue 
service 
service revenues were million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  representing an increase of from to service revenues accounted for and of total revenues for the fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in service revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of customer support agreements attributable to new product sales generated over the last year combined with continued renewals of customer support agreements from our expanding installed base 
we anticipate that we will continue to increase our service revenue in fiscal year as our current installed base continues to expand 
license and royalty 
license and royalty revenues were million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to license and royalty revenues accounted for and of total revenues for fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in revenue was primarily due to a decrease in unit sales partially caused by the current economic downturn and also by cisco discontinuing the incorporation of our software into one of their products for part of fiscal year we anticipate a continued decrease in our license and royalty revenues due to royalty price reductions and our decreased focus on royalty partnerships in favor of a concentration on partnerships that more closely complement our current product strategies 
cost of revenue and gross margin product 
cost of product revenue consists primarily of components  personnel costs  media duplication  manuals  packaging materials  licensed technology fees and overhead 
cost of product revenue was million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to product costs accounted for and of total product revenue for the fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in product costs corresponds with the decrease in unit sales attributable to the overall slowdown in network management capital spending in many large enterprises as a result of the economic downturn and obsolescence expense related to a bulk purchase of vendor end of life materials in fiscal year  slightly offset by an approximate increase in average cost attributable to increased sales of our higher end probes  and a decrease in our fixed overhead manufacturing costs and a decrease in personnel expense 
product gross margins were and for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
this increase in product gross margin percentage was primarily due to an increase of approximately in average selling price per unit and a decrease in our fixed manufacturing costs  partially offset by an approximate increase in average cost per unit 
service 
cost of service revenue consists primarily of personnel  material and consulting costs 
cost of service revenues were million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  representing an increase of from to service costs accounted for and of total service revenue for the fiscal years and  respectively 
service gross margins were and for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the increase in costs and decrease in gross margin percentage were primarily due to increases in our personnel and related travel costs 
while service revenue increased by  cost of service revenue increased by  resulting in the decrease in service gross margin 
gross margins were million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to gross margin percentage was and for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
gross margin is primarily impacted by the mix of product  service  license and royalty revenue and by the proportion of sales through direct versus indirect distribution channels 
we realize significantly higher gross margins on license and royalty revenue relative to product and service revenue 
we typically realize higher gross margins on direct sales relative to sales through indirect distribution channels 
the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily due to an increase in product margin percentage which resulted from an increase of approximately in average selling price per unit and a decrease in our fixed manufacturing costs  partially offset by an increase in average cost per unit 
this increase was somewhat offset by a decrease in license and royalty revenue  which have no related costs and thereby have high margins 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  fees for outside consultants and related costs associated with the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products 
research and development expenses were million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to research and development expenses accounted for of total revenue for each of the fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in expenses was primarily due to a decrease in stock based compensation charges related to the nextpoint acquisition from to and an decrease in personnel costs related to incentive compensation from to headcount in research and development was and for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
we anticipate that in fiscal year  we will decrease research and development expenses in absolute dollars primarily due to decreased stock based compensation expenses 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and other costs associated with marketing programs such as trade shows  seminars  advertising and new product launch activities 
sales and marketing expenses were million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to sales and marketing expense costs accounted for and of total revenue for the fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in total expenses was primarily due to a decrease in personnel costs related to a decrease in commission expense due to lower sales volume and a decrease in spending on marketing programs from to headcount in sales and marketing was and for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
we anticipate that we will increase sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars due to increased commission compensation as a result of an anticipated shift in revenue from non commissionable sales  such as royalties  to commissionable sales  such as product and service sales  and an increase in marketing programs for fiscal year general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for executive  financial and human resource employees 
general and administrative expenses were million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to general and administrative expenses accounted for of total revenue for the fiscal years and  respectively 
this decrease in total expenses was primarily due to decreases in various general and administrative expenses including personnel  other incentive compensation  accounting services and investor relations expenses partially offset by a million write off of a note receivable 
headcount in general and administrative was and for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
we anticipate that we will decrease general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars in fiscal year primarily due to a one time impairment charge of a notes receivable recorded in fiscal year  which will not impact fiscal year expenses

contractual obligations as of march   we had the following current contractual obligations in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations     purchase obligations royalty obligations total contractual obligations     guarantor s agreements netscout indemnifies its officers and directors from certain occurrences while they are or were serving in an official capacity for the company and this indemnification remains effective for the benefit of that individual s estate  heirs  executors and administrators 
the maximum potential amount of future payments that netscout may be required to make is unknown  however  netscout does carry directors and officers insurance policies that limit our exposure 
as a result of our current insurance policy coverage  we believe that the total impact of netscout s indemnification obligations  while limited  could potentially have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
netscout warrants that its software and hardware products will substantially conform to the documentation accompanying such products on their original date of shipment 
for software  which also includes software embedded in our probes  the standard warranty commences upon shipment and expires ninety days thereafter 
with regard to hardware  the standard warranty commences upon shipment and expires twelve months thereafter 
additionally  this warranty is subject to various exclusions which include but are not limited to non conformance resulting from modifications made to the software or hardware by a party other than netscout or damage to hardware caused by a power surge or a force majeure event 
we also warrant that all of our support services shall be performed in a good and workmanlike manner 
we believe our product and support services warranties are consistent with commonly accepted industry standards 
contracts that we enter into in the ordinary course of business may contain standard indemnification provisions 
pursuant to these agreements  we may agree to defend any third party claims brought against a partner or direct customer claiming infringement of such third party s i us patent  ii berne convention member country copyright  and or iii us  eu and or ohim trademark or intellectual property rights 
moreover  this indemnity may require netscout to pay any damages awarded against the partner or direct customer in such type of lawsuit as well as reimburse the partner or direct customer for any reasonable attorney s fees incurred by them from the lawsuit 
on very limited occasions  we may agree to provide other forms of indemnification to partners or direct customers  such as indemnification that would obligate us to defend and pay any damages awarded to a third party against a partner or direct customer based on a lawsuit alleging that such third party has suffered personal injury and or tangible property damage legally caused by negligently designed or manufactured products 
the term associated with these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual 
the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to pay arising from indemnification agreements may be limited to a certain monetary value 
however  the monetary exposure associated with the majority of these indemnification agreements is unlimited 
we have never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
currently  we believe that there is not likely to be a material impact to our financial results  but if we were to have to defend a related lawsuit and settle claims  they could potentially have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term marketable securities  totaling million 
we have a line of credit with a bank  which allows us to borrow up to million for working capital purposes and to obtain letters of credit 
the line of credit expired on june  and we are currently in the process of renewing the line of credit with substantially similar terms 
such renewal is in the final stages and we expect completion of the renewal in june amounts available under the line of credit were a function of eligible accounts receivable and bear interest at the bank s prime rate and were secured by our inventory and accounts receivable 
under the agreement we were required to comply with certain financial covenants 
as of march   we were in compliance with such covenants 
as of march   we had letters of credit outstanding under the line aggregating million relating to our current principle operating lease 
in the event that we are unsuccessful in securing the line of credit  we have the ability to secure the letter of credit against our current cash reserve balances 
cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
in the fiscal year ended march   cash provided by operating activities was primarily derived from decreases in accounts receivable as a result of collection activities and decreases in inventories as a result of managing inventory levels  and increases in deferred revenue as a result of an increase in the number of customer support agreements attributable to new product sales generated over the last year combined with continued renewals of customer support agreements from our expanding installed base 
these were partially offset by a net loss  decreases in accounts payable and accrued compensation and other expenses as a result of the timing of when payments were due and a reduction in incentive compensation paid to employees and an increase in refundable income taxes as a result of net operating loss carry backs and research and development credit carry backs 
in the fiscal year ended march   cash provided by operating activities was primarily derived from a decrease in inventories as a result of managing inventory levels  an increase in depreciation and amortization and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of continued depreciation of fixed assets and amortization related to the acquisition of nextpoint  compensation expense associated with equity awards related to the acquisition of nextpoint and deferred revenue as a result of an increase in the number of customer support agreements attributable to new product sales generated over the last year combined with continued renewals of customer support agreements from our expanding installed base 
this was partially offset by a net loss  decreases in accounts payable as a result of the timing of when payments were due and a reduction in incentive compensation paid to employees and an increase in other long term assets as a result of a prepaid royalty reclassification 
in the fiscal year ended march   cash provided by operating activities was primarily derived from net income  an increase in depreciation and amortization and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets  compensation expense associated with equity awards related to the acquisition of nextpoint and deferred revenue as a result of an increase in the number of customer support agreements attributable to new product sales generated over the last year combined with continued renewals of customer support agreements from our expanding installed base and an increase in accounts payable as a result of the timing of when payments were due 
this was partially offset by increases in inventories as a result of lower than anticipated sales volume and decreases in accrued compensation and other expenses as the result of paying some additional expenses due to the acquisition of nextpoint 
cash provided by used in investing activities was million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
for the fiscal years ended march   and  cash provided by used in investing activities have consisted of net proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities  reduced by the purchase of fixed assets 
also for the fiscal year ended march   netscout acquired nextpoint in july cash provided by financing activities was   and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
for the fiscal years ended march    and  cash provided by financing activities was mainly due to proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 
on september   netscout announced an open market stock repurchase program that enables netscout to purchase up to million shares of its outstanding common stock  subject to market conditions and other factors 
for the fiscal year ended march   netscout repurchased  shares of its common stock under this program 
cash to be used under this program in the future is undeterminable at this point in time 
in  proceeds from the issuance of common stock were offset by a repayment of notes payable as part of the acquisition of nextpoint 
we believe that our current cash balances  marketable securities classified as available for sale and any future cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
if demand for our products were to decrease substantially there could be a material impact on our ability to generate cash flow sufficient for our short term working capital and expenditure needs 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or convertible debt securities 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which is effective for the first quarter of fiscal year sfas no 
addresses the financial reporting for obligations and retirement costs relating to the retirement of tangible long lived assets

certain factors which may impact future results our operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and may in the future vary significantly depending on a number of factors 
except for the historical information in this report  the matters contained in this report include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this report 
additional risks that are not yet identified or that we currently think are immaterial may also impact our business operations 
such factors  among others  may have a material adverse impact upon our business  results of operations and financial condition 
a termination of our strategic relationship with cisco may materially adversely impact our business 
cisco incorporates some of our software in their products and provides license and royalty revenue to netscout 
license and royalty revenue and service revenue from cisco accounted for  and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
cisco could decide to cease purchasing our software and or to internally develop products that compete with our solutions or partner with our competitors or bundle or sell competitors solutions  possibly at lower prices 
if our strategic relationship with cisco were terminated for any reason  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate 
our quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
most of our expenses  such as employee compensation and rent  are relatively fixed in the short term 
moreover  our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations regarding future revenue levels 
as a result  if revenue for a particular quarter is below our expectations  we may not be able to reduce operating expenses proportionately for that quarter  and  therefore  this revenue shortfall would have a disproportionately negative impact on our operating results for that quarter 
our quarterly revenue may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control  including the following current technology spending by actual and potential customers  the market for network management solutions is in an early stage of development and  therefore  demand for our solutions may be uneven  the timing and receipt of orders from customers  especially in light of our lengthy sales cycle  the timing and market acceptance of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  distribution channels through which our products are sold could change  the timing of hiring sales personnel and the speed at which such personnel become productive  we may not be able to anticipate or adapt effectively to developing markets and rapidly changing technologies  our prices or the prices of our competitors products may change  continuation or worsening of the current economic slowdown and the occurrence of unforeseeable events  such as international terrorist attacks  which contribute to such slowdowns  and unknown duration and potential spread of the current severe acute respiratory syndrome sars situation 
we operate with minimal backlog because our products typically are shipped shortly after orders are received 
as a result  product revenue in any quarter is substantially dependent upon orders booked and shipped in that quarter  and revenue for any future quarter is not predictable to any degree of certainty 
therefore  any significant deferral of orders for our products would cause a shortfall in revenue for that quarter 
our continued growth depends on our ability to maintain and periodically expand our sales force 
we must maintain and periodically increase the size of our sales force in order to increase our direct sales and support our indirect sales channels 
because our products are very technical  sales people require a long period of time to become productive  typically three to twelve months 
this lag in productivity  as well as the challenge of attracting qualified candidates  may make it difficult to meet our sales force growth targets 
further  we may not generate sufficient sales to offset the increased expense resulting from growing our sales force 
if we are unable to successfully maintain and periodically expand our sales capability  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted 
our success depends on our ability to manage indirect distribution channels 
sales to our indirect distribution channels accounted for  and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
while cisco no longer resold our probes as of july   they did continue to place backlog orders with us through december   and they continue to incorporate some of our software in their products 
cisco accounted for  and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
during the past months we have worked to transition a large portion of our sales efforts from support of the cisco distribution channel to the development of more of our own direct sales and other indirect distribution channels 
to increase our sales going forward we need to continue to enhance our direct sales efforts and to continue to develop new and further expand and manage existing indirect distribution channels  including original equipment manufacturers  distributors  resellers  systems integrators and service providers 
our indirect channel partners have no obligation to purchase any products from us 
in addition  they could internally develop products that compete with our solutions or partner with our competitors or bundle or resell competitors solutions  possibly at lower prices 
the potential inability to develop new relationships and to expand and manage our existing relationships with partners  the potential inability or unwillingness of our partners to effectively market and sell our products or the loss of existing partnerships could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we fail to introduce new products and enhance our existing products to keep up with rapid technological change  demand for our products may decline 
the market for network management solutions is relatively new and is characterized by rapid changes in technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements and frequent product introductions and enhancements 
our success is dependent upon our ability to meet our customers needs  which are driven by changes in computer networking technologies and the emergence of new industry standards 
in addition  new technologies may shorten the life cycle for our products or could render our existing or planned products obsolete 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new network and application infrastructure performance management products or enhancements to existing products in a timely and successful manner  it could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in the future  we intend to introduce new products related to our previously announced cdm strategy 
if the introduction of these products is significantly delayed or if we are not successful in selling these products to our current and potential customers  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted 
the current economic and geopolitical environment may impact some specific industries into which we sell 
many of our customers are concentrated in a small number of industries  including financial services  government and high technology 
certain industries may be more acutely affected by economic  geopolitical and other factors than other industries 
to the extent that one or more of the industries in which our customer base operates are adversely impacted  whether as a result of general conditions affecting all industries or as a result of conditions affecting only those particular industries  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted 
our reliance on sole source suppliers could adversely impact our business 
many components that are necessary for the assembly of our probes are obtained from separate sole source suppliers or a limited group of suppliers 
these components include some of our network interface cards 
our reliance on sole or limited suppliers involves several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components and reduced control over pricing  quality and timely delivery of components 
we do not generally maintain long term agreements with any of our suppliers or large volumes of inventory 
our inability to obtain adequate deliveries or the occurrence of any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of these components would impact our ability to ship our products on a timely basis 
this could damage relationships with current and prospective customers  cause shortfalls in expected revenue and could materially adversely impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
our estimates and judgments related to critical accounting policies could be inaccurate 
we consider accounting policies related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  valuation of long lived assets and valuation of net deferred tax assets to be critical in fully understanding and evaluating our financial results 
management makes certain significant accounting judgments and estimates related to these policies 
our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods if our accounting judgments and estimates related to these critical accounting policies prove to be inadequate 
long lived assets and goodwill may become impaired 
netscout regularly performs reviews of the carrying value of our long lived assets  consisting of fixed assets  goodwill and other intangible assets and other assets  to determine if any impairment is present 
items that could trigger impairment include  but are not limited to  current economic trends  customer buying patterns  expected revenue projections  significant underperformance of product demand relative to historical product demand  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and significant decline in our technological value compared to the market 
with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective april   goodwill and the un amortized assembled workforce intangible asset are no longer subject to amortization 
we currently have million in goodwill as of march  due to the current volatile changes in our current stock price  our market capitalization may be below stockholders equity for a sustained period of time and a determination may be made that our goodwill asset have become impaired  and we may be required to record an impairment loss which could materially impact our financial results 
we face significant competition from other technology companies 
the market for network management solutions is intensely competitive 
we believe customers make network management system purchasing decisions based primarily upon the following factors product performance  functionality and price  name and reputation of vendor  distribution strength  and or alliances with industry partners 
we compete with providers of network performance management solutions  such as concord communications  inc and providers of portable network traffic analyzers and probes  such as network associates  inc in addition  leading network equipment providers  including cisco  could offer their own or competitors solutions in the future 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition and substantially greater financial  management  marketing  service  support  technical  distribution and other resources than we do 
therefore  they may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards or customer requirements 
as a result of these and other factors  we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the success of our business depends on the continued growth in the market for and the commercial acceptance of network management solutions 
we derive all of our revenue from the sale of products and services that are designed to allow our customers to manage the performance of computer networks 
the market for network management solutions is in an early stage of development 
therefore  we cannot accurately assess the size of the market and may be unable to predict the appropriate features and prices for products to address the market  the optimal distribution strategy and the competitive environment that will develop 
in order for us to be successful  our potential customers must recognize the value of more sophisticated network management solutions  decide to invest in the management of their networks and  in particular  adopt our management solutions 
any failure of this market to continue to develop would materially adversely impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
businesses may choose to outsource the management of their networks to service providers 
our business may depend on our ability to continue to develop relationships with these service providers and successfully market our products to them 
failure to properly manage growth could adversely impact our business 
the growth in size and complexity of our business and our customer base has been and will continue to be a challenge to our management and operations 
to manage further growth effectively  we must enhance our financial information and accounting systems and controls  integrate new personnel and manage expanded operations 
if we are unable to effectively manage our growth  our costs  the quality of our products  the effectiveness of our sales organization  and our ability to retain key personnel  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted 
loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business 
our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills  experience and efforts of anil singhal  our president  chief executive officer and co founder  and narendra popat  our chairman of the board and co founder 
we also depend on the ability of our other executive officers and senior managers to work effectively as a team 
the loss of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we must hire and retain skilled personnel 
our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract  train  motivate and retain highly skilled employees  particularly sales and marketing personnel  software engineers  and technical support personnel 
if we are unable to attract and retain the highly skilled technical personnel that are integral to our sales  marketing  product development and technical support teams  the rate at which we can generate sales and develop new products or product enhancements may be limited 
this inability could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 
our business is heavily dependent on our intellectual property 
we rely upon a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and non disclosure and other contractual arrangements to protect our proprietary rights 
the reverse engineering  unauthorized copying  or other misappropriation of our intellectual property could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without compensating us 
legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights could be burdensome and expensive and could involve a high degree of uncertainty 
in addition  legal proceedings may divert management s attention from growing our business 
there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information  or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use by third parties and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
further  we also license software from third parties for use as part of our products  and if any of these licenses were to terminate  we may experience delays in product shipment until we develop or license alternative software 
others may claim that we infringe on their intellectual property rights 
we may be subject to claims by others that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights  patents  copyrights or trademarks 
these claims  whether or not valid  could require us to spend significant sums in litigation  pay damages  delay product shipments  reengineer our products  rename our products and rebuild name recognition or acquire licenses to such third party intellectual property 
we may not be able to secure any required licenses on commercially reasonable terms or secure them at all 
we expect that these claims could become more frequent as more companies enter the market for network and application infrastructure performance management solutions 
any of these claims or resulting events could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if our products contain errors  they may be costly to correct  revenue may be delayed  we could be sued and our reputation could be harmed 
despite testing by our customers and us  errors may be found in our products after commencement of commercial shipments 
if errors are discovered  we may not be able to successfully correct them in a timely manner or at all 
in addition  we may need to make significant expenditures of capital resources in order to eliminate errors and failures 
errors and failures in our products could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and could damage our reputation 
if one or more of our products fail  a customer may assert warranty and other claims for substantial damages against us 
the occurrence or discovery of these types of errors or failures could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our success depends on our ability to expand and manage our international operations 
sales outside north america accounted for  and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
we currently expect international revenue to continue to account for a significant percentage of total revenue in the future 
we believe that we must continue to expand our international sales activities in order to be successful 
our international sales growth will be limited if we are unable to expand international indirect distribution channels  hire additional sales personnel  adapt products for local markets  and manage geographically dispersed operations 
the major countries outside of north america in which we do or intend to do business  are the united kingdom  germany  japan and china 
our international operations  including our operations in the united kingdom  germany  japan and china  are generally subject to a number of risks  including failure of local laws to provide the same degree of protection as the laws in the united states provide against infringement of our intellectual property  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors  dependence on local indirect channel partners  multiple conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  longer sales cycles  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and political and economic instability 
the price of our common stock may decrease due to market volatility 
the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and has fluctuated significantly since the initial public offering of our common stock on august  the market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
trading activity of our stock tends to be minimal as a result of officers and directors and their affiliates holding a significant percentage of our stock 
in addition  the market prices of securities of technology companies have been extremely volatile and have experienced fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
also  broad market fluctuations could adversely impact the market price of our common stock  which in turn could cause impairment of goodwill that could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
recently  when the market price of a stock has been volatile  holders of that stock have occasionally instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issues that stock 
if any of our stockholders brought such a lawsuit against us  even if the lawsuit is without merit  we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit 
the lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management 
limits on the effectiveness of our disclosure and internal controls 
our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls may not prevent all errors and intentional misrepresentations 
any control system can only provide reasonable assurances that all control objectives are met 
as with any control system  the cost effectiveness of controls must be measured 
some of the potential risks involved could include but are not limited to management judgments  simple errors or mistakes  willful misconduct regarding controls or misinterpretation 
there is no guarantee that current controls will prevent or detect all material issues or be effective in future conditions  which could materially impact our financial results in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we consider all highly liquid marketable securities purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents and those with maturities greater than three months are considered to be marketable securities 
cash equivalents and short term marketable securities are stated at cost plus accrued interest  which approximates fair value 
long term marketable securities are stated at fair value based on quoted market prices 
cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of money market instruments and us treasury bills 
netscout s primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure  but do not believe that a fluctuation in interest rates would have a material impact on the value of our cash equivalents 
netscout s exposure to interest rates based on outstanding debt has been and is expected to continue to be modest due to the fact that although we currently are in the process of renewing our million line of credit with million of letters of credit secured against it  we have no amounts outstanding under the line and no other outstanding interest bearing debt 
netscout s exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations has been limited 
all revenue transactions are completed in us dollars 
netscout does pay for certain operating expenses such as foreign payroll  rent and office expense in foreign currency and  therefore  currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
currently  netscout does not engage in foreign currency hedging activities 
the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations is recorded in the period incurred
