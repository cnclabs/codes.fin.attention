there were no contingent payments  pre acquisition contingencies or other commitments specified in the acquisition agreement 
on april   we acquired certain assets of seiko contactlens  inc seiko

seiko had been our distributor in japan 
we have accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method

critical accounting policies the company s critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  estimating valuation allowances  accounting for income taxes  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  and estimates inherent in purchase accounting 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized based on the terms of sale with the customer  generally upon product shipment 
we have established programs that  under specified conditions  enable our customers to return product 
we establish reserves for estimated returns and allowances at the time revenues are recognized 
in addition  accruals for customer discounts and rebates are recorded when revenues are recognized 
amounts billed to customers in sale transactions related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
regarding recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue 
sab no 
provides revenue recognition guidelines in the absence of authoritative literature addressing a specific arrangement or a specific industry 
we implemented sab in the fourth quarter of  which did not have any material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
estimating valuation allowances the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we specifically analyze the aging of accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms and sales returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue and or expenses for any period if different judgments had been made or different estimates utilized 
we sell our products to a diverse group of optometrists  optical retailers  optical product distributors and ophthalmologists  and therefore the concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited due to the large number and diversity of customers across broad geographic areas 
accounts receivable from customers are uncollateralized 
as of december   one customer accounted for of accounts receivable 
to reduce credit risk  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of significant customers respective financial conditions 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends and other information 
we assess the need for reserves on inventory generally based on monthly forward projections of sales of products that are updated periodically 
inventories are recorded at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
cost includes material  labor and applicable factory overhead 
provision for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory is made based upon our analysis of inventory levels and forecasted sales 
once inventory is reserved  the reserve can only be relieved by the subsequent sale or disposal of the inventory 
accounting for income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our financial position and results of operations could be materially impacted 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we periodically review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
goodwill and certain intangible assets  which are not subject to amortization  are periodically reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
for assets to be held and used  including acquired intangibles  we initiate our review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows without interest charges that the asset is expected to generate 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
significant management judgment is required in this process 
in january  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we have ceased to amortize goodwill and assembled workforce beginning january  as of december   unamortized goodwill and assembled workforce was approximately million 
in lieu of amortization  we were required to perform an initial impairment review of goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we have completed the first step of sfas no 
transitional goodwill impairment test and have determined that as of january  our goodwill had not been impaired 
during the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual impairment test and concluded that there is no impairment of our goodwill 
in the future  we will perform the annual impairment test required by sfas no 
in the fourth quarter of each year 
we cannot assure you that a material impairment charge will not be recorded in the future 
estimates inherent in purchase accounting purchase accounting requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the assets purchased and liabilities assumed 
in our recording of the acquisitions of the assets of essilor and seiko contactlens  values were assigned to identifiable intangible assets based on management s forecasts and projections that include assumptions related to future revenues and cash flows generated from the acquired assets 
the allocation of essilor s purchase price to in process research and development of million represented the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete research and development projects 
at february   the development of these projects had not reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  results of operations the following table summarizes certain items on the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of sales years ended december  net sales gross profit selling and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses research and development expenses write off of impaired manufacturing equipment restructuring and related expenses acquired in process research and development expenses income from operations interest and other income  net income before taxes provision for income taxes net income net sales net sales were million in  an increase of from net sales were million in  an increase of from the increase in was primarily due to additional sales generated by the seiko acquisition  increased sales of our new toric and color disposable lens products and growth in international sales in addition to japan

the decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to unfavorable product mix and declining average selling prices 
the unfavorable mix resulted from an increase in sales of daily disposable products at gross margins lower than other products 
the increase in the gross margin percentage in as compared to was due to higher margin products sales that resulted from the essilor acquisition

the increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales in compared to was primarily due to expenditures related to activities in connection with new product development  including the completion of our new disposable toric product  which was launched in march and development of our new color product launched in write off of impaired manufacturing equipment the write off of impaired manufacturing equipment was attributable to the implementation of our second generation daily disposable manufacturing process in southampton  united kingdom during this new facility uses our second generation manufacturing process and adds considerable daily disposable manufacturing capacity while reducing manufacturing costs 
with the implementation of the first production line utilizing the second generation manufacturing process  we concluded that certain existing manufacturing equipment had become impaired 
as a result  we recorded during the fourth quarter of  a charge of million for the write off of impaired manufacturing equipment arising from the second generation manufacturing process 
restructuring and related expenses during the fourth quarter of  we accelerated the implementation of our second generation manufacturing process throughout our high volume product lines 
given the lower labor and space requirements of these processes  we will consolidate our manufacturing operations into a smaller total plant structure 
the initiative will allow us to meet volume production goals in substantially less space with lower manufacturing overhead 
we believe that this initiative will result in an annual cost savings of million by we expect the initiative to be completed by and cost a total of approximately million  million of which is non cash 
as a result of this initiative  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million in of the million  approximately million relates to impairment of property and equipment  million relates to employee severance and benefit costs  million relates to leased facilities that will be abandoned within one year and the remaining million relates to miscellaneous costs  such as professional fees related to the initiative 
for leased facilities that will be abandoned and subleased  the lease costs represent future lease payments subsequent to abandonment less estimated sublease income 
for owned property and equipment  the impairment loss recognized was based on the estimated fair value of the equipment

interest and other income  net interest and other income  net increased to million in from million in in  interest and other income  net was million 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to a reversal of an accrual for certain services of million and foreign exchange gains in the decrease in the dollar amount of interest and other income  net from to  resulted primarily from the decrease in available cash balances used in the acquisition of the essilor contact lens business and a merger termination fee of million net of million related expenses

recently issued accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  accounting for certain sales incentives  effective january  eitf requires that costs related to consumer coupons be classified as a reduction of sales 
we have thus reclassified as deductions to net sales  million and million  for and these balances were previously classified as selling and marketing expenses 
the eitf also issued eitf  vendor income statement characterization of consideration to a purchaser of the vendor s products or services  effective january  eitf requires that certain of our customer promotional incentive payments  primarily cooperative merchandising allowances  be classified as a reduction of sales 
we reclassified as deductions in net sales approximately million and million of customer promotional incentives that were previously classified as selling and marketing expenses in and  respectively 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb approved the issuance of sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
provides guidance on the accounting for a business combination at the date a business combination is completed 
the statement requires the use of the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june   thereby eliminating use of the pooling of interests method 
we adopted this statement as of july  sfas no 
provides guidance on how to account for goodwill and intangible assets after an acquisition is completed 
the most substantive change is that goodwill and other indefinite life assets will no longer be amortized but instead will be tested for impairment periodically 
we adopted this statement as of january  in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  in that it removes goodwill from its impairment scope and allows for different approaches in cash flow estimation 
however  sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions of sfas no 
for a recognition and measurement of long live assets to be held and used and b measurement of ling lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
also supersedes the business segment concept in apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  in that it permits presentation of a component of an entity  whether classified as held for sale or disposed of  as a discontinued operation 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  the implementation of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities in june  sfas no 
addresses accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit and disposal activities and supercedes eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  as defined by the statement 
under eitf  an exit cost was recognized at the date an entity committed to an exit plan 
additionally  sfas no 
provides that exit and disposal costs should be measured at fair value and that the associated liability will be adjusted for changes in estimated cash flows 
we will adopt sfas no 
effective january  in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements of interim and annual periods after december  liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements have generally been funded from operations  cash and investments on hand  and debt borrowings 
our cash and investments in marketable debt securities  which totaled million at december   are invested in a diversified portfolio of financial instruments  including money market instruments and government or government agency securities and other debt securities issued by financial institutions and other issuers with strong credit ratings 
by policy  the amount of credit exposure to any one institution is limited 
investments are generally not collateralized and primarily mature within three years 
sources and uses of cash cash and cash equivalents at december  of million increased from a december  balance of million 
working capital increased to million in december  from million at december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents in was primarily due to cash flow from operations  primarily net income adjusted for non cash depreciation and amortization and write off of impaired manufacturing equipment million offset by increases in operating assets million 
in addition to our cash flow from operating activities of million  we generated million from financing activities  mostly from short term borrowings 
these increases were partially offset by cash outflow used in investing activities 
approximately million of the cash used in investing activities represented capital expenditures 
the remaining million used in investing activities related to the acquisition of the assets of seiko 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands long term debt purchase obligations operating leases year ending december  thereafter   total    on april   we completed a new million credit facility with two banks 
revolving loans under this facility mature on april   and bear interest at below one of the bank s prime rate or to above the eurodollar rate depending on our ratio of total funded debt to earnings before interest and taxes plus non cash charges 
the facility provides an option to convert any outstanding revolving loans not to exceed million at the maturity date to a four year term loan 
the term loan  once repaid  may not be reborrowed 
this credit agreement contains covenants  which  among other things  require us to maintain certain financial ratios 
as of december   there were million of revolving loans outstanding under this credit agreement and the interest rate was and on loan balances of million and million  respectively 
this revolving loan is included in long term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet as of december  based on our ability and intent to defer payment beyond december  borrowings under this agreement are secured by a pledge of of the outstanding common stock of ocular sciences puerto rico and sunsoft  inc and of the outstanding common stock of our barbados and canadian subsidiaries 
as of december   we were not in compliance with certain covenants 
a waiver was obtained from the banks as of december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we have long term debt outstanding  which we carry at cost  with an interest rate  which is referenced to market rates 
interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair value of variable rate debt instruments  but do impact future earnings and cash flows 
holding debt levels constant  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would decrease pre tax earnings and cash flows for variable rate debt by approximately  and  as of december  and  respectively 
impact of foreign currency rate changes we operate multiple foreign subsidiaries that manufacture and or sell our products worldwide 
as a result  our earnings  cash flows and financial position are exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency denominated receivables and payables  forecasted sales transactions  and net investment in certain foreign operations 
we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging activities  however  we continue to evaluate the use of such opportunities
