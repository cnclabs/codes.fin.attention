item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations please refer to forward looking statements following the index in front of this form k 
general following is a discussion and analysis of the financial statements and other statistical data that management believes will enhance the understanding of afg s financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements beginning on page f critical accounting policies significant accounting policies are summarized in note a to the financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that can have a significant effect on amounts reported in the financial statements 
as more information becomes known  these estimates and assumptions could change and thus impact amounts reported in the future 
management believes that the establishment of insurance reserves  especially asbestos and environmental related reserves  and the determination of other than temporary impairment on investments are the two areas where the degree of judgment required to determine amounts recorded in the financial statements make the accounting policies critical 
for further discussion of these policies  see liquidity and capital resources investments and liquidity and capital resources uncertainties 
liquidity and capital resources ratios afg s debt to total capital ratio at the parent holding company level was approximately at december   compared to at december  afg used a portion of the proceeds from the infinity sale in february to repay parent debt 
adjusting to reflect this repayment reduces the ratio to at december  afg s ratio of earnings to fixed charges  including annuity benefits as a fixed charge  was for the year ended december  excluding annuity benefits  this ratio was for although not required to be disclosed  the ratio excluding interest on annuities is presented because interest credited to annuity policyholder accounts is not always considered a borrowing cost for an insurance company 
the national association of insurance commissioners model law for risk based capital rbc applies to both life and property and casualty companies 
rbc formulas determine the amount of capital that an insurance company needs to ensure that it has an acceptable expectation of not becoming financially impaired 
at december   the capital ratios of all afg insurance companies substantially exceeded the rbc requirements the lowest capital ratio of any afg subsidiary was times its authorized control level rbc  weighted average of all afg subsidiaries was times 
sources of funds afg  afc and american premier are organized as holding companies with almost all of their operations being conducted by subsidiaries 
these parent corporations  however  have continuing cash needs for administrative expenses  the payment of principal and interest on borrowings  shareholder dividends  and taxes 
funds to meet these obligations come primarily from dividend and tax payments from their subsidiaries 
management believes these parent holding companies have sufficient resources to meet their liquidity requirements 
if funds generated from operations  including dividends and tax payments from subsidiaries  are insufficient to meet fixed charges in any period  these companies would be required to generate cash through borrowings  sales of securities or other assets  or similar transactions 
the parent holding companies have a reciprocal master credit agreement under which these companies make funds available to each other for general corporate purposes 
in november  afc replaced its million bank credit line with a new bank credit agreement 
currently  afc may borrow up to million under the new agreement  the line may be expanded to million through the end of the new line consists of two facilities a day revolving facility  extendable annually  for one third of the total line and a three year revolving facility for the remaining two thirds 
amounts borrowed bear interest at rates ranging from to over libor based on afg s credit rating 
this credit agreement provides ample liquidity and can be used to obtain funds for operating subsidiaries or  if necessary  for the parent companies 
at december   there was million borrowed under the agreement 
at march   there was million borrowed under the line 
in december  afg issued million shares of common stock  using the million in net cash proceeds to make capital contributions to its property and casualty operations 
all debentures issued by the parent holding companies and gafri are rated investment grade by three nationally recognized rating agencies 
under a currently effective shelf registration statement  afg can issue up to an aggregate of approximately million in additional common stock  debt or trust securities 
the shelf registration provides afg with greater flexibility to access the capital markets from time to time as market and other conditions permit 
for statutory accounting purposes  equity securities of non affiliates are generally carried at market value 
at december   afg s insurance companies owned publicly traded equity securities with a market value of million 
in addition  great american owns gafri common stock with a market value of million and a carrying value of million 
since significant amounts of these are concentrated in a relatively small number of companies  decreases in the market prices could adversely affect the insurance group s capital  potentially impacting the amount of dividends available or necessitating a capital contribution 
conversely  increases in the market prices could have a favorable impact on the group s dividend paying capability 
under tax allocation agreements with afc  its owned us subsidiaries generally compute tax provisions as if filing separate returns based on book taxable income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the resulting provision or credit is currently payable to or receivable from afc 
investments approximately two thirds of afg s consolidated assets are invested in marketable securities 
afg s investment portfolio at december   contained billion in fixed maturities and million in other stocks  all carried at market value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of shareholders equity on an after tax basis 
at december   afg had pretax net unrealized gains of million on fixed maturities and million on other stocks 
afg attempts to optimize investment income while building the value of its portfolio  placing emphasis upon long term performance 
afg s goal is to maximize return on an ongoing basis rather than focusing on short term performance 
fixed income investment funds are generally invested in securities with intermediate term maturities with an objective of optimizing total return while allowing flexibility to react to changes in market conditions 
at december   the average life of afg s fixed maturities was about six years 
approximately of the fixed maturities held by afg were rated investment grade credit rating of aaa to bbb by nationally recognized rating agencies at december  investment grade securities generally bear lower yields and lower degrees of risk than those that are unrated or noninvestment grade 
management believes that the high quality investment portfolio should generate a stable and predictable investment return 
investments in mortgage backed securities mbss represented approximately one fourth of afg s fixed maturities at december  mbss are subject to significant prepayment risk due to the fact that  in periods of declining interest rates  mortgages may be repaid more rapidly than scheduled as borrowers refinance higher rate mortgages to take advantage of lower rates 
due to the significant decline in the general level of interest rates in  afg has experienced an increase in the level of prepayments on its mbss  these prepayments have not been reinvested at interest rates comparable to the rates earned on the prepaid mbss 
substantially all of afg s mbss are investment grade quality  with over rated aaa at december  summarized information for the unrealized gains and losses recorded in afg s balance sheet at december   is shown in the following table dollars in millions 
approximately million of fixed maturities and million of other stocks had no unrealized gains or losses at december  securities securities with with unrealized unrealized gains losses fixed maturities market value of securities   amortized cost of securities   gross unrealized gain loss market value as of amortized cost number of security positions  number individually exceeding million gain or loss concentration of gains losses by type or industry exceeding of unrealized mortgage backed securities banks and savings institutions us government and government agencies state and municipal electric services asset backed securities air transportation generally collateralized percentage rated investment grade other stocks market value of securities cost of securities gross unrealized gain loss market value as of cost number individually exceeding million gain or loss afg s investment in equity securities of provident financial group  a cincinnati based commercial banking and financial services company  represents million of the million in unrealized gains on other stocks at december  at march   the unrealized gain on provident was approximately million 
the table below sets forth the scheduled maturities of fixed maturity securities at december   based on their market values 
asset backed securities and other securities with sinking funds are reported at average maturity 
actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain securities may be called or prepaid by the issuers 
securities securities with with unrealized unrealized maturity gains losses one year or less after one year through five years after five years through ten years after ten years mortgage backed securities afg realized aggregate losses of million during on million in sales of fixed maturity securities issues  issuers that had individual unrealized losses greater than  at december  market values of eleven of the securities increased an aggregate of million from year end to date of sale 
the market value of one of the securities did not change from year end to the date of sale 
one of the securities was a conseco bond that decreased in value by million from year end to the date of sale due to the continued decline in conseco s financial condition 
the market value of the remaining security decreased  from year end to the sale date 
although afg had the ability to continue holding these investments  its intent to hold them changed due primarily to deterioration in the issuers creditworthiness  decisions to lessen exposure to a particular credit or industry  or to modify asset allocation within the portfolio 
the table below dollars in millions summarizes the length of time securities have been in an unrealized gain or loss position at december  market aggregate aggregate value as market unrealized of cost value gain loss basis fixed maturities securities with unrealized gains exceeding  at and for less than one year issues  more than one year issues less than  at  issues  securities with unrealized losses exceeding  at and for less than one year issues more than one year issues less than  at issues other stocks securities with unrealized gains exceeding  at and for less than one year issues more than one year issues less than  at issues securities with unrealized losses exceeding  at and for less than one year issue more than one year none less than  at issues when a decline in the value of a specific investment is considered to be other than temporary  a provision for impairment is charged to earnings accounted for as a realized loss and the cost basis of that investment is reduced 
the determination of whether unrealized losses are other than temporary requires judgment based on subjective as well as objective factors 
factors considered and resources used by management include a whether the unrealized loss is credit driven or a result of changes in market interest rates  b the extent to which market value is less than cost basis  c historical operating  balance sheet and cash flow data contained in issuer sec filings  d issuer news releases  e near term prospects for improvement in the issuer and or its industry  f industry research and communications with industry specialists  g third party research and credit rating reports  h internally generated financial models and forecasts  i discussions with issuer management  and j ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
based on its analysis of the factors enumerated above  management believes i afg will recover its cost basis in the securities with unrealized losses and ii that afg has the ability and intent to hold the securities until they mature or recover in value 
should either of these beliefs change with regard to a particular security  a charge for impairment would likely be required 
while it is not possible to accurately predict if or when a specific security will become impaired  charges for other than temporary impairment could be material to results of operations in a future period 
management believes it is not likely that future impairment charges will have a significant effect on afg s liquidity 
net realized gains losses on securities sold and charges for other than temporary impairment on securities held were as follows in millions net realized gains losses charges for on sales impairment other a total b a includes adjustments to carry derivatives at market and to reflect the impact of realized gains and losses on the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
b does not include million writedown of certain collateralized debt obligations which was recorded as the cumulative effect of an adoption of an accounting change at april  increased impairment charges in recent years reflect a rise in corporate defaults in the marketplace resulting from the weakened economy 
uncertainties as more fully explained in the following paragraphs  management believes that the areas posing the greatest risk of material loss are the adequacy of its insurance reserves and american premier s contingencies arising out of its former operations 
property and casualty insurance reserves the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses was as follows in millions december  specialty   personal other lines including asbestos and environmental the liabilities for unpaid claims and for expenses of investigation and adjustment of unpaid claims are based upon a the accumulation of case estimates for losses reported prior to the close of the accounting periods on direct business written  b estimates received from ceding reinsurers and insurance pools and associations  c estimates of unreported losses based on past experience  d estimates based on experience of expense for investigating and adjusting claims  and e the current state of law and coverage litigation 
using these items as well as historical trends adjusted for changes in underwriting standards  policy provisions  product mix and other factors  company actuaries determine a single or point estimate which management utilizes in recording its best estimate of the liabilities 
ranges of loss reserves are not developed by company actuaries 
estimating the liability for unpaid losses and lae is inherently judgmental and is influenced by factors which are subject to significant variation 
through the use of analytical reserve development techniques  management utilizes items such as the effect of inflation on medical  hospitalization  material  repair and replacement costs  general economic trends and the legal environment 
quarterly reviews of unpaid loss and lae reserves are prepared using standard actuarial techniques 
these may include case incurred development method  paid development method  bornhuetter ferguson method  and incremental paid lae to paid loss methods 
generally  data is segmented by major product or coverage within product using countrywide data  however  in some situations data may be reviewed by state for large volume states 
asbestos and environmental related a e reserves establishing reserves for a e claims relating to policies and participations in reinsurance treaties and former operations is subject to uncertainties that are significantly greater than those presented by other types of claims 
for this group of claims  traditional actuarial techniques that rely on historical loss development trends cannot be used 
case reserves and expense reserves are established by the claims department as specific policies are identified 
in addition to the case reserves established for known claims  management establishes additional reserves for claims not yet known or reported and for possible development on known claims 
these additional reserves are management s best estimate based on its review of industry trends and other industry information about such claims  with due consideration to individual claim situations like ap green 
estimating ultimate liability for asbestos claims presents a unique and difficult challenge to the insurance industry due to  among other things  inconsistent court decisions  an increase in bankruptcy filings as a result of asbestos related liabilities  novel theories of coverage  and judicial interpretations that often expand theories of recovery and broaden the scope of coverage 
the casualty insurance industry is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues as the volume and severity of claims against asbestos defendants continue to increase 
while management believes that afg s reserves for a e claims are a reasonable estimate of ultimate liability for such claims  actual results may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded due to the difficulty in predicting the number of future claims and the impact of recent bankruptcy filings  and unresolved issues such as whether coverage exists  whether policies are subject to aggregate limits on coverage  whether claims are to be allocated among triggered policies and implicated years  and whether claimants who exhibit no signs of illness will be successful in pursuing their claims 
in february  great american insurance company entered into an agreement for the settlement of asbestos related coverage litigation under insurance polices issued during the s and s to bigelow liptak corporation and related companies  subsequently known as ap green industries  inc ap green 
management believes that this settlement will enhance financial certainty and provides resolution to litigation that represents afg s largest known asbestos related claim and the only such claim that management believes to be material 
the settlement is for million great american has the option to pay in cash or over time with interest  all but million of which will be covered by reserves established prior to september   and anticipated reinsurance recoverables for this matter 
as a result  afg recorded a million pretax charge million after tax in the fourth quarter of the agreement allows up to of the settlement to be paid in afg common stock 
the settlement is subject to a number of contingencies  including the approval of the bankruptcy court supervising the reorganization of ap green and subsequent confirmation of a plan of reorganization that includes an injunction prohibiting the assertion against great american of any present or future asbestos personal injury claims under policies issued to ap green and related companies 
this process could take a year or more and no assurance can be made that all of these consents and approvals will be obtained  no payments are required until completion of the process 
if not obtained  the outcome of this litigation will again be subject to the complexities and uncertainties associated with a chapter proceeding and asbestos coverage litigation 
the payments  reserve balances and policy count information for asbestos  environmental and other mass torts were as follows dollars in millions net net amounts reserve policyholder counts paid in balance direct and assumed new closed asbestos environmental other mass tort total   of the open asbestos accounts  approximately are holders of policies written by afg subsidiaries and approximately represent assumed reinsurance business 
the direct policyholders with asbestos claims consist of limited exposures  dominated by small to mid sized commercial entities that are mostly regional policyholders with few national target defendants 
with respect to non products exposures  there are few accounts with potentially significant exposure  none of which is considered to be material to the company 
the assumed reinsurance business includes exposures for the periods to the asbestos and environmental assumed claims are ceded by various insurance companies under reinsurance treaties 
a majority of the individual assumed claims have exposures of less than  to afg 
asbestos losses assumed include some of the industry known manufacturers  distributors and installers 
pollution losses include industry known insured names and sites 
other mass tort losses include agent orange  breast implants  des  dalkon shield  lead  silicon and various chemical exposures 
exposure to market risk market risk represents the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
afg s exposures to market risk relate primarily to its investment portfolio and annuity contracts which are exposed to interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  equity price risk 
to a much lesser extent  afg s long term debt is also exposed to interest rate risk 
fixed maturity portfolio the fair value of afg s fixed maturity portfolio is directly impacted by changes in market interest rates 
afg s fixed maturity portfolio is comprised of substantially all fixed rate investments with primarily intermediate term maturities 
this practice allows flexibility in reacting to fluctuations of interest rates 
the portfolios of afg s insurance operations are managed with an attempt to achieve an adequate risk adjusted return while maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet policyholder obligations 
afg s life and annuity operations attempt to align the duration of their invested assets to the projected cash flows of policyholder liabilities 
the following table provides information about afg s fixed maturity investments at december  and  that are sensitive to interest rate risk 
the table shows principal cash flows in millions and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity date for each of the five subsequent years and for all years thereafter 
callable bonds and notes are included based on call date or maturity date depending upon which date produces the most conservative yield 
mortgage backed securities mbss and sinking fund issues are included based on maturity year adjusted for expected payment patterns 
actual cash flows may differ from those expected 
december  december  principal principal cash flows rate cash flows rate thereafter  thereafter  total   fair value   equity price risk equity price risk is the potential economic loss from adverse changes in equity security prices 
although afg s investment in other stocks is less than of total investments  two thirds of other stocks is invested in provident financial group which exposes afg to the risk of price declines in a single position 
included in other stocks at december  were warrants valued at million to purchase common stock of various companies 
under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 which was adopted as of october   these warrants are generally considered derivatives and marked to market through current earnings as realized gains and losses 
annuity contracts substantially all of gafri s fixed rate annuity contracts permit gafri to change crediting rates subject to minimum interest rate guarantees of to per annum as determined by applicable law enabling management to react to changes in market interest rates and maintain an adequate spread 
nonetheless  due to the sharp drop in interest rates in  gafri s spreads have narrowed and will likely continue to narrow through at least actuarial assumptions used to estimate dpac and annuity benefits  as well as gafri s ability to maintain spread  could be impacted if the current interest rate environment continues for an extended period and causes policyholder behavior to be altered 
projected payments in millions in each of the subsequent five years and for all years thereafter on gafri s fixed annuity liabilities at december were as follows 
fair first second third fourth fifth thereafter total value nearly half of gafri s fixed annuity liabilities at december   were two tier in nature in that policyholders can receive a higher amount if they annuitize rather than surrender their policy  even if the surrender charge period has expired 
at december   the average crediting rate on gafri s principal fixed annuity products was approximately and current stated crediting rates excluding bonus interest on gafri s active products generally range from to 
gafri estimates that its effective weighted average crediting rate over the next five years will approximate 
this rate reflects actuarial assumptions as to i expected investment spread  ii deaths  iii annuitizations  iv surrenders and v renewal premiums 
actual experience and changes in actuarial assumptions may result in different effective crediting rates than those above 
gafri s equity indexed fixed annuities provide policyholders with a crediting rate tied  in part  to the performance of an existing stock market index 
gafri attempts to mitigate the risk in the equity based component of these products through the purchase of call options on the appropriate index 
gafri s strategy is designed so that an increase in the liabilities due to an increase in the market index will be substantially offset by unrealized gains on the call options 
under sfas no 
 both the equity based component of the annuities and the related call options are considered derivatives and marked to market through current earnings as annuity benefits 
adjusting these derivatives to market value had a net effect of less than of annuity benefits in and in  gafri chose to suspend new sales of equity indexed annuities due primarily to lack of volume 
debt and preferred securities the following table shows scheduled principal payments in millions on fixed rate long term debt of afg and its subsidiaries and related weighted average interest rates for each of the subsequent five years and for all years thereafter 
december  december  scheduled scheduled principal principal payments rate payments rate thereafter thereafter total fair value less than million 
at december  and  respectively  afg and its subsidiaries had million and million in variable rate debt maturing primarily in through the weighted average interest rate on afg s variable rate debt was at december  compared to at december  there were million of subsidiary trust preferred securities with a weighted average interest rate of outstanding at december  and  none of which is scheduled for maturity or mandatory redemption during the next five years 
results of operations three years ended december  general results of operations as shown in the accompanying financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
many investors and analysts focus on core earnings of companies  setting aside certain items included in net earnings such as realized gains and losses  the cumulative effect of accounting changes and certain other unusual items 
realized gains and losses are excluded from core earnings because they are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals 
other items such as the asbestos litigation settlement and tax resolution benefits and the special a e charge and world trade center losses are excluded to assist investors in analyzing their impact on the trend in operating results 
nonetheless  these items are significant components of afg s overall financial results 
the following table shows afg s net earnings and diluted earnings per share as stated in the statement of operations as well as the after tax effect of other items included in these gaap measures that are typically excluded in deriving core earnings in millions  except per share amounts net earnings loss after tax income expense items included in net earnings asbestos litigation settlement tax resolution benefits a e charge and wtc losses net losses from investee corporations realized investment gains losses cumulative effect of accounting changes diluted per share amounts net earnings loss

in addition to the effects of items shown in the table above  net earnings increased in primarily due to significantly improved underwriting results and income from the sale of real estate  partially offset by reduced earnings in the annuity and life operations 
net earnings for and include goodwill amortization expense of million 
per share and million 
per share  respectively 
aside from the asbestos charges and losses from the world trade center  underwriting results improved in but were partially offset by a million charge to increase reserves for environmental costs related to certain former operations 
property and casualty insurance underwriting afg s property and casualty operations have consisted of two major business groups specialty and personal 
see note o  subsequent events  to the financial statements for a discussion of the sale of nearly all of the personal group 
the specialty group includes a highly diversified group of business lines 
some of the more significant areas are inland and ocean marine  california workers compensation  agricultural related coverages  executive and professional liability  fidelity and surety bonds  collateral protection  and umbrella and excess coverages 
the personal group sells nonstandard and preferred standard private passenger auto insurance and  to a lesser extent  homeowners insurance 
nonstandard automobile insurance covers risks not typically accepted for standard automobile coverage because of the applicant s driving record  type of vehicle  age or other criteria 
to understand the overall profitability of particular lines  the timing of claims payments and the related impact of investment income must be considered 
certain short tail lines of business primarily property coverages have quick loss payouts which reduce the time funds are held  thereby limiting investment income earned thereon 
on the other hand  long tail lines of business primarily liability coverages and workers compensation have payouts that are either structured over many years or take many years to settle  thereby significantly increasing investment income earned on related premiums received 
underwriting profitability is measured by the combined ratio which is a sum of the ratios of underwriting losses  loss adjustment expenses  underwriting expenses and policyholder dividends to premiums 
when the combined ratio is under  underwriting results are generally considered profitable  when the ratio is over  underwriting results are generally considered unprofitable 
the combined ratio does not reflect investment income  other income or federal income taxes 
for certain lines of business and products where the credibility of the range of loss projections is less certain primarily many of the various specialty businesses listed above  management believes that it is prudent and appropriate to use conservative assumptions until such time as the data  experience and projections have more credibility  as evidenced by data volume  consistency and maturity of the data 
while this practice mitigates the risk of adverse development on this business  it does not eliminate it 
while afg desires and seeks to earn an underwriting profit on all of its business  it is not always possible to do so 
as a result  afg attempts to expand in the most profitable areas and control growth or even reduce its involvement in the least profitable ones 
since mid  afg has been actively realigning its mix of business and resetting its rate structure with a goal of achieving underwriting profits  even if it entails sacrificing volume 
management believes these efforts have been successful and expects further improvement in underwriting profitability in resulting from these strategic actions 
afg s combined ratio has been better than the industry average for sixteen of the last seventeen years and excluding afg s special a e charges  for all seventeen years 
afg s insurance operations have performed better than the industry by focusing on growth opportunities in the more profitable areas of its specialty and nonstandard auto businesses 
net written premiums and combined ratios for afg s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries were as follows dollars in millions gross written premiums gaap specialty    personal    other lines net written premiums gaap specialty    personal a  a  other lines combined ratios gaap specialty b personal aggregate including discontinued lines c c a reflects the ceding of million and million in premiums in and  respectively under a reinsurance agreement effective april  b includes for relating to the attack on the world trade center 
c includes for relating to the ap green asbestos litigation charge and for relating to the a e charge and the attack on the world trade center 
as shown in note m under insurance reserves  afg s property and casualty operations recorded loss development of million in and million in related to prior accident years 
major areas of adverse development were as follows in millions asbestos executive liability other liability personal lines other discontinued specialty businesses other amounts are immaterial and included in other asbestos development was due primarily to charges for settlement of litigation and the special million a e charge  both of which are discussed below 
see uncertainties asbestos and environmental related reserves for additional information about these claims 
executive liability development resulted primarily from claim severity on policy coverages for and both settlement costs and defense costs related to shareholder lawsuits have increased beyond estimates 
other liability development was the result of an unexpected shift of the judicial climate in some previously relatively conservative states 
verdicts  judgments  and settlements have increased and reserves were adjusted accordingly 
in the personal lines  personal injury and uninsured motorist claims have experienced increased severity 
during  claims remained open longer and settlement amounts have been higher than in previous years 
development in the other discontinued specialty businesses related primarily to excess casualty and homebuilders product liability 
during  both experienced higher frequency of claims  primarily related to the and accident years for the excess casualty line  and through for the homebuilders liability 
development in  and to a lesser extent in  was affected by increased severity in excess casualty resulting from a rigorous claims review of case reserves established by former management 
other development represents an aggregation of all other lines 
while both increases and decreases occurred in these individual lines  none experienced development greater than the smallest listed in the table above 
aggregate adverse development in the other lines was approximately million in  and million in aggregate positive development was million in and million in asbestos litigation settlement charge as more fully discussed under uncertainties asbestos and environmental related reserves  afg recorded a fourth quarter pretax charge of million related to the settlement of asbestos related coverage litigation 
special a e charge during the third quarter of  afg recorded an a e charge of million after experiencing an increase in the number and severity of asbestos claims and observing the developments of adverse trends in the property and casualty insurance industry concerning asbestos losses 
this charge  accompanied by a transfer of million from excess reserves for other environmental claims  resulted in an increase of million in asbestos reserves 
for a discussion of uncertainties relative to asbestos and environmental claims  see uncertainties asbestos and environmental related reserves 
specialty the specialty group s gross written premiums increased in compared to  reflecting the effect of rate increases and the volume growth in certain businesses  partially offset by planned reductions in less profitable lines of business 
specialty rate increases averaged about during and are targeted to be or more going into net written premiums increased in compared to strong growth in gross written premiums was offset by the impact of expanding the personal group automobile physical damage reinsurance agreement discussed below to include several specialty business lines as well as increased reinsurance coverage in certain other lines

the specialty group s increase in gross and net written premiums in reflects the impact of rate increases implemented in and and the realization of growth opportunities in certain commercial markets  partially offset by the decision to discontinue certain lines of business that were not achieving adequate returns 
specialty rate increases averaged over in the improvement in the combined ratio compared to reflects the impact of rate increases and unusually strong results in several businesses

rate increases implemented in were approximately 
since april  afg has reinsured of the automobile physical damage business written by certain of its insurance subsidiaries 
in september  afg s use of the existing agreement was expanded to include physical damage business written through the agency channel of great american insurance pool companies 
this agreement enables afg to reallocate some of its capital to the more profitable specialty operations 
the decline in net written premiums in and reflects the impact of this reinsurance agreement 
due primarily to rate increases and a million reduction in marketing and media cost of the direct business  the personal group s combined ratio improved by points compared to more than of the personal group s business is written by the insurance operations included in the recent public offering of infinity property and casualty corporation 
business written through these operations achieved an underwriting profit with a combined ratio of for the personal group s gross written premiums declined about in compared to as lower business volume was partially offset by the impact of significant rate increases in and the group implemented rate increases of about in as a result of rate increases in and  the combined ratio improved to for life  accident and health premiums and benefits life  accident and health premiums and benefits increased in due primarily to the acquisition of manhattan national life mnl in june and increased in due primarily to the acquisition of a block of supplemental health insurance business in november in addition to these acquisitions  life  accident and health benefits for reflect the effects of adverse mortality in gafri s life insurance operations 
investment income changes in investment income reflect fluctuations in market rates and changes in average invested assets 
investment income increased in and due primarily to higher average investment in fixed maturity securities  partially offset by lower average yields on those investments

in  afg recognized i a million pretax gain representing an earn out related to the sale of its commercial lines division  ii a million pretax loss on the sale of stonewall insurance company and iii a million estimated pretax loss related to the agreement to sell its japanese division completed in 
gain on sale of other investments in september  afg realized a million pretax gain on the sale of its minority ownership in a residential homebuilding company 
in september  gafri realized a million pretax gain on the sale of its minority ownership in a company engaged in the production of ethanol 
gafri s investment was repurchased by the ethanol company which  following the purchase  became wholly owned by afg s chairman 
real estate operations afg s subsidiaries are engaged in a variety of real estate operations including hotels  apartments  office buildings and recreational facilities  they also own several parcels of land 
revenues and expenses of these operations  including gains and losses on disposal  are included in afg s statement of operations as shown below in millions 
other income other operating and general expenses interest charges on borrowed money minority interest expense  net other income includes net pretax gains on the sale of real estate assets of million in  million in and million in other income compared to other income increased million in due primarily to higher income from real estate operations including the effect of property sales and a hotel acquired in may  increased fees earned by the specialty group s new warranty business and higher fee income in certain other specialty insurance operations 
compared to other income declined in compared to due primarily to the absence of income from the sale of lease rights  lease residuals and other operating assets 
annuity benefits for gaap financial reporting purposes  annuity receipts are accounted for as interest bearing deposits annuity benefits accumulated rather than as revenues 
under these contracts  policyholders funds are credited with interest on a tax deferred basis until withdrawn by the policyholder 
annuity benefits reflect amounts accrued on annuity policyholders funds accumulated 
the rate at which gafri credits interest on most of its annuity policyholders funds is subject to change based on management s judgment of market conditions 
historically  management has been able to react to changes in market interest rates and maintain a desired interest rate spread 
the recent interest rate environment has resulted in spread compression which could continue at least through in  annuity benefits also includes a second quarter charge of million related to the settlement of a policyholder class action lawsuit 
on its deferred annuities annuities in the accumulation phase  gafri generally credits interest to policyholders accounts at their current stated surrender interest rates 
furthermore  for two tier deferred annuities annuities under which a higher interest amount can be earned if a policy is annuitized rather than surrendered  gafri accrues an additional liability to provide for expected deaths and annuitizations 
changes in crediting rates  actual surrender  death and annuitization experience or modifications in actuarial assumptions can affect this accrual 
in  this accrual was reduced by approximately million due to decreases in crediting rates on certain fixed annuity products  partially offset by a modification in projected investment yields

interest on borrowed money changes in interest expense result from fluctuations in market rates as well as changes in borrowings 
afg has generally financed its borrowings on a long term basis which has resulted in higher current costs 
compared to interest expense was virtually unchanged in as lower average rates on afg s variable rate debt were substantially offset by higher average indebtedness and higher average payable to reinsurers balances

the initial impairment testing resulted in a charge of million net of minority interest and taxes for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in  the cumulative effect of accounting change represents the implementation of a new accounting standard eitf which resulted in a writedown of million net of minority interest and taxes of the carrying value of certain collateralized debt obligations as of april  in october  afg implemented statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires all derivatives to be recognized in the balance sheet at fair value and that the initial effect of recognizing derivatives at fair value be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
accordingly  afg recorded a charge of million net of minority interest and taxes to record its derivatives at fair value at the beginning of the fourth quarter of recent accounting standards the following accounting standards have been or may be implemented by afg 
the implementation of these standards is discussed under various subheadings of note a to the financial statements  effects of each are shown in the relevant notes 
accounting standard subject of standard year implemented reference sfas derivatives derivatives eitf asset backed securities investments sfas business combinations business combinations sfas goodwill and other intangibles goodwill sfas stock based compensation stock based compensation other standards issued in recent years did not apply to afg or had only negligible effects on afg 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no  consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation will require companies to consolidate entities without sufficient equity based on ownership of expected gains and losses 
fin is effective immediately to variable interest entities acquired after january  for entities acquired before that date  the guidance becomes effective for periods beginning after june  afg is currently assessing the application of fin as it relates to its investments in two collateralized debt obligations cdos  for which afg also acts as investment manager 
under the cdos  securities were issued in various senior and subordinate classes and the proceeds were invested primarily in bank loans  and to a lesser extent  high yield bonds  all of which serve as collateral for the securities issued by the cdos 
none of the collateral was purchased from afg 
the market value of the collateral at december  was approximately million 
afg s investments in the two cdos are subordinate to the senior classes approximately of the total securities issued by the cdos 
to the extent there are defaults and unrecoverable losses on the underlying collateral resulting in reduced cash flows  afg s class would bear losses first 
holders of the cdo debt securities have no recourse against afg for the liabilities of the cdos  accordingly  afg s exposure to loss on these investments is limited to its investment 
afg s investments in the cdos are carried at estimated market value of million at december  and are included in fixed maturities in afg s balance sheet 
proposed accounting standard gafri s variable annuity contracts contain a guaranteed minimum death benefit gmdb which may exceed the value of the policyholder s account to be paid if the annuityholder dies before the annuity payout period commences 
at december   the aggregate gmdb values assuming every policyholder died on that date exceeded the market value of the underlying variable annuities by million 
industry practice varies  but gafri does not establish gaap reserves for this mortality risk 
if a proposed accounting standard becomes effective  gafri would be required to record a liability for the present value of expected gmdb payments 
initial recognition of a gaap liability estimated to be less than of the difference between the underlying market value of thevariable annuities and gmdb value would be accounted for as the cumulativeeffect of a change in accounting principles 
death benefits paid in excess of the variable annuity account balances were million in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information required by item a is included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
