item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview we offer products and services as either integrated systems or individual components primarily through three business lines traditional production equipment and services  through which we provide standardized components  replacement parts and used components and equipment servicing  engineered systems  through which we provide customized  large scale integrated oil  gas and water production and processing systems  and automation and control systems  through which we provide control panels and systems that monitor and control oil and gas production  as well as repair  testing and inspection services for existing systems 
we report three separate business segments north american operations  engineered systems and automation and control systems 
in january  we completed our initial public offering of common stock  resulting in the issuance of  shares of common stock with net proceeds of million 
in july  we changed our presentation of certain assets that were acquired from the cynara company in november  and the related operating results  for segment reporting purposes 
the majority of the assets were reclassified to the north american operations business segment from the engineered systems business segment 
this change has been retroactively reflected in all periods presented

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the results reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
note to our consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition percentage of completion method 
we recognize revenues from significant contracts contracts greater than  and longer than four months in duration and certain automation and controls contracts and orders on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
earned revenue is based on the percentage that costs incurred to date relate to total estimated costs of the project  after giving effect to the most recent estimates of total cost 
the timing of costs incurred  and therefore recognition of revenue  could be affected by various internal or external factors including  but not limited to changes in project scope change orders  changes in productivity  scheduling  the cost and availability of labor  the cost an availability of raw materials  the weather  client delays in providing approvals at benchmark stages of the project and the timing of deliveries from third party providers of key components 
the cumulative impact of revisions in total cost estimates during the progress of work is reflected in the period in which these changes become known 
earned revenue reflects the original contract price adjusted for agreed claims and change order revenues  if applicable 
losses expected to be incurred on the jobs in progress  after consideration of estimated probable minimum recoveries from claims and change orders  are charged to income as soon as such losses are known 
claims for additional contract revenue are recognized if it is probable that the claim will result in additional revenue and the amount can be reliably estimated 
we generally recognize revenue and earnings to which the percentage of completion method applies over a period of two to six quarters 
in the event a project is terminated by our customer before completion  our customer is liable for costs incurred under the contract 
we believe that our operating results should be evaluated over a term of several years to evaluate our performance under long term contracts  after all change orders  scope changes and cost recoveries have been negotiated and realized 
we record revenues and profits on all other sales as shipments are made or services are performed 
impairment testing goodwill 
as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we evaluate goodwill annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of operating assets to the carrying value of those assets  including any related goodwill 
as required by sfas no 
 we identify separate reportable units for purposes of this evaluation 
in determining carrying value  we segregate assets and liabilities that  to the extent possible  are clearly identifiable by specific reportable unit 
all inter company receivables payables are excluded 
certain corporate and other assets and liabilities  that are not clearly identifiable by specific reportable unit  are allocated based on the ratio of each unit s net assets relative to total net assets 
the fair value is then compared to the carrying value of the reportable unit to determine whether or not impairment has occurred at the reportable unit level 
in the event an impairment is indicated  an additional test is performed whereby an implied fair value of goodwill is determined through an allocation of the fair value to the reporting unit s assets and liabilities  whether recognized or unrecognized  in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
any residual fair value after this purchase price allocation would be assumed to relate to goodwill 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded the residual fair value  we would record an impairment charge for that amount 
net goodwill was million at december  no impairment charge was recorded as of december  acquisitions in november  we acquired all the outstanding common stock of the cynara company cynara  a designer and manufacturer of specialized production equipment utilizing membrane technology to separate bulk carbon dioxide from natural gas streams  for approximately million   shares of our common stock and the right to receive additional shares of common stock based upon the financial performance of the cynara assets 
ultimately  we issued  additional shares  as class b common stock  which was converted to class a common stock  on a share for share basis  prior to december  in january  we acquired all the outstanding common stock of porta test international  inc porta test  a manufacturer of centrifugal devices used to enhance the effectiveness of separation equipment  for approximately million and the right to receive additional payments based upon the performance of certain porta test assets 
see commitments and contingencies 
in february  we acquired all the outstanding common stock of modular production equipment  inc mpe  a designer and manufacturer of water treatment separation systems specializing in hydro cyclone technology  for approximately million 
in april  we acquired all the outstanding common stock of engineering specialties inc esi  a provider of proprietary technologies for oily water treatment and heavy metals removal from production at or near the wellhead  for approximately million 
in march  we acquired all the outstanding share capital of axsia  a privately held process and design company based in the united kingdom  for approximately million  net of cash acquired 
axsia specializes in the design and supply of equipment for water re injection systems for oil and gas fields  oily water treatment  oil separation  hydrogen production and other oil and gas processing equipment systems 
this acquisition was financed with borrowings under our term loan and revolving credit facility 
we accounted for each of the above transactions using the purchase method of accounting 
industry and business environment as a leading provider of wellhead process equipment  systems and services used in the production of oil and gas  our revenues and results of operations are closely tied to demand for oil and gas products and spending by oil and gas companies for exploration and development of oil and gas reserves 
these companies generally invest more in exploration and development efforts during periods of favorable oil and gas commodity prices  and invest less during periods of unfavorable oil and gas prices 
as supply and demand change  commodity prices fluctuate producing cyclical trends in the industry 
during periods of lower demand  revenues for service providers such as natco generally decline  as existing projects are completed and new projects are postponed 
during periods of recovery  revenues for service providers can lag behind the industry due to the timing of new project awards 
changes in commodity prices have impacted our business over the past several years 
the following table summarizes the price of domestic crude oil per barrel and the wellhead price of natural gas per thousand cubic feet mcf  as published by the us department of energy  and the number of rotary drilling rigs in operation  as published by baker hughes incorporated  for the most recent five years year ended december  average price of crude oil per barrel in the us average wellhead price of natural gas per mcf in the us average us rig us  average wellhead price of natural gas per mcf in the us for the period january  through november  at december   the spot price of west texas intermediate crude oil was per barrel  the price of natural gas was per mcf  and the us rig count was at february   the spot price of west texas intermediate crude oil was per barrel  the price of henry hub natural gas was per mcf  as per the new york mercantile exchange  and the us rig count was  per baker hughes incorporated 
these spot prices reflect the overall volatility of oil and gas commodity prices in the current and recent years 
although increased commodity prices generally correlate directly with an increase in spending by oil and gas companies for exploration and development efforts  rig counts remain lower than expected based on historical experience 
from a longer term perspective  the us department of energy estimates that us demand for petroleum products will grow at an average annual rate of through and that us demand for natural gas will increase at an average annual rate of through as demand grows and reserves in the united states decline  producers and service providers in the oil and gas industry may continue to rely more heavily on global sources of energy and expansion into new markets 
the industry continues to seek more innovative and technologically efficient means to extract hydrocarbons from existing fields  as production profiles change 
as a result  additional and more complex equipment may be required to produce oil and gas from these fields  especially since many new oil and gas fields produce lower quality or contaminated hydrocarbon streams  requiring more complex production equipment 
in general  these trends should increase the demand for our products and services 
the following discussion of our historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

as a percentage of revenue  gross margins for the segment were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross profit from our engineered systems business segment for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december   despite an increase in revenues 
this decline was due to the completion of several high margin projects during in southeast asia and within our uk based operations  partially offset by new projects for awarded at more traditional margins 
as a percentage of revenue  gross margins for this segment were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross profit from our automation and control systems business segment for the years ended december  and remained constant  despite a increase in revenues for the period  primarily due to an increase in labor costs attributable to higher medical benefit costs and an unfavorable mix of labor and materials in compared to as a percentage of revenue  gross margins for this segment were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was largely related to the following factors one year of operating expenses at axsia during compared to nine months during fiscal  additional costs associated with the start up of the singapore office in march  costs associated with the start up of the mexico marketing office opened in late  and additional costs associated with employee medical claims

amortization expense for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to  from million for the year ended december  this decrease in amortization expense was attributable to a change in accounting method prescribed by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this pronouncement  adopted on january   requires that goodwill no longer be amortized over a prescribed period but rather intangible assets not assigned a useful life be evaluated annually for impairment 
see recent accounting pronouncements 
therefore  no goodwill amortization was recorded for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  in addition  the results for the year ended december  include amortization expense associated with certain employment contracts that were fully amortized as of december  closure and other 
closure and other charges for the year ended december  of  related to the closure of a manufacturing and engineering facility in edmonton  alberta  canada

as of december item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operations are conducted around the world in a number of different countries 
accordingly  our earnings are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the majority of our foreign currency transactions relate to operations in canada and the uk at natco canada  most contracts are denominated in canadian dollars  and most of the costs incurred are in canadian dollars  thereby mitigating risks associated with currency fluctuations 
at axsia  which is our uk based operation acquired in march  many contracts are denominated in us dollars  and occasionally in euros  whereas most of the costs may be in british pounds sterling 
consequently  we have some currency risk in our uk operations 
prior to the date of acquisition  axsia had entered into certain forward contract arrangements whereby it sold us dollars for future delivery at a specified strike price  in order to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations on contracts denominated in us dollars 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we paid approximately  to terminate these forward contracts 
no forward contracts or other derivative arrangements existed at december   and we do not currently intend to enter into new forward contracts or other derivative arrangements as part of our currency risk management strategy 
our financial instruments are subject to changes in interest rates  including our revolving credit and term loan facility  our working capital facility for export sales and our long term facility secured by our magnolia manufacturing plant 
at december   we had million outstanding under the term loan portion of the revolving credit and term loan facility 
at december   outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement totaled million 
borrowings under our revolving credit agreement bear interest at floating rates 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate of borrowings under the revolving credit and term loan facility was 
borrowings outstanding under the export sales credit facility were million at december   and bore interest at 
borrowing under the long term arrangement secured by our magnolia manufacturing facility totaled million at december   and accrued interest at 
based on past market movements and possible near term market movements  we do not believe that potential near term losses in future earnings  fair values or cash flows from changes in interest rates are likely to be material 
assuming our current level of borrowings  as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates under these borrowings would decrease our current year net income and cash flow from operations by approximately  this calculation assumes no action on our part to mitigate our exposure 
furthermore  this calculation does not consider the effects of a possible change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment
