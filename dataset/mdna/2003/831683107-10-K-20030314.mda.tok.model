table of contents broadline foodservice sales increased in as compared to  due to increased cruise line sales at florida foodservice 
such increase was partially offset by decreased sales at smart final foodservice  and the adverse affect of the events of september  and resultant decreased travel patterns as well as the general economic downturn 
gross margin as a percentage of sales  gross margin was in  in and in gross margins decreased in as compared to due to decreased gross margins at stores  partially offset by improvement at broadline foodservice and a favorable mix as a result of the shift to stores sales as broadline foodservice sales fell 
gross margin improved in from due to improved gross margins at stores and the improved sales mix 
stores gross margins as a percentage of sales for the stores segment were in  in and in gross margins  as a percentage of sales  for stores decreased in primarily due to increased occupancy costs as a result of the increased number of new and relocated stores opened during and  and increased inventory loss reported in the early part of the year

table of contents gross margins  as a percentage of sales  for broadline foodservice decreased in primarily due to higher costs at smart final foodservice  including the costs of re racking its facilities  restructuring its operations  inventory shrink and increased occupancy costs  changes in sales mix due to the increased cruise line sales that generate lower margins  and decreased distribution expense allocated to stores due to a change in the basis of allocating such expenses in operating and administrative expenses operating and administrative expenses were of sales in  in  and in stores operating and administrative expense increases for stores in and were attributable to increased store labor in support of the program to improve service and support sales  increased store operating expenses as a result of a greater number of new and relocated stores opened during and  increased utility costs  credit card fees and increased marketing expense  and increased fringe benefit costs  including pension costs  workers compensation insurance and medical insurance 
these increases were partially offset by the continued control in other expenditures  primarily reductions in performance based compensation 
foodservice operating and administrative expenses increased at broadline foodservice in primarily due to increased operating expenses at smart final foodservice despite its reduced selling expenses and provision for bad debts 
expenses in increased  despite continuing rigid expense controls at florida foodservice  due to the costs related to restructuring smart final foodservice  increased selling expenses in an effort to create new sales  and increased provision for bad debts 
corporate expense corporate expense increased in  due to a million pre tax charge reflecting the costs associated with the settlement of a contractual dispute with a vendor and increased professional fees  partially offset by increased gain recognized on the sale of unused property 
the decrease in corporate expenses in was primarily due to non recurring consulting fees of million incurred in related to improving procurement programs 
no similar consulting 
table of contents fees were recorded in the same period of additionally in  we recorded a million gain related to the distributions received from an insurance company demutualization transaction 
interest expense  net interest expense  net increased in to million  compared to million in and million in interest expense  net increased in due to the higher average outstanding debt levels  partially offset by decreased average interest rates

equity earnings in unconsolidated subsidiary smart final mexico owns a interest in a mexico joint venture that operates nine stores in mexico and produced million in equity earnings in  million in and million in this mexico joint venture opened three new stores during the last three years 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows and financial positions net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in and million in the increase or decrease in cash provided by operating activities reflects our operating performance and the timing of receipts and disbursements 
in  as compared to  decreases in trade notes and accounts receivable and inventories and an increase in other accrued liabilities were partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued salaries and wages as well as an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in and million in the increases in and  as compared to  were primarily due to capital expenditure requirements for an increased number of new and relocated stores 
capital expenditures for totaled million  which consisted of million in support of the stores segment and million in support of the broadline foodservice segment 
for  capital expenditures totaled million  which consisted of million in support of the stores segment and million in support of the broadline foodservice segment 
these increases in capital expenditures were partially offset by increased proceeds from disposal of closed or relocated store properties in and net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to million net cash provided by financing activities in and million net cash used in financing activities in net cash used in financing activities in primarily reflected payments on notes and capital leases 
net cash provided by financing activities increased in primarily due to the refinancing activities in november that provided the additional net cash 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  stockholders equity of million and debt  excluding capital leases  of million 
the debt consists 
table of contents of million outstanding under a revolving bank credit facility and a million remaining balance under a five year unsecured note as a result of the acquisition of cash carry stores in the weighted average interest rate  including all associated fees  on our variable rate debt for was 
our working capital was a million deficit at december  compared to a positive working capital position of million at december  the million decrease in working capital was primarily the result of reclassification of the million outstanding borrowings under a revolving bank credit facility from long term liability to short term liability 
further discussion regarding this reclassification is included in bank credit facility  lease facility and other financing activities below 
capital expenditure and other capital requirements our primary requirement for capital is the financing of the building  leasehold improvements  equipment and initial set up expenditures for new  relocated and remodeled stores as well as general working capital requirements 
we estimate that new capital expenditures for will aggregate approximately million  including million in support of the stores segment and million in support of the broadline foodservice segment 
however  we cannot assure that these estimates will be realized and our capital program plans are subject to change upon our further review 
on average during the past three years  each new and relocated store cost approximately  in buildings and improvements and required approximately  and  for equipment and inventory  respectively 
remodel costs over the past three years have averaged approximately million each year or approximately  per store remodel 
the primary objective of remodelings is to improve the profitability of the stores by increasing sales and generating increased margins 
we have various retirement plans  which subject us to various funding obligations 
our noncontributory pension plan covers substantially all of our full time employees  except for those employees of our broadline foodservice segment 
we fund this plan with contributions as required by the employee retirement income security act of recent changes in the benefit plan assumptions as well as the funded status of the plan have impacted the funding and expense levels for fiscal year and future periods 
we contributed million to the plan in and estimate that these changes may require further cash contributions to the plan of approximately million to million by fiscal year end additionally  we recognized an additional minimum liability for the pension plan at fiscal year end  which resulted in a non cash charge to other comprehensive loss of million  net of tax 
bank credit facility  lease facility and other financing activities in november  we entered into a million three year senior secured revolving credit facility credit agreement with a syndicate of banks 
at our option  the credit agreement can be used to support up to million of commercial letters of credit 
availability under the credit agreement is subject to a formula based on the value of eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
as of december   million of revolving loan

interest for the credit agreement is at eurodollar libor or the administrative agent s reference rate  plus designated amounts 
commitment fees are charged on the undrawn amounts at rates ranging between to 
the credit agreement expires on november  principal repayments may be required prior to the final maturity 
additionally  under certain conditions  pay downs toward the facility are treated as permanent reductions to the amount committed 
as of december   the six month eurodollar libor rate was 
in november  we entered into a five year operating lease agreement lease agreement with a national banking association 
participants in this transaction include several banks and financing institutions as well as casino usa  inc casino usa which owned percent of our common stock at fiscal year end casino usa s share of participation is million 
the lease agreement  with a value of million and an interest rate of  covers leased properties 
the lease agreement provides for the financing of the following three distribution facilities a commerce  california warehouse for dry goods distribution to stores  b stockton  california  a dry goods warehouse for smart final foodservice distribution and stores  and c miami  florida  a frozen foods warehouse for florida foodservice distribution and stores  and for store locations 
the lease agreement expires on november  at the end of the term  the lease agreement requires us to elect to purchase all the properties by a final payment of million or sell all the properties to a third party 
if the properties are sold to a third party and the aggregate sales price is less than million  we are obligated to pay the difference of the aggregate sales price and million 
the aggregate minimum future lease payments  including the final obligation of million under the lease agreement  along with our other lease obligations  are included in the total contractual obligations in the table below and under note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
both the credit agreement and the lease agreement contain various customary and restrictive covenants  including restrictions on cash dividends declared or paid and additional debt and capital expenditures  and require us to maintain certain fixed charge coverage ratios and other financial ratios under each agreement 
the covenants do not require us to maintain a public debt rating or a certain liquidity level 
as of december   we were not in compliance with certain of these financial covenants 
in february  we obtained waivers of non compliance as of december  and an amendment of certain covenants for the first quarter of we intend to negotiate and enter into an amended credit agreement and lease agreement during pending the execution of an amended credit agreement  our obligation under the revolving credit facility has been classified as a current liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  if we are unable to negotiate and enter into an amended credit agreement and lease agreement  we may be required to renegotiate the terms of the waivers or seek alternative means of financing such obligations 
additionally  we may negotiate and restructure the lease agreement in response to the new accounting requirements contained in interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities released by the financial accounting standards board fasb in january see related discussion in new accounting pronouncements below 

table of contents historically  our primary source of liquidity has been cash flows from operations 
additionally  we have availability under bank credit facilities 
we expect to be able to fund future acquisitions and other cash requirements by a combination of available cash  cash from operations and other borrowings and proceeds from the issuance of equity securities 
we believe that our sources of funds are adequate to provide for working capital  capital expenditures  and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our future contractual obligations  dollars in thousands less than one year thereafter total long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases other long term obligations total contractual obligations inflation our primary costs  merchandise and labor  as well as utility and transportation costs are affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control 
these factors include the price of merchandise and fuel  the competitive climate  and the general and regional economic conditions 
as is common practice within the food industry  we have generally been able to maintain margins by adjusting selling prices and through procurement efficiencies 
but competitive conditions may  from time to time  render us unable to do so while maintaining or increasing our market share 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations which addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement cost 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases  and technical corrections 
sfas no 
requires most gains and losses on extinguishment of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than as extraordinary items as previously required 
sfas no 
also amends sfas no 
to require certain lease modifications to be treated as sale leaseback transactions 
certain provisions of sfas no 
are effective for transactions occurring after may   while other provisions are effective for fiscal years beginning after may  we do not expect a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition as a result of the adoption of sfas no 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities which requires the recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we do not expect a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
interpretation no 
requires that a guarantor recognize a liability for the fair value of guarantee obligations issued after december  we will record the fair value of future material guarantees  if any 
on january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
the objective of interpretation no 
is to improve financial reporting by companies involved with variable interest entities 
interpretation no 
changes certain consolidation requirements by requiring a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements apply to entities created before february   no later than the beginning of the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  under interpretation no 
 as it is currently structured  the assets and debt underlying the lease agreement would need to be consolidated 
we may negotiate and restructure the lease agreement in response to the new accounting requirements under interpretation no 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported assets  liabilities  sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that require the most subjective and complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following are considered our most critical accounting policies that  under different conditions or using different assumption or estimates  could show materially different results on our financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable and determine the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on analysis of historical trends of write offs and recoveries on various levels of aged receivables 
when we become aware of the deteriorated collectibility of a specific account  additional reserves are made to reduce the net recognized receivables to the amount reasonably expected to be collectible or zero 
when the specific account is determined uncollectible  the net recognized receivables are written off in its entirety against such reserves 

table of contents inventory we record the majority of our inventories at the lower of fifo first in  first out cost or market method 
approximately of our inventories are held at the stores and the remaining are held in our various warehouse locations 
these inventories are subject to frequent periodic counting 
losses  including theft  damages and other casualties are written off when identified 
reserves for inventory losses are provided based on analysis of historical trends including the results from the most recent periodic counting 
we evaluate the adequacy of these reserves every four week period 
goodwill sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that we test goodwill for impairment based on a comparison of fair values to the carrying values of our reporting units 
the determination of fair values of reporting units involves the use of assumptions and estimates such as the future performance of the operations of the reporting units and discount rates for determining the current values of expected future cash flows 
any change in these assumptions and estimates may cause the fair values of our operating units to decrease significantly and hence affect our results of operations and financial condition 
self insurance program we maintain a self insurance program covering the majority of our california workers compensation costs and deductibles 
the amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured 
we maintain insured deductible programs for other workers compensation and general liability exposures 
amounts in excess of deductibles are fully insured 
self insurance accruals are calculated by outside actuaries and are based on claims filed and include estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported 
projections of future loss are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ significantly from these assumptions and historical trends 
pension plans we maintain defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans for our employees 
the defined benefit pension plans pay benefits to employees at retirement using formulas based on various estimates and assumptions 
we account for the defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
employer s accounting for pensions 
sfas no 
requires that the amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis and include assumptions such as the expected rate of return on plan assets  a discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits and the rate of increase in future compensation levels 
any change in these assumptions may cause the future pension and postretirement benefit expenses to increase or decrease significantly and hence affect our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents contingencies and litigation in the ordinary course of our business  we are periodically named as a defendant in various lawsuits  claims and pending actions 
the principal risks that we insure against are workers compensation  general liability  automobile liability  property damage  alternative staffing errors and omissions  fiduciary liability and fidelity losses 
if a potential loss arising from these lawsuits  claims and actions is probable and reasonably estimable  we record the estimated liability based on circumstances and assumptions existing at the time 
whereas we believe the recorded liabilities are adequate  there are inherent limitations in the estimation process whereby future actual losses may exceed projected losses  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
off balance sheet financing the lease agreement mentioned above could generally be described as an off balance sheet financing activity 
this agreement currently qualifies for operating lease accounting treatment under sfas no  accounting for leases  and  as such  the buildings and improvements  and the debt incurred to construct them  are not included on our balance sheet 
accounting policies related to such practices have changed by the issuance of fasb interpretation no 
the discussion of these changes and their impact in the future is included under new accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and the exchange rate between the us dollar and mexican peso 
our financial risk management objective is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate fluctuations on our earnings and cash flows 
as of fiscal year end  our exposure to foreign exchange rates was limited 
additionally  we are exposed to the market fluctuations associated with stock we received as a result of the demutualization transactions of a mutual insurance company in december at december   the fair market value of the stock was million 
interest rate risk is managed through the use of an interest rate collar agreement to limit the effect of interest rate fluctuations on principal amounts of an aggregate of million in floating rate debt 
this agreement was entered into with a major financial institution thereby minimizing risk of credit loss 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a more complete description of our interest rate collar 
interest rate sensitivity analysis the following analysis presents our earnings sensitivity if a certain interest rate change occurred at december  the change chosen for this analysis reflects our view of a change that is reasonably possible over a one year period 
these forward looking disclosures are selective in nature and only address the potential impact from financial instruments 
they do not include other potential effects that could impact our business as a result of these changes in interest 

table of contents at december   we had debt  excluding capital leases totaling million  of which million was variable rate debt and million was fixed rate debt 
we also had an interest rate collar agreement with a notional value of million 
this interest rate collar agreement limits libor fluctuations to interest rate ranges from to and expires in november as of december   the six month eurodollar libor rate was 
holding other variables constant  such as debt levels  the earnings  net of taxes and cash flows impact of a one percentage point change in interest rates would be approximately million 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk on trade notes and accounts receivable 
we provide credit primarily to foodservice distribution customers in the ordinary course of business and perform ongoing credit evaluations 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade notes and accounts receivable are limited due to the number of customers comprising our customer base 
we currently believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover customer credit risks 
foreign currency risk our exposure to foreign currency risk is limited to the operations under smart final mexico and the equity earnings in its mexico joint venture 
at fiscal year end  such exposure was the million net investment in smart final mexico  which was comprised primarily of the mexico joint venture 
our other transactions are conducted in us dollars and are not exposed to fluctuation in foreign currency 
we do not hedge our foreign currency exposure and therefore are not exposed to such hedging risk
