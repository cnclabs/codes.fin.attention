item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to the historical information contained in this document  the discussion in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  made pursuant to the private securities litigation reform act of  that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of teradyne s plans  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form k should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements whenever they appear in this annual report on form k 
teradyne s actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these and any other forward looking statements 
factors that could contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those cautionary statements and other factors set forth in certain factors that may affect future results and elsewhere herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates teradyne has identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding its business and its results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on its business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect its reported and expected financial results 
preparation of financial statements and use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires teradyne to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  teradyne evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventories  investments  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets  bad debts  income taxes  pensions  warranties  contingencies and litigation 
teradyne bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  title and risk of loss have passed  delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
it is teradyne s policy to require an arrangement with its customers  either in the form of a written or electronic contract or purchase order containing all of the terms and conditions governing the arrangement  prior to the recognition of revenue 
title and risk of loss generally passes to the customer at the time of delivery of the product to a common carrier 
at the time of the transaction  teradyne assesses whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based upon the payment terms of the arrangement 
if a significant portion of the sales price is not due within normal payment terms  the sales price may not be deemed fixed and revenue would be recognized as the amounts become due 
teradyne does not offer a right of return on its products 
teradyne assesses collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction and collection history with a customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
teradyne performs on going credit evaluations of its customer s financial condition but generally does not require collateral from its customers 
if teradyne determines that collectibility of the sales price is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until such time as collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment from the customer 
revenue is recognized upon delivery provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment 
where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment  or in the case of new products  revenue is deferred until acceptance has been received 
for multiple element arrangements  teradyne defers the greater of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract or the portion of the sales price which is not payable until the undelivered elements are delivered 
teradyne also defers the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance  which represents deferred profit 
fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately 
in order to recognize revenue the functionality of the undelivered elements must not be essential to the delivered elements 
installation is not considered essential to the functionality of the product as these services do not alter the product capabilities  do not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors 
in addition to installation  other elements may include extended warranties  customer support and undelivered products 
service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed 
teradyne s products are generally subject to warranty and related costs are provided for in cost of sales when product revenue is recognized 
interconnection systems and electronic manufacturing assembly services revenue is recognized upon shipment or delivery according to the shipping terms of the arrangement as there is no installation required and there are no contractual acceptance requirements 
for certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under statement of accounting position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method based upon an efforts expended method 
these arrangements require significant production  modification or customization 
in all cases  changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which determined 
to date revenue under contract accounting has not been material 
inventories inventories which include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or net realizable value 
on a quarterly basis  teradyne uses consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventory for net realizable value 
teradyne records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory when such a writedown is identified through the quarterly review process 
the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand  product mix and possible alternative uses 
income taxes on a quarterly basis  teradyne evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance 
as a result of its review undertaken at december   teradyne concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a full valuation allowance 
until an appropriate level of profitability is reached  teradyne does not expect to recognize tax benefits on operating losses in future results of operations 
goodwill  intangible and long lived assets teradyne assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors teradyne considers important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of teradyne s use of the acquired asset  a change in the strategy for teradyne s overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when teradyne determines that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  teradyne measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks 
teradyne assesses goodwill for impairment at least annually  on a reporting basis  or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
allowance for doubtful accounts the volatility of the industries that teradyne serves can cause certain of its customers to experience shortages of cash flows  which can impact their ability to make required payments 
teradyne maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
estimated allowances for doubtful accounts are reviewed periodically taking into account the customer s current payment history  the customer s current financial statements and other information regarding the customer s credit worthiness 
if the financial condition of teradyne s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required

net sales growth slowed to in the third quarter followed by flat quarter to quarter performance in the fourth quarter 
the combination of a continued weak economy  weak demand for technology products  and the uncertain world political environment overwhelmed the recovery that appeared to be starting early in the year 
as of the end of  teradyne s customers in general have lowered their inventory levels and reduced their overall cost structures  resulting in improved quarterly financial performance 
additionally  utilization of teradyne s semiconductor test equipment  and semiconductor test equipment in general  has increased over the last year 
this has resulted from increased volumes of units shipped by teradyne s semiconductor industry customers 
these are generally signs of potential increases in demand for teradyne s products 
however  a number of teradyne s customers continue to lose money  although at a reduced rate 
in the semiconductor industry  this is occurring as decreased unit prices have offset the unit volume gains 
as a result  teradyne s customers continue to defer orders until the last possible moment 
until teradyne s customers see significant and sustained increases in their business levels  both in units and dollars  teradyne s orders could remain low or see a further decline 
if teradyne sees further declines in its own order rates  the amount of teradyne s inventory and certain long lived assets considered realizable could be significantly reduced 
bookings net orders increased to million in from million in net orders increased by and in semiconductor test systems and circuit board test and inspection systems  respectively 
connection systems net orders decreased by 
the increase in semiconductor orders was driven by increased demand for soc products by teradyne s integrated device manufacturers idms and subcon customers  primarily for use in asian facilities 
the increase in orders for circuit board test and inspection largely resulted from the full year impact of the genrad acquisition 
the decrease in connection system orders reflects the impact of cancellations  which are described in the next paragraph 
other test systems net orders increased  mostly due to the addition of a full year of activity from diagnostic solutions that was part of the genrad acquisition 
teradyne experienced cancellations of million and million during and  respectively 
for  cancellations of million and million occurred in the semiconductor test systems and connection system businesses  respectively 
the semiconductor test systems cancellations were largely for orders that were booked in late and early by subcons in anticipation of further increases in their own demand 
cancellations in the connection systems business were from major customers in the telecommunication and information technology infrastructure industries  as their own demand levels dropped 
teradyne s net orders for its four principal operating segments for and were as follows in millions semiconductor test systems connection systems circuit board test and inspection systems other test systems teradyne s net bookings by region as a percentage of total net bookings were as follows united states south east asia

during the year ended december   an excess and obsolete inventory provision of million was recorded in cost of sales of which million related to the lack of demand for the probe one product and the discontinuance of the j product after a last time buy offer to teradyne s customers 
additionally  due to consolidating and downsizing of manufacturing locations  approximately million of incremental accelerated depreciation was classified in cost of sales 
during  teradyne recorded a provision of million for excess and obsolete inventory including discontinued product lines 
the total inventory provision for excess and obsolete inventory  excluding the discontinued product lines  was million in and was principally due to the sharp decline in incoming semiconductor test systems and connection systems orders 
during the third quarter of  teradyne recorded a charge of million related to an inventory writedown for the discontinuance of its flash memory product 
engineering and development engineering and development expenses  as a percentage of sales  increased to in from in  with spending increasing by million 
the increase in spending was primarily due to the additional expense base resulting from teradyne s purchase of genrad in the fourth quarter of which increased spending by approximately million and to a lesser extent the granting of the prior year s previously frozen salary increases during the third quarter of which increased spending by approximately million 
the additional engineering and development expense was partially offset by reductions in discretionary spending across all of teradyne s engineering groups which decreased spending by approximately million 
as described in the gross margin section above  teradyne recorded a charge for incremental accelerated depreciation of million which is classified in engineering and development 
selling and administrative selling and administrative expenses increased to of sales in from of sales in  with spending increasing by million

sfas provides that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances including a significant adverse change in the business outlook 
during the third quarter of  as a result of significant change in the business outlook  teradyne tested the goodwill related to the circuit board test and inspection systems segment for impairment as of september  teradyne concluded that the carrying value of the assets and liabilities associated with the circuit board test and inspection systems segment exceeded its fair value 
in the third quarter of  teradyne recognized a million goodwill impairment charge 
the impairment charge was measured by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill associated with the circuit board test and inspection systems segment to its carrying value 
the fair value of the segment was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
during the year ended december   teradyne s management concluded  in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  that certain long lived assets held for sale were impaired as the estimated fair value was less than the carrying value of these assets  and recorded charges of million 
the charge for the connection systems segment included million relating to a held for sale printed circuit board facility in san diego  california  million relating to a held for sale facility in nashua  new hampshire  and million primarily related to manufacturing equipment which was taken out of service during and is held for sale

the charge of million includes million at circuit board test and inspection systems  million at connection systems and million at semiconductor test systems 
the lease accruals are expected to be paid out over the lease terms  the latest of which expires in during the fourth quarter of  teradyne recorded charges for vacated office space under operating leases at circuit board test and inspection systems of million 
the accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities is reflected in other accrued liabilities and long term other accrued liabilities 
teradyne recorded a charge for severance and related benefits during of million 
there were approximately  employees terminated across all functional groups during all remaining severance benefits payable to these employees will be paid by the end of the first quarter of teradyne recorded a charge for severance and related benefits during of million 
there were approximately  employees terminated across all functional groups during as of december   teradyne has paid all severance benefits relating to the terminations 
the accrual for severance and benefits is reflected in accrued employees compensation and withholdings 
the restructuring actions taken during are expected to generate cost savings of approximately million annually across all areas of operations 
in connection with its restructuring plan for genrad in  teradyne recorded million of additional goodwill relating to the finalization of its involuntary termination plan and recorded million of additional goodwill relating to the completion of facility exit plans for genrad operating locations 
the table below summarizes activity relating to genrad employee termination and facility closure costs in thousands severance facility and benefits related total balance at december    employee termination costs 
  leased facility costs   cash payments   balance at december    during the first quarter of  teradyne had a reduction in workforce of approximately people 
the estimated severance charge from this reduction in personnel totals approximately million 
interest income and expense interest income decreased by million to million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decreases in interest income were attributable to lower interest rates 
interest expense increased by million to million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to interest expense related to convertible notes which teradyne issued in the fourth quarter of other income and expense  net other income and expense  net for the year ended december  and includes the following gain loss in thousands repayment of loan by divested entity  other than temporary impairment of common stock investment  writedown of investment in an engineering service provider   fair value adjustment on warrants   sale of connection systems aerospace and defense business

teradyne s proportionate share of a loss related to an equity investment in empirix  inc the carrying value of this equity investment was zero at december  and loss income before taxes loss income before income taxes was a loss of million in compared to a loss of million in semiconductor test systems  connection systems  and circuit board test and inspection systems loss before income taxes increased million  million  and million  respectively in due to decreased sales in semiconductor test systems and connection systems  goodwill and intangible asset impairments in circuit board test and inspection systems and the market conditions described above 
other test systems income before income taxes increased million due to the addition of diagnostics solutions in the fourth quarter of as part of the genrad acquisition 
income taxes for the year ended december   teradyne recorded a tax provision of million resulting in a tax rate of 
the tax rate of is primarily due to the recording of a provision for income taxes to establish a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
as a result of its review undertaken at december   teradyne concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would not be realized 
until an appropriate level of profitability is reached  teradyne will not record tax benefits on operating losses in future results of operations 
the effective tax rate benefit for the year ended was 
teradyne s effective tax rate for the year ended primarily reflects the us statutory income tax rate  the net effect of state taxes and the effect of tax benefits from its ireland manufacturing operations 
tax exemptions relating to ireland operations are effective through compared to bookings net orders decreased to million in from  million in net orders decreased in all operating segments and were led by a decrease in semiconductor test systems net orders 
connection systems net orders  circuit board test and inspection systems net orders  and other test systems net orders decreased   and  respectively 
teradyne experienced cancellations of million during teradyne s net orders for its four principal operating segments for and were as follows in millions semiconductor test systems  connection systems  circuit board test and inspection systems other test systems teradyne s backlog decreased to million in from  million in at december  and  teradyne s backlog of unfilled orders for its four principal operating segments was as follows in millions semiconductor test systems connection systems circuit board test and inspection systems other test systems customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice  subject to possible cancellation penalties 
due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders  teradyne s backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period 
delays in delivery schedules and or cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on teradyne s business and results of operations 
revenue product sales decreased in to  million from  million in service revenue declined slightly in to million from million in as the overall business declined 
semiconductor test systems sales decreased  to million in from  million in  connection systems sales decreased  to million in from million in  and circuit board test and inspection systems sales decreased  to million in from million in these decreases reflect the overall economic and industry market conditions described below 
circuit board test and inspection systems sales include the two month impact of the genrad acquisition which contributed sales of million 
other test systems sales decreased  to million in from million in  which principally reflects the divestiture of software test systems at the end of as well as the overall economic and industry market conditions described below

teradyne no longer retains title until customer payment 
teradyne s business has been adversely impacted by the slowdown in economies worldwide including the effects of the hostilities begun in september teradyne has also been adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the electronics and semiconductor industries  which experience recurring periods of oversupply of products and equipment of the type teradyne sells 
these factors have resulted in a downturn in the demand for teradyne s products 
during  orders declined significantly across all of teradyne s product lines when compared with the orders teradyne received during in and  no single customer accounted for more than of consolidated net sales 
in  teradyne s three largest customers accounted for of consolidated net sales 
gross margin gross margin  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to in from in the percentage decrease in was attributable to the decreased utilization of teradyne s manufacturing capacity  as sales volume decreased while certain components of costs of sales remained fixed and additional inventory provisions 
the decrease in the percentage of gross margin was also impacted to a lesser extent by increased competitive price pressure as current semiconductor products mature and the mix of teradyne s business changes as connection systems and circuit board test and inspection system sales  which have lower gross margins  become a larger percentage of teradyne s business 
inventory provision for excess and obsolete inventory was million in  which excludes the inventory writedowns for product line discontinuance  compared to million in  included in cost of sales 
the increase in the inventory provision was caused by the worldwide economic slowdown during between and  orders declined by approximately  million  a decrease 
this drop in orders combined with lead time requirements for inventory procurement and teradyne s new product introduction plans necessitated additional charges for excess and obsolete inventory 
during  teradyne recorded an inventory writedown in semiconductor test systems due to the discontinuance of the flash product line of million 
engineering and development engineering and development expenses  as a percentage of sales  increased to in from in  with spending decreasing by million 
this spending decrease was primarily due to lower prototype material costs and the impact of workforce reductions  salary cuts  and furloughs in semiconductor test systems and circuit board test and inspection systems  excluding the impact of the genrad acquisition 
connection systems engineering and development spending increased from to selling and administrative selling and administrative expenses increased to of sales in from of sales in  with spending decreasing by million 
the decrease in spending was principally due to certain cost containment programs such as workforce reductions  salary cuts  and furloughs 
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges include a workforce reduction and early retirement provision of million  a charge of million for certain impaired manufacturing assets at connection systems  a charge for a connection systems impaired facility of million  a charge for impaired assets of million relating to the discontinuance of the flash product line in semiconductor test systems  and a charge for vacated space under certain operating leases of million in circuit board test and inspection systems

teradyne used cash for the acquisition of treasury stock of million in since  teradyne has used million of cash to repurchase million shares of its common stock on the open market though no cash was used in and to repurchase shares of common stock 
on october   teradyne issued million principal amount of convertible senior notes due the notes in a private placement and received net proceeds of million 
the notes are convertible at the option of the holders at a rate which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share  which is equal to a conversion rate of approximately shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes 
the notes are redeemable by teradyne at any time after october  at specified prices 
teradyne began making annual interest payments of million  paid semi annually  on the notes commencing on april  the notes are senior unsecured obligations of teradyne that rank equally with teradyne s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
in the event of a change in control by which teradyne merges with or sells substantially all of its assets to a third party  the holders of the notes may be able to require teradyne to redeem some or all of the notes either in discounted teradyne common stock or in cash 
on february   the securities and exchange commission declared effective a registration statement on form s covering both the notes and the shares of common stock into which they can be converted 
on december   teradyne obtained a loan of approximately million in the form of a mortgage loan maturing on january   the mortgage 
principal payments are made according to a twenty year amortization schedule through december  with the remaining principal due on january  teradyne began making monthly principal and interest payments of million on february  on october   teradyne completed its acquisition of genrad  inc of westford  ma  a leading manufacturer of electronic automatic test equipment  related software and diagnostic solutions 
genrad s business has been made part of the circuit board test and inspection systems operating segment excluding the diagnostic solutions business 
diagnostic solutions has been made part of the other test systems operating segment 
under the terms of the acquisition  each outstanding share of genrad common stock was converted into shares of teradyne common stock 
the total number of teradyne shares exchanged for the shares of genrad  based on the shares of genrad outstanding as of the closing  was approximately million 
the following table reflects teradyne s current contractual obligations non cancelable convertible mortgage lease interest senior notes notes other commitments on debt notes payable payable debt total in thousands beyond     total        includes interest on convertible notes 
teradyne believes its cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities balance of million will be sufficient to meet working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twenty four months 
depending on market conditions and funding requirements  teradyne may seek additional external financing 
inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings 
employee stock options teradyne s equity compensation program is a broad based  long term retention program that is intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests 
teradyne considers its equity compensation program critical to teradyne s operation and productivity

certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by teradyne  statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission including this form k contain statements that are not purely historical  but are forward looking statements  made under section e of the securities exchange act of  which involve risks and uncertainties 
in particular  forward looking statements made herein include projections  plans  and objectives for teradyne s business  financial condition  operating results  future operations  or future economic performance  statements relating to the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital requirements  capital expenditures  expectations as to customer orders and demand for teradyne s products and statements relating to backlog  bookings and cancellations  gross margins and pricing considerations 
these statements are neither promises nor guarantees but involve risks and uncertainties  both known and unknown  which could cause teradyne s actual future results to differ materially from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
these factors  and others  are discussed from time to time in teradyne s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
teradyne s business is impacted by the slowdown in economies worldwide 
teradyne s business has been negatively impacted by the slowdown in the global economies that began in the second half of the uncertainty regarding the growth rate of the worldwide economies have caused companies to reduce capital investments and may cause further reduction of such investments 
these reductions have been particularly severe in the electronics and semiconductor industry which teradyne serves and have contributed to teradyne incurring losses 
teradyne cannot predict if or when the growth rate of worldwide economies will rebound  whether the growth rate of its business will rebound when the worldwide economies begin to grow  or if or when teradyne will return to profitability 
the effects of the economic decline are being felt across all of teradyne s business segments and continue to result in significantly reduced customer orders 
current geopolitical turmoil and the continuing threat of domestic and international terrorist attacks may adversely impact teradyne s revenues 
international turmoil  exacerbated by the war in iraq and the escalating tensions in north korea have contributed to an uncertain political and economic climate  both in the united states and globally  which may affect teradyne s ability to generate revenue on a predictable basis 
in addition  recent terrorist attacks internationally and the threat of future terrorist attacks both domestically and internationally have negatively impacted an already weakened worldwide economy 
as teradyne sells products both in the united states and internationally  the threat of future terrorist attacks may adversely affect teradyne s business 
these conditions make it difficult for teradyne  and it customers  to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could have a material adverse effect on teradyne s business  financial condition and results of operations 
teradyne s business is dependent on the current and anticipated market for electronics 
teradyne s business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics  which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products 
the current and anticipated market demand for electronics has been impacted by the economic slowdown that began in the latter portions of and the effects of the hostilities begun in september historically  the electronics and semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of over supply  which often have had a severe negative effect on demand for test equipment  including systems manufactured and marketed by teradyne 
teradyne believes that the markets for newer generations of electronic products such as those that teradyne manufactures and markets will also be subject to similar fluctuations 
teradyne is dependent on the timing of customer orders and the deferral or cancellation of previous customer orders could have an adverse effect on its results of operations 
teradyne cannot assure that the continued slump in new orders will turn around in the future or that any increase in sales or new orders for a calendar year will be sustained in subsequent years 
in addition  any factor adversely affecting the electronics industry or particular segments within the electronics industry may adversely affect teradyne s business  financial condition and operating results 
teradyne has taken and expects to continue to take measures to address the current slowdown in the market for its products which could have long term negative effects on teradyne s business 
teradyne has taken and expects to continue to take measures to address the current slowdown in the market for its products 
in particular  teradyne has reduced its workforce  closed facilities  reduced the pay of certain employees  implemented furloughs  discontinued certain of its product lines  implemented material cost reduction programs  reduced its planned capital expenditures and expense budgets 
these measures have reduced expenses in the face of decreased revenues due to decreased or cancelled customer orders 
however  each measure teradyne has taken and any additional measures taken in the future to contain expenditures could have long term negative effects on teradyne s business by reducing its pool of technical talent  decreasing or slowing improvements in its products  increasing teradyne s debt  and making it more difficult for teradyne to respond to customers or competitors 
teradyne s business may be adversely impacted by acquisitions which may affect its ability to manage and maintain its business 
since teradyne s inception  it has acquired a number of businesses 
in the future  teradyne may undertake additional acquisitions of businesses that complement its existing operations 
such past or future acquisitions could involve a number of risks  including 
the diversion of the attention of management and other key personnel  
the inability to effectively integrate an acquired business into teradyne s culture  product and service delivery methodology and other standards  controls  procedures and policies  
the inability to retain the management  key personnel and other employees of an acquired business  
the inability to retain the customers of an acquired business  
the possibility that teradyne s reputation will be adversely affected by customer satisfaction problems of an acquired business  
potential known or unknown liabilities associated with an acquired business  including but not limited to regulatory  environmental and tax liabilities  
the amortization of acquired identifiable intangibles  which may adversely affect teradyne s reported results of operations  and 
litigation which has or which may arise in the future in connection with such acquisitions 
for example  in connection with the august acquisition of each of herco technology corp  a california company  and perception laminates  inc  a california company  a complaint was filed on or about september  and is now pending in federal district court  san diego  california  by the former owners of those companies naming as defendants teradyne and two of its executive officers 
this case is further described in item legal proceedings in this form k 
additionally  in  teradyne was designated as a potentially responsible party prp at a clean up site in los angeles  california 
this claim arises out of teradyne s acquisition of perception laminates  inc in august prior to that date  perception laminates had itself acquired certain assets of alco industries inc under an asset purchase agreement dated july  neither teradyne nor perception laminates have ever conducted any operations at the los angeles site 
teradyne has asked the state of california to drop the prp designation  but california has not yet agreed to do so 
this case is further described in item business under environmental affairs in this form k 
in addition to the foregoing  any acquired business could significantly underperform relative to teradyne s expectations 
teradyne currently faces  and in the future may be the subject of  securities class action litigation due to past or future stock price volatility 
teradyne and two of its executive officers were named as defendants in three purported class action complaints that were filed in federal district court  boston  massachusetts  in october and november the court consolidated the cases and has appointed three lead plaintiffs 
on november   plaintiffs filed and served a consolidated amended class action complaint 
the complaint alleges  among other things  that the defendants violated sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  by making  during the period from july  until october   material misrepresentations and omissions to the investing public regarding teradyne s business operations and future prospects 
the complaint seeks unspecified damages  including compensatory damages and recovery of reasonable attorneys fees and costs 
teradyne filed a motion to dismiss all claims asserted in the complaint on february  teradyne s motion has not yet been heard 
claims asserted in this case are similar to the claims asserted in the case discussed in item legal proceedings  which is pending in the federal district court in san diego  california 
teradyne believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims and will defend itself vigorously 
management does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect on teradyne s financial position or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any such claims would not have a material adverse effect on teradyne s financial position or results of operations 
teradyne s business may be adversely impacted by divestitures of lines of business which may affect its ability to manage and maintain its business 
since teradyne s inception  it has divested itself of certain lines of business 
in the future  teradyne may undertake additional such divestitures 
such past or future divestitures could involve a number of risks  including 
the diversion of the attention of management and other key personnel  
disruptions and other effects caused by the divestiture of a line of business on teradyne s culture  product and service delivery methodology and other standards  controls  procedures and policies  
customer satisfaction problems caused by the loss of a divested line of business  and 
the decreased diversification of teradyne s product lines caused by the divestiture of a line of business which may make teradyne s operating results subject to increased market fluctuations 
if teradyne is unable to protect its intellectual property  teradyne may lose a valuable asset or may incur costly litigation to protect its rights 
teradyne s products incorporate technology that it protects in several ways  including patents  copyrights and trade secrets 
while teradyne believes that its patents  copyrights and trade secrets have value in general  no single one is in itself essential 
at times  teradyne has been notified that it may be in violation of patents held by others 
an assertion of patent infringement against teradyne  if successful  could have a material adverse effect on its ability to sell its products  or could require a lengthy and expensive defense which could adversely affect its operating results 
if teradyne fails to develop new technologies to adapt to its customers needs and if its customers fail to accept its new products  teradyne s revenues will be adversely affected 
teradyne believes that its technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of its engineers 
teradyne s development of new technologies  commercialization of those technologies into products  and market acceptance and customer demand for those products is critical to teradyne s success 
successful product development and introduction depends upon a number of factors  including 
new product selection  
development of competitive products by competitors  
timely and efficient completion of product design  
timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing  and 
assembly processes and product performance at customer locations 
teradyne is subject to intense competition 
teradyne faces significant competition throughout the world in each of its operating segments 
some of teradyne s competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products 
teradyne also faces competition from internal suppliers at several of its customers 
some of teradyne s competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those teradyne currently offers 
teradyne expects its competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics 
new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of teradyne s products 
moreover  increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition  which could materially adversely affect teradyne s business  financial condition and results of operations 
teradyne is subject to risks of operating internationally 
teradyne derives a significant portion of its total revenue from customers outside the united states 
teradyne s international sales are subject to significant risks and difficulties  including 
unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and in policy changes affecting international markets  
compliance with customs regulations  
changes in tariffs and exchange rates  
political and economic instability  acts of terrorism and international conflicts  
difficulties in accounts receivable collection  
difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  and 
potentially adverse tax consequences  such as the world trade organization s dispute against the us foreign sales credit 
teradyne s business may suffer if it is unable to attract and retain key employees 
competition for certain employees with skills required by teradyne is intense in the high technology industry 
teradyne s success will depend on its ability to attract and retain key technical employees in this business segment 
the loss of one or more key or other employees  teradyne s inability to attract additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on teradyne s business  results of operations or financial condition 
if teradyne s suppliers do not meet teradyne s product or delivery requirements  teradyne could have reduced revenues and earnings 
the availability of certain components  including semiconductor chips  may be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet teradyne s quality or delivery requirements 
if any of teradyne s suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments with teradyne or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for teradyne s products  teradyne could lose time sensitive customer orders and have significantly decreased quarterly revenues and earnings  which would have a material adverse effect on teradyne s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  teradyne relies upon third party contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in its products  and teradyne s ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors  over whom teradyne does not exercise any control 
teradyne may incur significant liabilities if it fails to comply with environmental regulations 
teradyne is subject to environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use  storage  discharge  site cleanup  and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing processes 
if teradyne fails to comply with present and future regulations  or is required to perform site remediation  teradyne could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production 
present and future regulations may also 
restrict teradyne s ability to expand its facilities  
require teradyne to acquire costly equipment  or 
require teradyne to incur other significant costs and expenses 
teradyne has substantially increased its indebtedness 
on october   teradyne completed a private placement of million principal amount of convertible senior notes the notes due and received net proceeds of million 
on december   teradyne obtained a loan of approximately million in the form of a mortgage loan maturing on january  the mortgage 
as a result  teradyne has incurred approximately million principal amount of additional indebtedness  substantially increasing its ratio of debt to total capitalization 
the level of teradyne s indebtedness  among other things  could 
make it difficult for teradyne to make payments on its debt and other obligations  
make it difficult for teradyne to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  
require the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to service for indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes  including capital expenditures  
limit teradyne s flexibility in planning for  or reacting to changes in  its business and the industries in which teradyne competes  
place teradyne at a possible competitive disadvantage with respect to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources  and 
make teradyne more vulnerable in the event of a further downturn in its business 
there can be no assurance that teradyne will be able to meet its debt service obligations  including its obligations under the notes and the mortgage 
teradyne may not be able to satisfy certain obligations in the event of a change in control 
the indenture governing the notes contains provisions that apply to a change in control of teradyne 
if a change in control as defined in the indenture is triggered  teradyne may be required to offer to purchase the notes with cash 
if teradyne has to make that offer  teradyne cannot be sure that it will have enough funds to pay for all the notes that the holders could tender 
in the event of a change in control of teradyne  the mortgage lender may elect to declare all amounts due under the mortgage to be immediately due and payable  and may elect to take possession of or sell the property subject to the mortgage 
teradyne may not be able to pay its debt and other obligations 
if teradyne s cash flow is inadequate to meet its obligations  teradyne could face substantial liquidity problems 
if teradyne sustains continued losses or is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the notes  the mortgage  or certain of its other obligations  teradyne would be in default under the terms thereof  which would permit the holders of those obligations to accelerate their maturity and also could cause defaults under future indebtedness teradyne may incur 
any such default could have a material adverse effect on teradyne s business  prospects  financial position and operating results 
in addition  teradyne cannot assure that it would be able to repay amounts due in respect of the notes or the mortgage if payment of those obligations were to be accelerated following the occurrence of any other event of default as defined in the instruments creating those obligations 
moreover  teradyne cannot assure that it will have sufficient funds or will be able to arrange for financing to pay the principal amount due on the notes or the mortgage at their respective maturities 
teradyne may need additional financing  which could be difficult to obtain 
teradyne expects that its existing cash and marketable securities  cash generated from operations  the proceeds of the notes offering in october and the proceeds from the mortgage financing in december  will be sufficient to meet teradyne s cash requirements to fund operations and expected capital expenditures for the next twenty four months 
however  teradyne has a finite amount of cash and in the event teradyne may need to raise additional funds  due to on going losses or other reasons  teradyne cannot be certain that it will be able to obtain such additional financing on favorable terms  if at all  particularly in light of teradyne s continued quarterly losses 
further  if teradyne issues additional equity securities  stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock 
future financings may place restrictions on how teradyne operates its business 
if teradyne cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  if and when needed  teradyne may not be able to develop or enhance its products and services  take advantage of future opportunities  grow its business or respond to competitive pressures  which could seriously harm teradyne s business 
if teradyne is required to account for options under its employee stock plans as a compensation expense  teradyne s compensation expense would be increased 
there has been an increasing public debate about the proper accounting treatment for employee stock options 
teradyne currently discloses pro forma compensation expense quarterly by calculating the grants fair value and disclosing the impact on net loss earnings and net loss earnings per share in a footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
it is possible that future laws and regulations will require teradyne to record the fair value of all stock options as compensation expense in its consolidated statement of operations 
note b  accounting policies  of the consolidated financial statements reflects the impact that such a change in accounting treatment would have had on teradyne s net loss income and loss earnings per share if it had been in effect during the past three years 
also included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  teradyne has included stock based compensation disclosures that exceed current disclosure requirements 
provisions of teradyne s charter and by laws and massachusetts law make a takeover of teradyne more difficult 
teradyne s basic corporate documents  its stockholder rights plan  and massachusetts law contain provisions that could discourage  delay or prevent a change in the control of teradyne  even if a change of control might be regarded as beneficial to some or all of teradyne s stockholders 
teradyne s operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly 
teradyne s quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability  including 
competitive pressures on selling prices  
the timing of customer orders and the deferral or cancellation of orders previously received  
provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  
charges for certain long lived assets  including goodwill  
changes in product mix  
teradyne s ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  
the introduction of products and technologies by teradyne s competitors  
market acceptance of teradyne s and its competitors products  
fulfilling backlog on a timely basis  
reliance on sole source suppliers  
potential retrofit costs  
the level of orders received which can be shipped in a quarter  and 
the timing of investments in engineering and development 
in particular  due to teradyne s introduction of a number of new  complex test systems in and  there can be no assurance that teradyne will not experience delays in shipment of its products or that its products will achieve customer acceptance 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  teradyne has and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect its business  financial condition  operating results and stock price 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s concentration of credit risk financial instruments which potentially subject teradyne to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments  forward currency contracts  and accounts receivable 
teradyne maintains cash investments primarily in us treasury and government agency securities and corporate debt securities  rated aa or higher  which have minimal credit risk 
teradyne places forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers 
teradyne performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and does not require collateral to secure accounts receivable 
exchange rate risk management teradyne regularly enters into forward contracts in european and japanese currencies to hedge its overseas net monetary position 
forward currency contracts generally have maturities of less than one year 
these contracts are used to reduce teradyne s risk associated with exchange rate movements  as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures 
teradyne does not engage in currency speculation 
at december  and  the face amount of outstanding forward currency contracts to buy us dollars to hedge those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies was million and million  respectively 
a fluctuation in exchange rates for and currencies would change the fair value by approximately million and million  respectively 
however  since these contracts hedge non us currency assets and liabilities  any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by opposite changes in the underlying value of these assets and liabilities being hedged 
the hypothetical movement was estimated by calculating the fair value of the forward currency contracts at december  and comparing that with those calculated using hypothetical forward currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk management teradyne is exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates 
the principal interest rate exposure is to changes in domestic interest rates 
investments with interest rate risk include short and long term marketable securities 
debt with interest rate risk includes the fixed rate convertible debt and mortgages 
in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk  a fluctuation in interest rates was assumed 
since the convertible debt was out of the money at year end  it was treated as a fixed rate debt security and the analysis assumes that the entire principal amount is repaid in full at maturity and the exercise of the embedded equity option is ignored 
market risk for the short and long term marketable securities was estimated as the potential decrease in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio 
on this basis  the potential loss in fair value from changes in interest rates is million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the potential loss reflects a fair value loss on debt offset by a fair value gain on investments 
teradyne expects to hold its debt to maturity or conversion  whichever is sooner 
therefore  the realization of the potential loss on the debt obligations is unlikely
