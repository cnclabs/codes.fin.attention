capital expenditures for fiscal were  substantially all of which related to the addition of a concept to a restaurant and the image enhancement of two restaurants 
in fiscal the company made principal payments on long term debt of  and on capital lease obligations of the quick service restaurant operations of the company have historically provided sufficient cash flow to service the company s debt  refurbish and upgrade restaurant properties and cover administrative overhead

the company has obtained waivers of these violations from the applicable lenders 
as these waivers continue through the end of fiscal year  the company has classified its debt as long term as of march  all payments on the company s debt have been  and continue to be current and management believes that the company will continue to be able to service the debt 
if the company does not comply with debt covenants in the future  and if future waivers are not obtained  the lenders will have certain remedies available to them which could include calling of the debt or acceleration of payments 
noncompliance with the requirements of the company s mortgage debt  if not waived  could also trigger cross default provisions of other debt agreements

during the term of the extension  the exchange will monitor the company s performance and the company will be required to report to the exchange any change in its performance which would be inconsistent with the plan which was approved by the exchange on april any failure to meet the operating plan which was accepted by the exchange could result in the commencement of delisting proceedings 
if the company were delisted  or if its common shares were suspended from trading  the liquidity of its common shares could be diminished 
the company has been financing the expansion and image enhancement of its restaurants primarily through the use of long term debt on which the rate is fixed at the time of funding 
at march  there was  of such debt outstanding at rates ranging from to 
the company s market risk exposure is primarily due to possible fluctuations in interest rates as they relate to future borrowings 
the company has evaluated the potential effect of a increase in these rates on future capital spending plans and believes that there would be no material effect 
the company does not enter into derivative financial investments for trading or speculation purposes 
as a result  the company believes that its market risk exposure is not material to the company s financial position  liquidity or results of operations

the status of the development agreement has been discussed with the franchisor and the company has not been declared in default of the agreement
