item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we develop  manufacture and market essure  an innovative and proprietary non incisional permanent birth control device for women 
essure is a soft and flexible micro insert delivered into a woman s fallopian tubes designed to provide permanent birth control by causing a benign tissue in growth that blocks the fallopian tubes 
a successfully placed essure prohibits the egg from traveling through the fallopian tubes and therefore prevents fertilization 
the essure placement procedure is typically performed as an outpatient procedure and is intended to be a less invasive and a less costly alternative to tubal ligation  the leading form of birth control in the united states and worldwide 
in november  we obtained approval to market essure in the united states from the united states food and drug administration  or the fda  and have started our sales and marketing campaign in the united states 
internationally  essure is currently being marketed in australia  singapore  indonesia  canada and fifteen countries in europe 
we believe that essure represents an attractive  non invasive  alternative to tubal ligation for women seeking permanent birth control 
laparoscopic tubal ligation and tubal ligation by laparotomy typically involve abdominal incisions and or punctures  general or regional anesthesia  four to ten days of normal recovery time and the risks associated with an incisional procedure 
the essure placement procedure does not require cutting or penetrating the abdomen  which is expected to lower the likelihood of post operative pain due to the incisions punctures  and is typically performed in an outpatient setting without general or regional anesthesia 
in the pivotal trial of essure  the total procedure time averaged minutes  with an average of minutes of hysteroscopic time to place the essure micro insert 
a patient is typically discharged approximately minutes after the essure placement procedure 
no overnight hospital stay is required 
furthermore  essure is effective without drugs or hormones 
we believe essure will also appeal to women who have completed childbearing but who are using either temporary birth control methods or no birth control method 
among women from our phase ii clinical study and pivotal trial who have worn the micro inserts for two years or more  rated their comfort with essure as good to excellent at the follow up visits conducted as of october excluding the day of the essure placement procedure  of the patients in the pivotal trial who were employed returned to work in one day or less 
essure s safety and recovery profile is one of the reasons that we believe it may be a preferred alternative to currently available methods of permanent birth control 
we believe that physicians will be receptive to essure because it is a less invasive permanent birth control option to offer their patients 
we also believe physicians will find essure procedures relatively easy to perform after completing our training program 
we believe hospitals will be able to utilize their facilities more cost effectively with the essure placement procedure compared with tubal ligation 
we expect payors to experience cost reductions resulting from the elimination of overhead and procedural costs related to anesthesia and post operative hospital stays associated with tubal ligations 
in addition  payors may also benefit from the reduction of unplanned pregnancies associated with non permanent methods of birth control used by patients who have chosen to avoid the drawbacks of currently available permanent birth control methods but who may elect to use essure 
in november  we received formal notification from the fda that essure had been approved for marketing in the united states 
in order to obtain this approval  we commenced an international pivotal trial in 
table of contents may to obtain month safety  effectiveness and patient satisfaction data on women to support the submission of a pre market approval  or pma  application with the fda 
additionally  we have an ongoing phase ii clinical study of safety and effectiveness that we initiated in november shortly after we received fda approval in november  we made our first commercial sales of essure in the united states 
during the second half of  we increased hiring activities in our united states sales  professional education and marketing functions 
we currently have professional education field trainers and sales representatives across the united states 
our professional education effort will be entirely focused on physician training 
we will monitor the length of time required for united states physicians to adopt essure as a routine part of their gynecological practice 
we will initially target large group gynecological practices with the goal of training  inclusive of preceptorship  approximately physicians by the end of as of december   we have put more than doctors through our initial training course in the united states 
during the second quarter of  we will be setting up a united states call center to answer questions prospective patients may have regarding essure as well as to provide trained physician referral information 
essure is listed with australia s therapeutic goods administration or the tga  which allows us to market and sell essure in australia 
recently  the tga has revised their current law to require that all products listed under the tga must also be registered with the tga within the next five years and filing fees are required with the registration 
we intend to comply with this requirement 
we have a sales and marketing group in australia and began commercial sales there in the second quarter of in february  we received approval to affix the ce mark to essure  indicating that essure is certified for sale throughout the european union  subject to compliance with local regulations such as registration with health ministries and or particular requirements regarding labeling or distribution 
we currently have ongoing reimbursement studies being conducted in france and the uk we have established distribution partnerships in select european countries  including the austria  belgium  denmark  finland  germany  holland  italy  norway  portugal  spain  sweden  switzerland  turkey and the uk  and made our first sales to distributors in december we initiated a direct sales program in france during and our first commercial sale was made in october we received clearance from health canada to market essure in canada in november and made our first commercial sale through a distributor in canada in january our future revenues and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and will depend upon  among other factors  the extent to which essure gains market acceptance domestically and internationally  the rate at which we train united states physicians  the sales and training activity of our international distributors or marketing partners  the introduction of competitive products and other factors discussed in this form k 
results of operations years ended december  and net sales were million in  of which were from europe  from australia  from asia and canada and from the united states 
net sales were million in  of which were from australia  from asia and canada  from europe and none from the united states 
the increase in net sales of million is the result of increased commercialization of essure in various regions of the world  including the united states 
we expect our net sales to increase in and that net sales from the united states will become the major contributor of our global net sales as we continue to focus our sales and marketing effort in developing the united states market 
cost of sales and start up manufacturing costs increased by million to million in as compared to million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in units sold and our continued investment in manufacturing infrastructure  including staff and capacity to transition to commercial scale manufacturing 
we anticipate cost of sales to increase with the increase in net sales 

table of contents research and development expenses  which include clinical  regulatory  quality assurance and pilot manufacturing expenses  increased by million to million in as compared with million in the increase is primarily due to activities pertaining to the pma application process and our on going clinical trials 
research and development costs are expected to remain relatively consistent to that of levels as we complete our pivotal and phase ii clinical trials and continue to invest in product development to improve product design 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in as compared to million in in the united states of america  expenditures in sales and marketing increased dramatically due to united states commercialization efforts 
the increases primarily were attributable to a million increase in domestic selling  marketing and strategic reimbursement headcount and other employee related expenses  a million increase in connection with establishment of a professional education department to facilitate the training of doctors which we believe is essential to the successful commercialization of essure  and a million increase related to advertising and tradeshows 
we were present at several major medical conferences and meetings  such as aagl american association of gynecologic laparoscopists to increase awareness of essure in the medical community  and we have also retained outside public relations firms and advertising agencies to increase awareness of essure 
internationally  expenditures increased by million in connection with establishing a french sales division to develop the european market 
expenditures in australia increased moderately by million 
general and administrative expenses increased by million for expenditures incurred to support the growth of the company and for expenditures incurred in the patent litigation matter with ovion  inc selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in as we expend more resources in developing the united states market 
net interest and other income in decreased by million to million in as compared to million in the decrease is due to lower average interest rates paid on our invested funds 
we invest our excess cash in high quality  short term commercial paper  government securities and money market funds 
net loss increased or million to million in compared with million in due primarily to sales and marketing expenses related to united states commercialization and continued investment in our manufacturing operations 
we have a limited history of operation and have experienced significant losses since inception 
we expect our operating losses to continue at least into as we continue to expend substantial resources to develop the united states market and increase our manufacturing capabilities for full scale commercialization 
years ended december  and net sales in were million  of which were from australia  from asia and canada and from europe 
there were no sales in for and  we did not have sales in the united states 
cost of sales and start up manufacturing costs were million in as compared to none in our cost of sales in consisted primarily of start up manufacturing costs related to the initial commercialization of essure 
research and development expenses decreased in to million from million in the decrease in was primarily due to the completion of pivotal trial patient enrollment in early selling  general and administrative expenses increased or million to million in from million in  due primarily to addition of marketing personnel and costs associated with advertising and promotions in support of the commercial introduction of essure in australia 
the recovery of legal expense of million in represents reimbursement from the company s directors and officers liability insurance policy for legal defense costs in connection with a sexual harassment 
table of contents lawsuit filed against the company in december a jury found in favor of the company on all charges in net interest and other income in was million  which is comparable with what we earned in income taxes as a result of our net loss of million  we incurred no income tax expense in as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
in addition  at december   we had federal and state research credit carry forwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the net operating loss and credit carry forwards described above will expire at various dates beginning in the years through  if not utilized 
use of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation by the internal revenue service 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before we can use them to reduce future taxable earnings  if any 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all wholly owned subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based on historical experience and current product demand 
in addition  reserves are established to write inventory down to net realizable value 
we evaluate the adequacy of these reserves quarterly 
revenue recognition 
revenue on product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and final  delivery has occurred and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and consider delivery to have occurred at the time of shipment 
accounts receivable 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while our credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowance established  we might not continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers 
therefore  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one customer could make it more difficult for us to collect our accounts receivable and require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
management analyzes historical returns  customer payment histories  current economic 
table of contents trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of warranty and other allowances 
warranty accrual 
we offer warranties on our product and record a liability for the estimated future costs associated with warranty claims  which is based upon historical experiences and our estimate of the level of future costs 
warranty costs are reflected in the statement of operations as a cost of sales 
foreign currency translation 
assets and liabilities of non united states subsidiaries that operate where the local currency is the functional currency are translated to united states dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date with the resulting translation adjustments recorded directly to a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
income and expense accounts are translated at average exchange rates during the year 
where the united states dollar is the functional currency  translation adjustments are recorded in income 
under the relevant accounting guidance  the treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependent upon management s determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions would be considered the functional currency but any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operation must also be considered 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed above  we consider the local currency to be the functional currency for each of our international subsidiaries 
accordingly  gains and losses from foreign currency transactions  which were not material for any of the years presented  are included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
contingencies 
we account for contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  sfas no 
requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issurance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as environmental  legal and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate  if the actual loss from a loss contingency is significantly different than the estimated loss  our results of operations may be over or understated 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statement no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas no 
which eliminates inconsistencies between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
sfas no 
also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after may  and for transactions occurring after may  we do not expect adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position or on our results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities sfas no 
which addresses the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance that the eitf has set forth in eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position or on our results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin 
table of contents requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee 
in addition  fin requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued  including a reconciliation of changes in the entity s product warranty liabilities 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements for interim or annual periods ending after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position or on our results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also requires prominent disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation in both annual and interim financial statements 
the transition and annual disclosure requirements of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods beginning after december  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or on our results of operations 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on our financial position or on our results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our financial position or on our results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources we have experienced significant operating losses since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments of million compared with million at december  the increase in these balances as of december  was primarily the result of net proceeds derived from a follow on public equity offering completed in june and july  in which we sold million shares of common stock at per share 
net proceeds from the follow on public offering were million after underwriter s discount  commissions and other offering costs 
net cash used in operating activities increased to million in as compared with million in the increase in net cash used in was primarily related to net operating losses resulting from increased sales and marketing efforts related to the commercialization of essure in the united states and continued investment of our operations in australia and europe  payments related to our clinical trials  and scale up of our manufacturing and quality operations in order to transition to commercial scale production 
net cash used in 
table of contents operating activities increased to million in from million in the increase in net cash used in was primarily related to funding net operating losses  a result of increased sales and marketing efforts related to the commercialization of essure in australia and europe  payments related to our clinical trials  and scale up of our manufacturing and quality operations in order to transition to commercial scale manufacturing 
net cash used in investing activities was million in as compared with net cash provided by investing activities of million in the increase in net cash used in investing activities in consisted primarily of purchased short term investments and capital expenditures used to expand our manufacturing operations and fund leasehold improvements 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in and consisted primarily of matured short term investments partially offset by purchases of investments and capital expenditures used to expand our manufacturing operations and fund leasehold improvements for planned growth 
net cash used in investing activities in of million were primarily capital expenditures used in anticipation of planned growth in employees  facilities and corporate infrastructures 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in as compared with million in the net cash provided by financing activities in consisted primarily of the net proceeds from the follow on public offering completed in june and july  in which we sold million shares of common stock at per share 
in  we issued a total of million shares of common stock  primarily in private placement transactions in april and november of in  net cash provided by financing activities of million was from the sale and issuance of million shares of common stock in a private placement transaction in july we have operating lease obligations on our current building facilities and equipment 
estimated net lease payments due within a year and years total million and million  respectively 
we also have long term obligations related to our phase ii clinical study and pivotal trial 
estimated clinical trial liabilities due within a year and years total million and million  respectively 
additionally  we have a  standby letter of credit commitment in connection with an equipment lease 
the letter of credit is renewable every year 
we expect to have negative cash flows from operations into at least and we estimate that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements into the successful achievement of our business objectives may require additional financing and therefore  we may in the future seek to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
additional funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs or reduce our sales and marketing activities 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including  among others resources devoted to establish sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  resources devoted to increasing our manufacturing capacity  the rate of product adoption by doctors and patients  and the insurance payor community s acceptance of and reimbursement for the essure procedure 

table of contents risk factors in addition to the other information in this form k  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating conceptus and our business 
this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth below and elsewhere in this form k 
we have a limited history of operation with essure and have incurred significant operating losses since our inception 
we expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future and we may never achieve or maintain profitability 
we have a limited history of operation and have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in  including operating losses of million in  million in  and million in we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses and net losses as we begin to expand sales and marketing efforts in the united states 
our net losses may continue to increase until sufficient revenues can be generated to offset these expenses 
we may not be able to generate these revenues  and we may never achieve profitability 
our failure to achieve and sustain profitability would negatively impact the market price of our common stock 
if our product fails to gain market acceptance  our business will suffer 
we are attempting to introduce a novel product into the contraception market  which is dominated by procedures that are well established among physicians and patients and are routinely taught to new physicians 
as a result  we believe that recommendations and endorsements by physicians will be essential for market acceptance of our product 
we do not know whether physicians and patients will accept our product or whether we will be able to obtain their recommendations or endorsements 
we believe that physicians will not use a product unless they determine  based on clinical data and other factors  that it is an attractive alternative to other means of contraception and that it offers clinical utility in a cost effective manner 
physicians are traditionally slow to adopt new products and treatment practices  partly because of perceived liability risks 
if essure does not achieve significant market acceptance among physicians  patients and healthcare payors  even if reimbursement and necessary international and united states regulatory approvals are obtained  we may never achieve significant revenues or profitability 
government or third party reimbursement for essure may not be available or may be inadequate  which would limit our future product revenues and delay or prevent our profitability 
market acceptance of essure in the united states and in international markets will depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing healthcare payment systems 
reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and sometimes by region  and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country by country basis 
many international markets have government managed health care systems that determine reimbursement for new devices and procedures 
in most markets  there are private insurance systems as well as government managed systems 
regardless of the type of reimbursement system  we believe that physician advocacy of our product will be required to obtain reimbursement 
availability of reimbursement will depend  at least in part  on the clinical and cost effectiveness of our product 
we do not know whether reimbursement for our product will be available in the united states or in international markets under either government or private reimbursement systems  or whether physicians will support and advocate reimbursement for use of our systems for all indications intended by us 
large scale market acceptance of essure will depend on the availability and level of reimbursement in the united states and targeted international markets 
we may be unable to obtain or maintain reimbursement in any country within a particular time  for a particular amount  or at all  which would limit our future product revenues and delay or prevent our profitability 

table of contents if the effectiveness and safety of our product are not supported by long term data  we may not achieve market acceptance and we could be subject to liability 
the pivotal trial of essure was designed to support a pma application and to have five years of post market follow up 
in addition  patients in the phase ii study will be followed to five years 
the long term results of using essure will not be available for several years 
if long term patient studies or clinical experience indicate that essure is less effective or less safe than our current data suggest  we may not achieve market acceptance and or we could be subject to significant liability 
we may not maintain regulatory approvals for essure  our only product  which would delay or prevent us from generating product revenues  and would harm our business and force us to curtail or cease operations 
numerous government authorities  both in the united states and internationally  regulate the manufacture and sale of medical devices  including essure 
in the united states  the principal regulatory authorities are the fda and corresponding state agencies  such as the california department of health services 
the process of obtaining and maintaining required regulatory clearances is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
we have received fda approval to market essure in the united states  the loss of which or our failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could delay or prevent us from generating product revenues 
sales of medical devices outside of the united states are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
the time required to obtain clearance required by foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for fda clearance  and requirements for licensing may differ significantly from fda requirements 
many countries in which we currently market or intend to market essure either do not currently regulate medical devices or have minimal registration requirements  however  these countries may develop more extensive regulations in the future  which could delay or prevent us from marketing essure in these countries 
the fda and certain foreign regulatory authorities impose numerous requirements with which medical device manufacturers must comply in order to maintain regulatory approvals 
fda enforcement policy strictly prohibits the promotion of approved medical devices for uses other than those for which the device is specifically approved by the fda 
we will be required to adhere to applicable fda regulations  such as the quality system regulation  and similar regulations in other countries  which include testing  control and documentation requirements 
ongoing compliance with the quality system regulation and other applicable regulatory requirements will be monitored through periodic inspections by federal and state agencies  including the fda and the california department of health services  and by comparable agencies in other countries 
if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  we may be subject to  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to grant pre market clearance or pre market approval for devices  withdrawal of approvals and criminal prosecution  any of which could negatively impact our business 
our intellectual property rights may not provide meaningful commercial protection for our product  which could enable third parties to use our technology  or very similar technology  and could impair our ability to compete in the market 
we rely on patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws to limit the ability of others to compete with us using the same or similar technology in the united states and other countries 
however  as described below  these laws afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights to the extent necessary to sustain any competitive advantage we may have 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting their proprietary rights abroad 
these problems can be caused by the absence of rules and methods for defending intellectual property rights 

table of contents we will be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
the patent positions of companies developing medical devices  including our patent position  generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions concerning the enforceability of such patents against alleged infringement 
recent judicial decisions have established new case law and a reinterpretation of previous patent case law  and consequently we cannot assure you that historical legal standards surrounding the questions of infringement and validity will be applied in future cases 
in addition  legislation may be pending in congress that  if enacted in its present form  may limit the ability of medical device manufacturers in the future to obtain patents on surgical and medical procedures that are not performed by  or as a part of  devices or compositions that are themselves patentable 
our ability to protect our proprietary methods and procedures may be compromised by the enactment of this legislation or any other limitation or reduction in the patentability of medical and surgical methods and procedures 
changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the united states and other countries may therefore diminish the value of our intellectual property 
we own  or control through licenses  a variety of issued patents and pending patent applications 
however  the patents on which we rely may be challenged and invalidated  and our patent applications may not result in issued patents 
moreover  our patents and patent applications may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products 
we also face the risk that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies 
we have taken security measures to protect our proprietary information  especially proprietary information that is not covered by patents or patent applications 
these measures  however  may not provide adequate protection of our trade secrets or other proprietary information 
we seek to protect our proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees  collaborators and consultants 
nevertheless  employees  collaborators or consultants could still disclose our proprietary information and we may not be able to protect our trade secrets in a meaningful way 
if we lose any employees we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by those former employees despite the existence of a nondisclosure and confidentiality agreement and other contractual restrictions designed intended to protect our proprietary technology 
in addition  others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets 
our ability to compete effectively will depend substantially on our ability to develop and maintain proprietary aspects of our technology 
our issued patents  any future patents that may be issued as a result of our united states or foreign patent applications  or the patents under which we have license rights may not offer any degree of protection against competitive products 
any patents that may be issued or licensed to us or any of our patent applications could be challenged  invalidated or circumvented in the future 
if we cannot operate our business without infringing third party intellectual property rights  our prospects will suffer 
our success will also depend on our ability to operate without infringing or misappropriating the proprietary rights of others 
we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our product infringes the intellectual property rights of others 
there are numerous issued patents in the medical device industry and  as described in the next risk factor  the validity and breadth of medical device patents involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved 
our competitors may assert that our product and the methods we employ may be covered by united states or foreign patents held by them 
in addition  because patent applications can take many years to issue  there may be currently pending patent applications of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that our product may infringe 
there could also be existing patents of which we are unaware that our product may inadvertently infringe 
if we lose a patent infringement lawsuit  we could be prevented from selling our product unless we can obtain a license to use technology or ideas covered by that patent or are able to redesign the product to avoid infringement 
a license may not be available to us on terms acceptable to us  or at all  and we may not be able to redesign our 
table of contents product to avoid any infringement 
if we are not successful in obtaining a license or redesigning our product  we may be unable to sell our product and our business would suffer 
we are currently  and may in the future  be a party to patent litigation  which could be expensive and divert our management s attention 
the medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights  and companies in the industry have used intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
we may become a party to patent infringement claims and litigation or interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office  or pto  to determine the priority of inventions 
the defense and prosecution of these matters are both costly and time consuming 
we may need to commence proceedings against others to enforce our patents  to protect our trade secrets or know how or to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
these proceedings would result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel 
a third party  ovion  inc  has brought to our attention two patents and certain claims from a pending patent application owned by it 
ovion has indicated it believes that the claims of its patent and application cover essure and its use 
because we believe that some or all of ovion s claims should be included within our own patents  we have requested that the pto to declare at least one interference 
an interference is a proceeding within the pto to determine which party was the first to invent  and which party is thereby entitled to ownership of  the claims 
we believe that we filed our patent applications for our product before ovion filed the application that issued as its patent  and that we are entitled to any patentable claims now appearing in ovion s patent that cover essure 
we do not know whether the pto will declare an interference  whether we invented our product prior to ovion s date of invention  or whether we will prevail in an interference proceeding if it is declared by the pto 
if the pto refuses to declare an interference  or if ovion s claims are upheld in the interference proceeding  ovion may be able to assert its patent successfully against us 
we filed a lawsuit in united states district court for the northern district of california on april  against ovion 
the lawsuit seeks a declaration that essure does not infringe ovion s united states patent no 
 and that the patent is invalid and unenforceable due to ovion s inequitable conduct before the pto 
we subsequently amended our lawsuit to include charges of false advertising  trade libel  unfair competition  unjust enrichment and constructive trust against ovion and its principals jeffrey callister and william s 
tremulis 
during an october  hearing before the court  ovion stated that it does not intend to charge us with infringement of united states patent  however  on august   ovion has filed a separate action  in the same court  charging us with infringement of a related patent  united states patent no 
 entitled occluding device and method of use 
we have denied infringement and filed a declaratory judgment counterclaim  seeking a declaration that united states patent no 
 is not infringed  invalid and unenforceable due to ovion s inequitable conduct before the pto 
while we believe that we will prevail in the above litigations  if we do not  ovion may be able to obtain damages against us and or obtain an injunction against the essure device 
if ovion were successful  there is no guarantee that we could negotiate a suitable arrangement with it to acquire rights under its patents 
an adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings to which we are or may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties 
although patent and intellectual property disputes in the medical device area have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
we may be unable to obtain necessary licenses on satisfactory terms  if at all 
adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling essure 
one of the patents included in our license from target therapeutics  a division of boston scientific corporation  has been the subject of reexamination proceedings in the pto and an infringement lawsuit by 
table of contents target therapeutics 
the patent is directed to variable stiffness catheters for use with guidewires  as might be used in our future products 
although the pto reaffirmed the patent with amended claims and the lawsuit was settled  the patent could be challenged or invalidated in the future 
if this patent is invalidated  our ability to prevent others from using this proprietary technology would be compromised 
we have limited sales and marketing experience and minimal distribution capabilities  and if we are unable to develop our sales and marketing capabilities or enter into appropriate distribution agreements  we may be unsuccessful in commercializing essure 
in order to market  sell and distribute essure  we will need to continue to develop a sales force and marketing group with relevant experience and enter into additional arrangements with third parties to distribute essure 
developing a marketing and sales force is expensive and time consuming and can impact the affectivity of our product launch 
if we fail to establish adequate marketing and sales competencies or enter into successful distribution arrangements with third parties  we may be unable to commercialize essure successfully 
if we fail to manage our expansion  our business could be impaired 
our number of employees has increased to on february  from on february  the growth that we have experienced  and in the future may experience  provides challenges to our organization 
although we have no current plans to do so  we may in the future acquire one or more technologies  products or companies that complement our business 
we may not be able to effectively integrate these into our business 
if we fail to manage our growth and expansion  our business could be impaired 
we have limited experience in manufacturing essure in commercial quantities 
if we are successful in marketing essure  we plan to transition internal manufacturing operations to the use of third party manufacturers to manufacture certain processes and assemblies of the product 
we have identified various candidates that we believe could adequately produce essure with the appropriate quality level and in sufficient volumes 
however  third party manufacturers often encounter difficulties in scaling up production of new products  including problems involving production yields  quality control and assurance  component supply and shortages of qualified personnel  and compliance with fda or other health authority requirements 
we and or our future third party manufacturers may encounter manufacturing difficulties  which could negatively impact or delay commercialization of essure 
we depend upon sole source suppliers and have no contractual arrangements 
we purchase both raw materials used in our product and finished goods from various suppliers  and we rely on single sources for some items  including the delivery catheter tubing and polyester fiber 
we do not have formal supply contracts with several key vendors and  accordingly  these firms may not continue to supply us with raw materials or finished goods in sufficient quantities  or at all 
delays associated with any future raw materials or finished goods shortages could delay commercialization of essure  particularly as we scale up our manufacturing activities in support of united states and international commercial sales of essure 
health care reform may limit our return on our product 
the levels of revenue and profitability of medical device companies may be affected by the efforts of government and third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means 
in the united states  there have been  and we expect that there will continue to be  a number of federal  state and private proposals to control health care costs 
these proposals may contain measures intended to control public and private spending on health care as well as to provide universal public access to the health care system 
if enacted  these proposals may result in a substantial restructuring of the health care delivery system 
significant changes in the united states health care system are likely to have a substantial impact over time on the manner in which we 
table of contents conduct our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be exposed to product liability claims  and we have only limited insurance coverage 
the manufacture and sale of medical products involve an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims and product recalls 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  we cannot assure you that we will be able to avoid significant product liability claims and potential related adverse publicity 
we currently maintain product liability insurance with coverage limits of million per occurrence and an annual aggregate maximum of million  which we believe is comparable to that maintained by other companies of similar size serving similar markets 
however  we cannot assure you that product liability claims in connection with clinical trials or sales of essure will not exceed such insurance coverage limits or that such insurance will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
insurance is expensive and in the future may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage  or a recall of our product  could cause our stock price to fall 
we may not be able to attract and retain additional key management  sales and marketing and technical personnel or we may lose existing key management  sales and marketing or technical personnel  which may delay our development and marketing efforts 
we depend on a number of key management  sales and marketing and technical personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more key employees could delay the achievement of our development and marketing objectives 
our success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified management  sales and marketing and technical personnel to meet our growth goals 
we face intense competition for qualified personnel  many of whom are often subject to competing employment offers  and we do not know whether we will be able to attract and retain such personnel 
we may not be able to attract and retain a new chief executive officer or we may lose existing key management  sales and marketing or technical personnel  which may delay our development and marketing efforts 
in november  we announced that as part of our ceo succession plan  a search would commence for a new chief executive officer with significant commercialization experience 
we are in the process of interviewing candidates  however  there can be no assurance that we will identify and hire a suitable candidate in any particular time frame and delays in hiring may cause market uncertainty 
we also announced that upon our hiring of a new ceo  steven bacich  our current ceo  would become chief technical officer  however  there can be no assurance that mr 
bacich will continue with us in such role 
we generally depend on a number of key management  sales and marketing and technical personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more key employees could delay the achievement of our development and marketing objectives 
our success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified management  sales and marketing and technical personnel to meet our growth goals 
we face intense competition for qualified personnel  many of whom are often subject to competing employment offers  and we do not know whether we will be able to attract and retain such personnel 
we face intense competition  and if we are unable to compete effectively  demand for essure may be reduced 
the medical device industry is highly competitive and is characterized by rapid and significant technological change 
the length of time required for product development and regulatory approval plays an important role in a company s competitive position 
as we commercialize essure  we expect to compete with other methods of permanent contraception  in particular tubal ligation  other methods of non permanent contraception  including devices such as intrauterine devices  or iuds  vaginal rings  condoms and prescription drugs such as the birth control pill  injectable and implantable contraceptives and patches  and 
table of contents other companies that may develop permanent contraception devices that are similar to or otherwise compete with essure 
we are aware of companies that are in the early stages of development of non incisional permanent contraception devices  and other companies may develop products that could compete with essure 
competitive factors may render essure obsolete or noncompetitive or reduce demand for essure 
if we experience difficulties in our sales and operations  our financial condition will be harmed 
our financial condition is highly dependent on the sale of essure in united states  australia  europe and other countries 
if we experience difficulties in our domestic and international sales and operations  our business will suffer and our financial condition will be harmed 
our domestic and or international operations and sales are subject to a number of risks  including difficulties in accounts receivable collection  recessions in economies  changes in regulatory requirements  potentially adverse tax consequences  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in united states and other countries  and political and economic instability 
our future liquidity and capital requirements are uncertain 
as we commercialize essure on a wide scale basis  we may require additional financing and therefore may in the future seek to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
additional funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs or reduce our selling and marketing activities 
we expect to have negative cash flows from operations into at least our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including  among others the rate of product adoption by doctors and patients  obtaining government and third party reimbursement for essure  the resources devoted to increasing manufacturing capacity to meet commercial demands  our ability to reduce our cost of sales  the resources devoted to establish sales and marketing and distribution capabilities  and the progress and cost of product development programs 
our future quarterly results may fluctuate 
our future revenues and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and will depend upon  among other factors the rate at which new physicians are trained  the rate of product adoption by doctors and patients  actions relating to reimbursement matters  
table of contents the rate at which we establish united states and international distributors or marketing partners  the extent to which essure gains market acceptance  the timing and size of distributor purchases  and introduction of competitive products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
interest rate risk we have been exposed to interest rate risk as it applies to interest earned on holdings of short term marketable securities 
interest rates that may affect these items in the future will depend on market conditions and may differ from the rates we have experienced in the past 
a change in interest rates would not be material to our results of operations 
we reduce the sensitivity of our results of operations to these risks by maintaining an investment portfolio  which is primarily comprised of highly rated  short term investments 
we do not hold or issue derivative  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk our expenses  except for those related to europe and australia  were denominated in us dollars 
our revenues  and of which were in foreign currencies in and  respectively  were immaterial in relation to our overall financial position 
as a result  we have relatively little exposure to currency exchange risks and foreign exchange losses have been minimal to date 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposure denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in the future  if we feel our foreign currency exposure has increased  we may consider entering into hedging transactions to help mitigate that risk 
as of december   a fluctuation in exchange rates of in the foreign currencies to which we are exposed would not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition
