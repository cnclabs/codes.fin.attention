during the year  the company adjusted selling prices in some foreign locations to soften the impact of higher raw material costs caused by the increase in oil prices 
the company adjusted selling prices in the united states and canada effective january  the company may continue to adjust prices if raw material costs rise further 
the ability of the company to raise prices does not eliminate its exposure to pricing risks on its fleet contract business due to the terms of the agreements 
replacement of fixed assets requires a greater investment than the original asset cost due to the impact of general price level increases over the useful lives of plant and equipment 
this increased capital investment would result in higher depreciation charges affecting both inventories and cost of products sold 
capital resources and liquidity at the end of  current assets exceeded current liabilities by  cash and cash equivalents totaled  at december   decreasing by  during the year 
the company invests excess funds over various terms  but only instruments with an original maturity date of over days are classified as investments

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and commodity prices 
to mitigate such risks  the company enters into various derivative transactions 
all derivative transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined company policies and procedures  which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading purposes 
analytical techniques and selective derivative instruments are applied to manage and monitor such market exposures 
foreign currency exposure foreign currency exposures arising from cash flow transactions include firm commitments and anticipatory transactions 
translation exposure is also part of the overall foreign exchange risk 
the company s exposure to foreign currency risks exists primarily with the brazilian real  canadian dollar  mexican peso  japanese yen and european union euro 
the company regularly enters into foreign currency contracts primarily using foreign exchange forward contracts and options to manage the foreign currency risks associated with most of its firm commitment exposures 
the company also employs foreign exchange forward contracts as well as option contracts to manage the foreign currency risks associated with approximately of its anticipated future cash flow transactions within the coming twelve months 
the notional amount of these contracts at december  and were  and  respectively 
the company also limits its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by entering into offsetting asset or liability positions and by establishing and monitoring limits on unmatched positions 
the company s pre tax earnings from foreign subsidiaries and affiliates translated into us dollars using a weighted average exchange rate was  and  for the years ending december  and  respectively 
on that basis  the potential loss in the value of the company s pre tax earnings from foreign subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would have been  in and  in interest rate exposure in order to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in the general level of interest rates  the company generally maintains a large portion of its debt as fixed rate in nature by borrowing on a long term basis 
at december  and  the company had outstanding debt of  and  respectively 
at december  and  the fair value of the company s debt was  and  respectively 
in addition  at december  and  the fair value of securities held for investment was  and  respectively 
the fair value of the company s total long term debt and its securities held for investment would not be materially affected by a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates 
therefore  the effects of interest rate changes on the fair value of the company s financial instruments are limited 
securities held for investment primarily consist of obligations of states and political subdivisions  of a short term nature 
commodities exposure due to the nature of its business  the company procures almost all of its synthetic rubber  which is the predominant raw material used in manufacturing tire tread  at quarterly fixed rates using contracts with the company s main suppliers 
generally  the company adjusts its selling prices and sales allowances to reflect significant changes in commodity costs 
during the year  the company adjusted selling prices in some foreign subsidiaries to soften the impact of higher oil prices on commodity costs 
therefore  the company s exposure is limited to the extent selling price adjustments fail to offset increases in commodity costs 
the ability of the company to raise prices does not eliminate its exposure to pricing risks on its fleet contract business due to the terms of the agreements 
critical accounting policies bandag s financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the accounting policies that currently affect its financial condition and results of operations 
the company s senior management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates and related management s discussion and analysis disclosures with the audit committee of the board of directors 
accounts receivable bandag s global credit policies are corporately determined and managed through business unit credit and financial management departments to insure compliance with local laws and to effect proper credit and collections at the country level 
a significant percentage of the company s global accounts receivable are obligations of franchisees 
the majority of these accounts receivable are extended within north america 
however  bandag competes in the global marketplace and credit is extended outside of the united states 
bandag continuously monitors political  social and economic risks to insure sound credit decisions are made within these foreign markets 
bandag also extends credit in north america to customers in the trucking and transportation industry 
credit is extended to large national and regional customers on a contractual basis through bandag 
smaller regional and local trucking customers are provided credit through tds 
the total amount of credit extended to trucking and transportation customers is approximately one third of bandag s total global accounts receivable 
management evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount management reasonably believes will be collected 
general reserves for bad debts are maintained based upon the length of time the receivables are past due and upon historical write off experience by geographic location 
deferred taxes at december   the company had net deferred tax assets of  this balance consists of approximately  of net deferred tax assets primarily related to the timing of income and deductions for tax versus books  and  of net deferred tax liabilities primarily related to the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries and a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets of  deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries is provided under the assumption that all profits of the foreign subsidiaries will be repatriated to the united states and all foreign taxes paid will be available to offset united states taxes 
in addition  any deferred tax assets from a foreign jurisdiction are reviewed annually to determine the probability of realizing the asset based on a facts and circumstances approach 
if it is determined unlikely that the asset will be fully realized in the future  a valuation allowance is established against the asset

marketing programs the company currently maintains two major marketing programs distribution management request dmr program and powerplus 
both programs are designed to increase company market share by enhancing dealer capability and franchise value 
enhanced dealer capabilities and franchise values are achieved primarily through company provided financial assistance towards the acquisition of equipment  service vehicles  facility expansions and other items aligned with company goals 
under the dmr program  the company provides financial assistance in the form of dmr promissory notes from the dealer to bandag 
the proceeds from the promissory notes can only be used by the dealer toward the acquisition of equipment including equipment sold by the company  service vehicles  facility expansions and other items aligned with company goals 
the notes  with interest  have a term of up to five years 
however  if the dealer purchases a specified amount of tread rubber each year during the term of the agreement  then the company forgives either part or all of the principal and interest 
the company records a reduction in sales for the costs of the program as financial assistance is provided 
the balance of the dmr reserve at december   and was   and  respectively 
in  and  dmr costs of   and  respectively  were recorded as a reduction of sales 
the powerplus program allows a dealer to earn powerplus credits to fund certain of its equipment or other purchases 
the company establishes the qualifying purchases and the dollar amount for each pound of qualified tread rubber purchases and records dealer credits at the time of sale as a reduction of gross sales 
bandag may change or eliminate the per pound credit  or modify or discontinue the powerplus program  at any time in its sole discretion 
this fund can accumulate until the dealer has earned all or part of the payment for new bandag equipment or other approved purchases 
in   and  the company recorded   and  respectively  as a reduction of sales for the powerplus program 
outsourcing agreement in connection with a tire management outsourcing agreement entered into by tms  the company is providing tire management services to a customer 
the substance of the outsourcing agreement  as more fully described below  is that the company will provide complete maintenance of the customer s tire and wheel assets over the term of the agreement and provide a full range of services to maintain the assets 
these services include replacing and repairing tires and wheels  as well as other tire related services 
the company entered into this agreement because fleets were experiencing narrowing margins and expanding needs  including the need for suppliers such as the company to provide services  such as outsourcing services  as well as products 
the company recognizes revenue for these outsourcing services on a per mile basis based on the number of tire miles traveled by the customer s truck fleet in the month of usage 
over the term of the agreement  the company estimates that approximately of the revenue will be realized through cash payments and the balance will be realized by recording an incrementally increasing ownership percentage in the customer s tire assets 
the company agreed to accept the non cash consideration as partial payment for its services as a result of the negotiating process between the company and the customer  its longstanding relationship with the customer and the anticipated return on the contract  including the non cash consideration received 
the tire and wheel assets are classified as other assets 
in   and  these non current assets amounted to   and  respectively 
the company does not record depreciation on the tire and wheel assets  rather  the company incurs direct expenses related to the efforts of maintaining the tires at the mutually agreed upon specifications 
these amounts are expensed as incurred and approximate the amount that would otherwise be recorded as depreciation expense 
quarterly  the company evaluates the carrying value of the tire and wheel assets for impairment and adjusts the carrying value as required 
upon termination of the agreement  the tire and wheel assets will either be repurchased by the customer or a third party at a contractually agreed upon price  which the company believes will approximate their carrying value  or will remain the property of the company 
there could be a material difference between the carrying value and the realizable value should the tire and wheel assets not be repurchased by the customer  or a third party 
however  the company has determined the probability that the customer  or a third party  will not repurchase the tire and wheel assets to be highly unlikely based upon the facts and conditions surrounding the contract with this customer 
national account business the company enters into contracts to supply retreaded tires and other tire related services through its network of franchised dealers to large national and regional customers in the north american trucking and transportation industry 
these agreements are commonly referred to as national accounts both within the company and throughout the tire industry 
bandag actively pursues national account business through its fleet sales force in north america 
the national account fleet business accounted for   and  of tread rubber pounds sold in north america for   and  respectively 
the continued consolidation in the trucking and transportation industry and increasing competition from other retread suppliers has continued to place pressure on the price of finished retread tires 
these pressures on the national account business have precipitated the need for the company to provide various forms of financial assistance to its dealers to continue the supply of retreaded tires and services on these accounts 
the company internally refers to the financial assistance provided to its dealers related to national account fleet business as fleet subsidy 
in   and  fleet subsidy of   and  respectively  were recorded as a reduction of sales 
pension plans the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
a substantial portion of the company s pension amounts relate to its defined benefit plans in the united states 
the company has not made any contributions to any of the united states pension plans since plan year because the fully funded status of the plans would preclude a tax deduction 
sfas no 
and the policies used by the company generally reduce the volatility of pension income or expense arising from changes in the pension liability discount rates and the performance of the pension plan s assets 
an important element in determining the company s pension income or expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on assets 
historically the company has assumed that the long term rate of return on plan assets would be 
based on recent realized negative returns and lower projected future equity returns the company reduced the long term rate of return assumption to as of december  the company has historically had returns in excess of  however the company has experienced losses in the last three years 
nonetheless  the company believes the assumption of future returns is reasonable 
each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments 
the discount rate for december  was 
for the years ended december  and  the company recognized consolidated pre tax pension income of  and  respectively 
because of the reduction in the long term rate of return as of december   the company estimates pension expense will be approximately  for refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for further details
