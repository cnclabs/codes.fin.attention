item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in  we launched one of the first software product suites on the market that was fully developed and created expressly for web based content and document management 
at the time  content management today considered a critical component of an organization s communication and information technology it infrastructures was an emerging technology used to help companies easily and quickly share information internally or externally using the web 
currently  our solutions which are comprised of universal content management software  content components software and vertical applications help customers worldwide solve real business problems related to efficiently creating  managing and sharing critical information 
our company has strategically grown to become one of the foremost content management software vendors in the industry  having been ranked one of the top three content management software providers by industry analyst firms gartner dataquest  giga information group and aberdeen group 
our customers are primarily located throughout the united states and europe 
we are responsible for developing our current business which was founded in in july  we merged with and into a publicly traded corporation  which was organized under minnesota law in november in july  we acquired the information exchange division currently our content components division or ccd of ebt international  inc formerly inso corporation in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
in july  we acquired select assets of resoft  a leading provider of end to end content management solutions for the real estate and legal industries 
this acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
in april and in march  we acquired certain assets of kinecta corporation and active iq corporation  respectively 
on august   we changed our name to stellent  inc our headquarters is located in eden prairie  minnesota and we have operations or collaborations in australia  france  germany  japan  korea  the netherlands  the united kingdom and in other cities in the united states 
beginning in april and continuing through april  we have implemented several cost cutting measures  including a reduction in work force of approximately since our december quarter 
these restructuring measures were in response to the economic slowdown both in the united states and internationally and were in all functional areas and geographies 
however  we have recently been investing in certain areas in order to expand our customer base and grow our revenues 
because of this  we anticipate that the percentage of expenses as compared to total revenues represented by sales and marketing expenses  research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses will fluctuate from period to period depending primarily on when we hire new personnel  the timing of certain sales and marketing programs  the research programs that we put in place and the potential expansion of operations 
in addition  our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to predict future operating results 
we cannot be certain that we will sustain revenue growth 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the policies described below are particularly important to understanding our financial position and results of operations and may require management to make estimates or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we currently derive all of our revenues from licenses of software products and related services 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements 
product license revenue is recognized under sop when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is probable and supported and the arrangement does not require services that are essential to the functionality of the software 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we determine that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists with respect to a customer under  i a signature license agreement  which is signed by both the customer and us  or  ii a purchase order  quote or binding letter of intent received from and signed by the customer  in which case the customer has either previously executed a signature license agreement with us or will receive a shrink wrap license agreement with the software 
we do not offer product return rights to end users or resellers 
delivery has occurred our software may be either physically or electronically delivered to the customer 
we determine that delivery has occurred upon shipment of the software pursuant to the billing terms of the arrangement or when the software is made available to the customer through electronic delivery 
customer acceptance generally occurs at delivery 
the fee is fixed or determinable if at the outset of the customer arrangement  we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is typically recognized when the arrangement fee becomes due and payable 
fees due under an arrangement are generally deemed fixed and determinable if they are payable within twelve months 
collectibility is probable and supported we determine whether collectibility is probable and supported on a case by case basis 
we may generate a high percentage of our license revenue from our current customer base  for whom there is a history of successful collection 
we assess the probability of collection from new customers based upon the number of years the customer has been in business and a credit review process  which evaluates the customer s financial position and ultimately their ability to pay 
if we are unable to determine from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is probable based upon our review process  revenue is recognized as payments are received 
with regard to software arrangements involving multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative fair value of each element 
our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple element arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to consulting services and post contract customer support pcs components of our license arrangements 
we sell our consulting services separately  and have established vsoe on this basis 
vsoe for pcs is determined based upon the customer s annual renewal rates for these elements 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue from perpetual licenses is recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop  and revenue from pcs is recognized ratably over their respective terms  typically one year 
our direct customers typically enter into perpetual license arrangements 
our content components division generally enters into term based license arrangements with its customers  the term of which generally exceeds one year in length 
we recognize revenue from time based licenses at the time the license arrangement is signed  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  if the term of the time based license arrangement is greater than twelve months 
if the term of the time based license arrangement is twelve months or less  we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license arrangement 
services revenue consists of fees from consulting services and pcs 
consulting services include needs assessment  software integration  security analysis  application development and training 
we bill consulting services fees either on a time and materials basis or on a fixed price schedule 
in general  our consulting services are not essential to the functionality of the software 
our software products are fully functional upon delivery and implementation and generally do not require any significant modification or alteration for customer use 
customers purchase our consulting services to facilitate the adoption of our technology and may dedicate personnel to participate in the services being performed  but they may also decide to use their own resources or appoint other professional service organizations to provide these services 
software products are billed separately from professional services 
we recognize revenue from consulting services as services are performed 
our customers typically purchase pcs annually  and we price pcs based on a percentage of the product license fee 
customers purchasing pcs receive product upgrades  web based technical support and telephone hot line support 
customer advances and billed amounts due from customers in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue 
cost of revenues we expense all manufacturing  packaging and distribution costs associated with product license revenue as cost of revenues 
we expense all technical support service costs associated with service revenue as cost of revenues 
we also expense amortization of capitalized software from acquisitions as cost of revenues 
in january  the fasb issued emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  which requires companies to report reimbursements of out of pocket expenses as revenues and the corresponding expenses incurred as costs of revenues within the income statement 
we report our out of pocket expenses reimbursed by customers as revenue and the corresponding expenses incurred as costs of revenues within the statement of operations 
as a result  this eitf did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
investments in and notes with other companies investments in other equity securities and related notes with other companies in the software industry are classified as long term as we anticipate holding them for more than one year 
we hold less than interest in  and do not directly or indirectly exert significant influence over  any of the respective investees 
a portion of these investments are publicly traded and are deemed by management to be available for sale 
we use the specific identification method to determine cost and fair value for computing gains and losses 
accordingly  these investments are reported at fair value with net unrealized gains or losses reported within shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
no sales of available for sale investments have occurred through march  during fiscal  and  we determined that permanent declines in the value of these publicly traded investments had occurred 
as a result  we recorded write downs of million  million  and million during the years ended march   and  respectively 
investments in other companies also include investments in several non public  start up technology companies for which we use the cost method of accounting 
for the years ended march  and  we determined that a permanent decline in value of certain investments had occurred and recorded a million and million write down on the investments in and advances to these entities 
we determined the permanent declines in value of these public and non public companies using quarterly procedures such as reviewing their operating results and financial position  discussions with company management and review of the overall business climate 
accounts receivable our accounts receivable balances are due from companies across a broad range of industries government  finance  manufacturing  consumer  aerospace and transportation  health care insurance  and high tech telecom 
credit is extended based on evaluation of a customer s financial condition and  generally  collateral is not required 
accounts receivable from sales of services are typically due from customers within days and accounts receivable from sales of licenses are due over terms ranging from days to nine months 
accounts receivable balances are stated at amounts due from customer net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payments terms are considered past due 
we determined our allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade receivables are past due  our previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation to us  and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
we write off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible  and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
no customer accounted for or more of our revenues in the years ended march    and goodwill and other acquired intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
prior to april   goodwill was amortized on a straight line basis over three years 
effective april   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which provides that goodwill  as well as identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives  should not be amortized but reviewed for impairment annually 
accordingly  we ceased amortization of goodwill as of april  at march   other acquired intangible assets represented core technology  customer base  workforce  capitalized software  trademarks  and other intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions  and were amortized on a straight line basis over three to four years 
effective april   we adopted sfas  business combinations  which requires that all business combinations be accounted for utilizing the purchase method of accounting and specifies the criteria to use in determining whether intangible assets identified in purchase accounting must be recorded separately from goodwill 
we determined that our acquired workforce did not meet the separability criteria of sfas  and therefore the net unamortized balance at march  was reclassified to goodwill effective april   and amortization of the balance ceased 
the remaining other acquired intangible assets continue to be amortized on a straight line basis over their remaining  definite useful lives 
the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets is tested for impairment on an annual basis or when factors indicating impairment are present 
we completed our transitional goodwill impairment test on april  and determined that no impairment existed at that time 
we have elected to complete the annual impairment test of goodwill on january of each year 
we engaged an independent outside professional services firm to assist us in our impairment testing of goodwill 
based on this assistance  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test on january  and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill at that time 
additionally  no circumstances occurred during the fourth quarter of the year ended march  which would have created an impairment loss at march  impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of its long lived assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas requires recognition of impairment of long lived assets in the event that events or circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred and when the net book value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributed to such assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
no impairment of long lived assets has occurred through the year ended march  new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which requires the assets  liabilities and results of operations of variable interest entities vie be consolidated into the financial statements of the company that has controlling financial interest 
fin is not anticipated to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
the valuation allowance has been established due to the uncertainty of future taxable income  which is necessary to realize the benefits of the deferred tax assets 
the company had net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately  at march   which begin to expire in these nol s are subject to annual utilization limitations due to prior ownership changes 
realization of the nol carryforwards and other deferred tax temporary differences are contingent on future taxable earnings 
the deferred tax asset was reviewed for expected utilization using a more likely than not approach as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  by assessing the available positive and negative evidence surrounding its recoverability 
accordingly  in fiscal we increased the valuation allowance to fully offset the deferred tax asset 
the increase in the valuation allowance has been recognized as a reduction in paid in capital to the extent that a tax benefit from employee stock option exercises was previously recognized as additional paid in capital 
we will continue to assess and evaluate strategies that will enable the deferred tax asset  or portion there of  to be utilized  and will reduce the valuation allowance appropriately at such time when it is determined that the more likely than not approach is satisfied 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in general  these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience of our management  but may include consideration of industry trends or information from other outside sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates

it is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may not meet or exceed the expectations of current and future public market analysts and investors 
for instance  if revenues or earnings per share do not meet projections  we expect our business  operating results and financial condition to be materially adversely affected and the price of our common stock to decline 
we expect our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
factors that have caused our results to fluctuate in the past  and will likely cause fluctuations in the future  include demand for our products and services  the timing of new product introductions and sales of our products and services  unexpected delays in introducing new products and services  increased expenses  whether related to sales and marketing  research and development or administration  changes in the rapidly evolving market for web content management solutions  the mix of revenues from product licenses and services  as well as the mix of products licensed  the mix of services provided and whether services are provided by our staff or third party contractors  the mix of domestic and international sales  costs related to possible acquisitions of technology or businesses  general economic conditions  and public announcements by our competitors 
in addition  our products are typically shipped when the orders are received  so our license backlog at the beginning of any quarter in the past has represented only a small portion of expected license revenues for that quarter 
further  we recognize a substantial percentage of product license revenues in the last month of the quarter  frequently in the last week or even the last days of the quarter 
as a result  our sales pipeline at the beginning of a quarter may not give us reasonable assurance about the sales that will be closed in that quarter  and the delay or cancellation of any large orders could result in a significant shortfall from anticipated revenues 
since our expenses are relatively fixed in the near term  any shortfall from anticipated revenues could result in significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
as a result of these and other factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of our future performance 
pro forma net income loss per common share in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  we include non gaap supplemental pro forma financial information in our earnings press releases 
our non gaap supplemental pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share results generally exclude from the comparable gaap amounts the effects of acquisition related charges  such as amortization of capitalized software from acquisitions and acquisition and related costs  and certain other charges such as amortization of intangible assets and other  investment impairment and restructuring charges 
our management believes the non gaap supplemental pro forma financial information is useful to investors because it excludes certain non cash expenses and facilitates meaningful comparison of our performance between periods 
in accordance with sfas  we discontinued the amortization of goodwill effective april  the exclusion of amortization expense from the non gaap supplemental pro forma financial information before and after april  enhances the comparability of our results between those periods 
investment impairment charges and restructuring charges occur on an irregular basis  are difficult to predict and often reflect in a single reporting period long term strategic decisions or external factors 
the exclusion of such charges from the non gaap supplemental pro forma financial information enhances comparisons of our tactical performance between periods 
management uses the non gaap supplemental pro forma financial information to evaluate our financial results  develop budgets and manage expenditures 
these non gaap measures may differ from the non gaap measures used by other companies 
the pro forma supplemental financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for the historical financial information presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our pro forma basic net income loss per share is computed by dividing pro forma net income by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares and our pro forma diluted net income loss per share is computed by dividing pro forma net income loss by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares and common share equivalents relating to stock options and warrants  when dilutive 
common stock equivalent shares consist of stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method 
we urge readers to review and consider carefully the gaap financial information contained within our sec filings

the net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in  if not utilized 
the tax reform act of imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of an ownership change of a corporation 
our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards on an annual basis will be limited as a result of ownership changes in connection with the sale of equity securities 
we have provided a valuation allowance against the entire amount of the deferred tax asset as of march  because of uncertainty regarding its full realization 
our accounting for deferred taxes involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a valuation allowance was required  management considered such factors as our history of operating losses  potential future losses and the nature of our deferred tax assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item a liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations and satisfied our capital expenditure requirements primarily through revolving working capital and term loans from banking institutions  private placements and public offerings of securities and proceeds from the sales of assets related to prior lines of business 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended march   compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended march  the increase in cash used in operations is due primarily to the net loss generated by operations 
to date  we have invested our capital expenditures primarily in property and equipment  consisting largely of computer hardware and software 
capital expenditures for the year ended march  and were and million  respectively 
we have also entered into capital and operating leases for facilities and equipment 
we expect that our capital expenditures will increase as our employee base grows 
at march   we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
as of march   we had million in cash and marketable securities and million in working capital 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended march  while net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended march  in march  we completed a public offering of our common stock that raised approximately million in proceeds for us  net of underwriting discounts and offering costs of approximately million 
in april  the underwriters exercised their over allotment option  raising additional net proceeds of approximately million 
we currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for the foreseeable future  particularly through march  on a longer term basis  we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financings or from other sources 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or on any terms  or that any additional financing will not be dilutive 
we continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions that could utilize equity and or cash resources 
such opportunities could develop quickly due to market and competitive factors 
we lease all of our facilities under operating leases that have various expiration dates 
our contractual obligations as of march  consisted of a total of million  of which  million is payable in the next year  million in one to two years  million in three to four years  and million after four years 
the amounts reflected for operating leases represent primarily noncancelable lease payments on our office facility locations 
related party transactions in december we entered into a note receivable of million with a distributor 
through march  the distributor had paid the minimum payments required under the note receivable with its own cash  and at the end of march  it paid off the remaining note receivable with short term bridge financing 
the distributor completely repaid this short term bridge financing in april through a traditional banking relationship 
the short term bridge financing was provided at normal market rates by beartooth capital  a venture financing organization controlled and funded by robert f 
olson  a shareholder and our chairman  president and chief executive officer 
there was no relationship prior to the bridge financing  and there is no existing relationship between beartooth capital and the distributor 
furthermore  we provided no compensation or guarantees to beartooth capital or robert f 
olson for the short term bridge financing  nor were we otherwise involved in this transaction 
during the year ended march   we held investments in five non public companies in which we recognized license revenue of approximately million from companies in which we had an equity investment  including approximately million from active iq in december at march   we had no accounts receivable balance associated from these transactions 
no license revenue was generated in our fiscal year ended march  from any company in which we held an investment 
license revenue recognized for the year ended march  from companies in which we had an equity investment was approximately  we also acquired intellectual property from active iq in april for approximately  which was capitalized and is being amortized over a three year period 
at march  we held remaining investments in two non public start up technology companies  owning approximately and of these companies  and in a publicly traded technology company listed on nasdaq  active iq  of which we owned  excluding warrants 
the value of these investments at march  is approximately million 
we wrote down to zero our investment in active iq during the march quarter 
certain officers and a director also held investment interests in active iq through february approximating  excluding warrants  at which time those investments were sold 
in december and march  we entered into software license agreements with hb fuller company for approximately million and million  respectively 
hb fuller s chief financial officer is a member of our board of directors 
the terms and conditions  including fees  with respect to the hb fuller transactions were substantially similar to those with unaffiliated third parties negotiated at arms length 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation number fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin addresses the disclosure requirements of a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
fin also requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the disclosure requirements of fin were effective for our quarter ended december  the liability recognition requirements are applicable to all guarantees issued or modified after december  other than the additional disclosure requirements related to warranties and our indemnification obligations  this pronouncement is not anticipated to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement sfas 
this statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
additionally  the statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to require prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we utilize the intrinsic value method for stock based employee compensation  and they elected not to adopt the transitional provision to the fair value method under sfas  however  we did adopt the expanded annual disclosure provisions of sfas effective march  we will adopt the interim disclosure provisions of sfas during the first quarter of fiscal year in november  the fasb reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this eitf sets out criteria for whether revenue can be recognized separately from other deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement 
the criteria considers whether the delivered item has stand alone value to the customer  whether the fair value of the delivered item can be reliably determined and the rights of returns for the delivered item 
we are required to adopt this eitf beginning april  the adoption of this eitf is not anticipated to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which requires the assets  liabilities and results of operations of variable interest entities vie be consolidated into the financial statements of the company that has controlling financial interest 
fin is not anticipated to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
risk factors disclosure regarding forward looking statements this form k for the fiscal year ended march  contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management as well as on assumptions made by  and information currently available to  us at the time such statements were made 
when used in this form k  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  intend and similar expressions  as they relate us  are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
although we believe these statements are reasonable  readers of this form k should be aware that actual results could differ materially from those projected by such forward looking statements as a result of the risk factors listed below 
readers of this form k should consider carefully the factors listed below  as well as the other information and data contained in this form k 
we caution the reader  however  that such list of factors under the caption risk factors in our form k may not be exhaustive and that those or other factors  many of which are outside of our control  could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations 
all forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth hereunder 
we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
fluctuations in our operating results may make it difficult to predict our future performance 
while our products and services are not seasonal  our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
if our quarterly revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts  the price of our common stock could fall substantially 
a large part of our sales typically occurs in the last month of a quarter  frequently in the last week or even the last days of the quarter 
if these sales were delayed from one quarter to the next for any reason  our operating results could fluctuate dramatically 
in addition  our sales cycles may vary  making the timing of sales difficult to predict 
furthermore  our infrastructure costs are generally fixed 
as a result  modest fluctuations in revenues between quarters may cause large fluctuations in operating results 
these factors all tend to make the timing of revenues unpredictable and may lead to high period to period fluctuations in operating results 
our quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate for several additional reasons  many of which are outside of our control  including the following demand for our products and services  the timing of new product introductions and sales of our products and services  unexpected delays in introducing new products and services  increased expenses  whether related to sales and marketing  research and development or administration  changes in the rapidly evolving market for web content management solutions  the mix of revenues from product licenses and services  as well as the mix of products licensed  the mix of services provided and whether services are provided by our staff or third party contractors  the mix of domestic and international sales  costs related to possible acquisitions of technology or businesses  general economic conditions  and public announcements by our competitors 
potential acquisitions may be difficult to complete or to integrate and may divert management s attention 
we may seek to acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies that are complementary to our business 
if we identify an appropriate acquisition opportunity  we may be unable to negotiate favorable terms for that acquisition  successfully finance the acquisition or integrate the new business or products into our existing business and operations 
in addition  the negotiation of potential acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses or products may divert management time and resources from our existing business and operations 
to finance acquisitions  we may use a substantial portion of our available cash or we may issue additional securities  which would cause dilution to our shareholders 
we may not be profitable in the future 
our revenues may not grow in future periods and we may not achieve quarterly pro forma profitability 
if we do not regain our pro forma profitability  the market price of our stock may fall 
our ability to regain our pro forma profitable operations depends upon many factors beyond our direct control 
these factors include  but are not limited to the demand for our products  our ability to quickly introduce new products  the level of product and price competition  our ability to control costs  and general economic conditions 
the intense competition in our industry may reduce our future sales and profits 
the market for our products is highly competitive and is likely to become more competitive 
we may not be able to compete successfully in our chosen marketplace  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
additional competition may cause pricing pressure  reduced sales and margins  or prevent our products from gaining and sustaining market acceptance 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition  access to larger customer bases  and substantially more resources than we have 
competitors with greater resources than ours may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new opportunities  changing technology  product standards or customer requirements 
we depend on the continued service of our key personnel 
we are a small company and depend greatly on the knowledge and experience of our senior management team and other key personnel 
if we lose any of these key personnel  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain additional personnel with the highly specialized expertise necessary to generate revenue  engineer  design and support our products and services 
like other software companies  we face intense competition for qualified personnel 
we may not be able to attract or retain such personnel 
we have relied and expect to continue to rely on sales of our universal content management software and content component software products for our revenues 
we currently derive all of our revenues from product licenses and services associated with our system of content management and viewing software products 
the market for content management and viewing software products is new and rapidly evolving 
we cannot be certain that a viable market for our products will continue or that it will be sustainable 
if we do not increase employee productivity and revenues related to our existing products or generate revenues from new products and services  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
we will continue to depend on revenues related to new and enhanced versions of our software products for the foreseeable future 
our success will largely depend on our ability to increase sales from existing products and generate sales from product enhancements and new products 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in upgrading and marketing our existing products or that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products and services 
the market for our products is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
technological advances could make our products less attractive to customers and adversely affect our business 
in addition  complex software product development involves certain inherent risks  including risks that errors may be found in a product enhancement or new product after its release  even after extensive testing  and the risk that discovered errors may not be corrected in a timely manner 
our success depends on our ability to protect our proprietary technology 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  or incur significant expense in doing so  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
any steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate  time consuming and expensive 
we currently have no patents and one pending patent application 
without significant patent or copyright protection  we may be vulnerable to competitors who develop functionally equivalent products 
we may also be subject to claims that our current products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others 
any such claim may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we anticipate that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims due to growth in the number of products and competitors in our industry  and the overlap in functionality of products in different industries 
any infringement claim  regardless of its merit  could be time consuming  expensive to defend  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements may not be available on commercially favorable terms  or at all 
we are not currently involved in any intellectual property litigation 
we rely on trade secret protection  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary information 
despite our attempts to protect our confidential and proprietary information  others may gain access to this information 
alternatively  other companies may independently develop substantially equivalent information 
our products may not be compatible with commercial web browsers and operating systems 
our products utilize interfaces that are compatible with commercial web browsers 
in addition  our stellent content management system is a server based system written in java that functions in both windows nt and unix environments 
we must continually modify our products to conform to commercial web browsers and operating systems 
if our products were to become incompatible with commercial web browsers and operating systems  our business would be harmed 
in addition  uncertainty related to the timing and nature of product introductions or modifications by vendors of web browsers and operating systems may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we could be subject to product liability claims if our products fail to perform to specifications 
if software errors or design defects in our products cause damage to customers data and our agreements do not protect us from related product liability claims  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we could be subject to product liability claims if our security features fail to prevent unauthorized third parties from entering our customers intranet  extranet or internet web sites 
our software products are complex and sophisticated and may contain design defects or software errors that are difficult to detect and correct 
errors  bugs or viruses spread by third parties may result in the loss of market acceptance or the loss of customer data 
our agreements with customers that attempt to limit our exposure to product liability claims may not be enforceable in certain jurisdictions where we operate 
future regulations could be adopted that restrict our business 
federal  state or foreign agencies may adopt new legislation or regulations governing the use and quality of web content 
we cannot predict if or how any future laws or regulations would impact our business and operations 
even though these laws and regulations may not apply to our business directly  they could indirectly harm us to the extent that they impact our customers and potential customers 
significant fluctuation in the market price of our common stock could result in securities litigation against us 
in the past  securities class action litigation has been brought against publicly held companies following periods of volatility in the price of their securities 
if the we were subject to such litigation due to volatility in our stock price  we may incur substantial costs 
such litigation could divert the attention of our senior management away from our business  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may do so in the future 
the market price of our common stock may be affected by each of the following factors  many of which are outside of our control variations in quarterly operating results  changes in estimates by securities analysts  changes in market valuations of companies in our industry  announcements of significant events  such as major sales  acquisitions of businesses or losses of major customers  additions or departures of key personnel  and sales of our equity securities 
our performance will depend on the continuing growth and acceptance of the web 
our products are designed to be used with intranets  extranets and the internet 
if the use of these methods of electronic communication does not grow  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
continued growth in the use of the web will require ongoing and widespread interest in its capabilities for communication and commerce 
its growth will also require maintenance and expansion of the infrastructure supporting its use and the development of performance improvements  such as high speed modems 
the web infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by continued growth 
the ongoing development of corporate intranets depends on continuation of the trend toward network based computing and on the willingness of businesses to reengineer the processes used to create  store  manage and distribute their data 
all of these factors are outside of our control 
our existing shareholders have significant influence over us 
as of march   robert f 
olson  our president  chief executive officer and the chairman  of our board of directors holds approximately of our outstanding common stock 
accordingly  mr 
olson is able to exercise significant control over our affairs 
as a group  our directors and executive officers beneficially own approximately of our common stock 
these persons have significant influence over our affairs  including approval of the acquisition or disposition of assets  future issuances of common stock or other securities and the authorization of dividends on our common stock 
our directors and executive officers could use their stock ownership to delay  defer or prevent a change in control of our company  depriving shareholders of the opportunity to sell their stock at a price in excess of the prevailing market price 
we can issue shares of preferred stock without shareholder approval  which could adversely affect the rights of common shareholders 
our articles of incorporation permit us to establish the rights  privileges  preferences and restrictions  including voting rights  of unissued shares of our capital stock and to issue such shares without approval from our shareholders 
the rights of holders of our common stock may suffer as a result of the rights granted to holders of preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
in addition  we could issue preferred stock to prevent a change in control of our company  depriving shareholders of an opportunity to sell their stock at a price in excess of the prevailing market price 
our shareholder rights plan and certain provisions of minnesota law may make a takeover of stellent difficult  depriving shareholders of opportunities to sell shares at above market prices 
our shareholder rights plan and certain provisions of minnesota law may have the effect of discouraging attempts to acquire stellent without the approval of our board of directors 
consequently  our shareholders may lose opportunities to sell their stock for a price in excess of the prevailing market price 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income on cash and marketable securities is affected by changes in interest rates in the united states 
through march   changes in these rates have had a significant effect on our company 
interest rates earned on invested funds have fallen by over since december we believe that there may be future exposure to interest rate market risk 
our investments are primarily held in commercial paper which are affected by equity price market risk and other factors 
we do not anticipate that exposure to these risks will have a material impact on us  due to the nature of our investments 
we have no history of  and do not anticipate in the future  investing in derivative financial instruments 
most transactions with international customers for our universal content management software  particularly europe  are entered into in foreign currencies whereas most transactions entered into for our content management software are entered into in us dollars 
transactions that are currently entered into in foreign currency are not anticipated to have significant exchange gains or losses 
thus  the exposure to market risk is not material
