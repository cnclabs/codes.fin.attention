overview we are a leading provider of voice over internet protocol  or voip  telephony services 
since we began operations in  we have evolved from a pioneer in developing pc to telephone calling services over the internet to a next generation provider of high quality voice and enhanced telecommunication services throughout the world 
we announced on june   our plan to create netphone global services and netphone cable telephony and operate our business units under these two separate organizations 
our plan  which was approved by the board of directors in july  is intended to provide our shareholders and the investment community with a clearer picture of netphone s operations  and the ability to understand the value elements of our two business lines 
netphone global services delivers voip telephone services to businesses and 
back to contents consumers directly and through its global distribution network of over resellers in over countries  capitalizing on the growth  quality  flexibility and cost advantages of voip technologies 
netphone cable telephony offers cable operators a complete suite of services  enabling them to deliver residential phone service to their customers having comparable quality  features and functionality to that offered by traditional telephone companies 
we have provided segment reporting of the results of these two separate business lines  for the first time in this annual report  as the businesses were segregated in the fourth quarter of fiscal and we began delivering services though these two business units on august  please see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements  and the description of our business included elsewhere in this annual report for a more detailed discussion of this change in our corporate structure 
our segment information for fiscal is provided below netphone global services netphone cable telephony corporate other total in thousands revenues segment income loss capital expenditures total assets substantially all of our revenue has been  and is currently  derived from netphone global services 
in fiscal  our international operations accounted for approximately percent of our revenues  and we expect that our international operations will continue to constitute a significant portion of our revenues 
during the past eighteen months  we have focused the units now in netphone global services on opportunities in emerging markets where we believe our services can command higher margins 
additionally  we have de emphasized relatively low margin services  such as disposable calling cards in the us and wholesale carrier services  and we have significantly reduced our workforce 
although these measures have resulted in a decline in our consolidated revenues since fiscal  our gross margins have increased and we have substantially reduced cash used in operating activities 
we expect the netphone cable telephony business to grow  and we expect it will begin to represent an increasing proportion of our revenue in future years 
netphone cable telephony signed its first contract with liberty cablevision of puerto rico on october  and is actively marketing its services to a wide array of cable operators in the us  europe and latin america who we believe may prefer to buy our services than build their own cable telephony service 
netphone cable telephony works with cable operators to deploy an integrated  tested and operational telephony service  including customized operations support systems  network interfaces  carrier interconnects  telecommunications methods and procedures and real time service assurance  including x network operations center support 
netphone cable telephony offers cable operators a range of strategic deployment and economic alternatives 
we expect our cable telephony agreements will have approximately seven year terms 
our two basic deployment options are described below  although our agreements could include aspects of each of these options hosted service 
in a hosted service arrangement  the operator outsources the planning  development and aspects of the ongoing operation of cable telephony 
the cable operator collects revenue from its customers and pays us a fee on a per subscriber basis for providing our integrated services as well as ongoing maintenance and support fees 
in addition  the cable operator reimburses us for our telecommunications costs plus a margin 
these costs include the set up and ongoing management of local and long distance interconnection and termination  the costs of any dedicated circuits and the recurring cost of maintaining phone numbers and other support services  such as and operator assisted calling 
our fees on a particular contract will depend on a number of variables  including the size of the cable operator s telephony footprint  its ability to sell cable telephony services to its customers  the complexity of the deployment and the amount of local versus long distance termination 
in a hosted service arrangement  the cable operator is responsible for sales and marketing  customer activation  customer support  billing and collection  plant engineering and service technicians and any 
back to contents regulatory costs associated with offering cable telephony 
the cable operator is also responsible for the capital expense associated with the cost of new service installation  the cost of equipment deployed at the subscriber s premises and the upgrade to its existing cable modem termination server 
we bear the capital and operating expenses for the planning  design  procurement  deployment and operation of the voip cable telephony infrastructure 
our capital expenses include the hardware and software costs of integrating our services and systems with the operator s systems 
franchise service 
in the franchise service arrangement  netphone cable telephony initially acquires the exclusive rights to offer cable telephony services in the cable operator s territory  subject to the cable operator s right to buy back the cable telephony rights and subscribers at pre negotiated periods and valuations 
under this arrangement  netphone manages all aspects of the cable telephony offering in the franchise area 
in a franchise services arrangement  cable operators collect the revenues from cable telephony subscribers and pass them through to us 
we pay the cable operators an up front franchise fee based on the number of two way homes passed  a monthly royalty fee based on a percentage of revenues and the costs associated with the deployment of cable telephony 
we may continue to offer services to the cable operator if the operator elects to exercise its buy back option 
our costs include reimbursing the cable operator for the sales and marketing of the cable telephony service and all other direct operational expenses such as customer activation  customer service  billing and collection  plant engineering and service technicians and any other legal and regulatory expenses associated with offering cable telephony 
we will also bear the cost for the set up and ongoing management of local and long distance termination and any other telecommunications administration activities required to interconnect seamlessly with the public switched network 
we are also responsible for the capital expense associated with the cost of new service installation  the cost of equipment deployed at the subscriber s premises and the upgrade to the cable operator s existing cable modem termination server 
our capital expenses include the hardware and software costs of integrating our services and systems with the operator s systems 
to date  we have not recognized significant revenue from our cable telephony business 
we expect to continue to incur significant costs and capital expenditures to fund the expected growth of this business 
the revenues and costs associated with our netphone cable telephony business will depend on the number of customers and contracts we obtain and the type of service we provide to our customers 
while we expect this business will initially be unprofitable  we believe the business will contribute to our earnings in the future as it achieves greater scale 
we cannot predict when this will happen  or be certain that it will happen at all 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
we continually evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  fixed assets  access line costs  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies impact our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
for a further discussion of these and other accounting policies  please see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
revenue recognition 
our international communications service revenue is recognized as service is provided  that is  as minutes are used 
our retail sales revenue  which consists primarily of prepaid calling card revenue  is also recognized as our service is provided  that is  as minutes are used  or when service fees 
back to contents are charged 
we also recognize revenue from pre payments for our services after we conduct evaluations of outstanding remaining pre payment balances and determine  based on historical data  whether such balances are likely to be utilized 
the sale of equipment with software necessary to provide our services is recognized when such products are delivered  collection of payments is assured and there are no significant future obligations 
to date  we have not recognized significant revenue from our cable telephony business  which is now being operated by netphone cable telephony 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
we assess the recoverability of our long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets with finite useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical performance or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant adverse changes in the business climate in which we operate  and loss of a significant contract 
if we determined that the carrying value of certain long lived assets or identifiable intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would determine whether an impairment exists based on the projected undiscounted cash flows 
if the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we would record an impairment loss based on such difference 
expense recognition compared to capitalized costs 
purchases that exceed  provide benefit to future periods and have useful lives greater than one year are capitalized 
all other purchases are expensed in the period the underlying goods and or services are received 
specifically equipment and furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from five to fifteen years  computer software is amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of five years or the term of the related agreement  and software development costs for the internal development of new software products and substantial enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time any additional costs would be capitalized 
we capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining internal use software 
these costs consist of payments made to third parties and the direct compensation costs of only those employees working on such software development projects 
restructuring accruals 
in fiscal   and  we recorded charges related to restructuring within markets  eliminating employee positions and other strategic changes 
the accruals recorded include estimates pertaining to employee termination costs and remaining lease obligations for closed facilities 
although we do not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from these estimates 

back to contents results of operations the following tables set forth certain items in our statement of operations for the periods indicated fiscal year ended july  in thousands total revenue costs and expenses direct cost of revenue exclusive of items shown below selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization restructuring  severance  impairment and other items settlement of cisco litigation acquired in process research and development non cash compensation total costs and expenses income loss from operations interest income  net income loss on equity investments and other expense  net income loss before minority interests minority interests net income loss redeemable common stock accretion net income loss available to common stockholders comparison of fiscal years ended july  and revenue 
our revenue is primarily derived from per minute charges we bill to our customers on a pre paid basis  services to resellers  idt and other carriers  and to a lesser extent from the sale of voip equipment 
our aggregate revenue decreased percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in revenue primarily resulted from the fact that we significantly reduced our sales of disposable calling cards  which generated low margin sales of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal we also significantly reduced our workforce and scaled back certain low margin services  including wholesale termination of telecommunications traffic 
direct cost of revenue  excluding depreciation and amortization 
our direct cost of revenue consists primarily of network costs associated with carrying our customers traffic on our network and leased networks and routing those calls through a local telephone company to reach their final destination 
it also includes the cost of purchasing  storing and shipping voip devices 
most of these costs were incurred within the units that now comprise netphone global services 
direct cost of revenue  excluding depreciation and amortization  decreased by percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  total direct costs increased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal while the dollar cost decrease is primarily attributable to lower revenue and one time connectivity reserve reversals  which are no longer necessary due to service disconnections  we are also realizing cost reductions from a more efficiently structured and utilized network and from more aggressively priced termination contracts 
the slight increase in the percentage of direct costs compared to revenue is due to the remaining fixed network backbone infrastructure costs still required to service a significantly reduced revenue base 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of the salaries of our employees and associated benefits  the expenses associated with acquiring customers  including commissions paid to our sales force  advertising costs  research and development costs  travel  entertainment  referral fees and amounts paid in connection with revenue sharing arrangements and the costs of insurance  legal  rent  utilities  shipping  consulting and other items 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
back to contents decreased percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily due to the aforementioned restructurings 
as a percentage of total revenue  these costs decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal the portion of selling  general and administrative expense driven by payroll costs decreased during fiscal as the number of full time employees on staff dropped from on july  to on july  selling  general and administrative expenses related to our netphone cable telephony business were million in fiscal we expect to incur significant selling  general and administrative expense to continue to fund the growth of our netphone cable telephony business in the future 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased percent  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to an impairment charge for long lived assets recognized during the quarter ended april  and to the lower demand for capital spending during fiscal  which came from more efficient utilization of existing assets 
as a percentage of total revenue  depreciation and amortization decreased to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal restructuring  severance  impairment and other items 
restructuring  severance  impairment and other items decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the following table summarizes the charges included in restructuring  severance  impairment and other items in the statements of operations year ended july  in thousands workforce reductions exit and other costs separation agreements of former ceo  cfo and coo impairment charges loss on assets held for sale reserve adjustments total in the first half of fiscal  both our chief executive officer and chief financial officer resigned 
these events led to the development of an overall long term restructuring plan  which would scale down our operations  organize us to compete more efficiently  and allow us to redirect our focus and resources towards a more profitable business plan 
during the two years since  we have executed our plan and implemented a series of strategic workforce reductions  sold business units and long lived assets  as well as impaired such assets and goodwill 
as we continue to execute our plan we are realizing lower costs and identifying more reliable revenue opportunities 
while the majority of our restructuring costs were incurred during fiscals and  we continued to incur these costs during fiscal however  we expect that these expenditures will decrease prospectively 
these costs were funded through current operations 
in april  norman klugman  our former chief operating officer  announced his intention to resign and terminated his employment with us in july during fiscal  we recorded a million charge related to a severance agreement reached with mr 
klugman 
mr 
klugman waived all of his rights under his employment agreement 
as a result of our plan to restructure our operations and eliminate various lines of development  an impairment review of our long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets was conducted as of april   in accordance with sfas no 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded impairment charges as indicated below 
the impairment charges were calculated as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeded their fair values 
fair value was estimated using the present value of expected future cash flows 
the decrease in restructuring  impairment  and other items in fiscal compared with fiscal  is due mainly to various impairment charges taken in fiscal  including an million impairment of assets  an million impairment of goodwill and a million impairment of intangible assets 

back to contents additionally  we initiated several restructurings during fiscal  which resulted in higher charges related to workforce reductions in fiscal compared to fiscal also  the charges related to the separation agreements of the former ceo and cfo decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal as components of the agreements became fully amortized 
also  exit costs were higher in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to charges incurred for exiting various locations and eliminating various equipment and network build outs 
lastly  reserve adjustments reduced fiscal charges due to settlement of various contractual obligations for amounts less than previously established reserves 
settlement of cisco litigation 
on march   we filed suit in the united states district court for the district of new jersey against cisco systems  inc and a cisco executive who had been a member of the board of directors of adir technologies  inc  our majority owned subsidiary 
the suit arose out of the relationships that had been created in connection with cisco s and our original investments in adir and out of adir s subsequent purchase of netspeak  inc in august the parties settled the suit and all related claims against cisco and the cisco executive in exchange for i the transfer  during the first quarter of fiscal  to us of cisco s and softbank asia infrastructure fund s respective percent and percent interests in adir  and ii the payment by cisco  during such quarter  of million to us and adir 
as a result of this settlement  we recognized a gain of million during fiscal consisting of a million reduction in minority interests as a result of the transfer of the adir shares  and the receipt of settlement proceeds of million less compensation expense of million 
no income taxes have been provided for with respect to the gain as we have sufficient net operating loss carryforwards to offset the gain 
in fiscal  we recorded million of legal and other expenses related to this settlement 
acquired in process research and development 
for fiscal  purchased in process research and development  or ipr d  ipr d represents the value assigned in a purchase business combination to research and development projects of the acquired business that had commenced but had not yet been completed at the date of acquisition and which have no alternative future use 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  as clarified by fasb interpretation no 
 amounts assigned to ipr d meeting the above stated criteria must be charged to expense as part of the allocation of the purchase price of the business combination 
accordingly  charges totaling million were recorded during fiscal as part of the allocation of the purchase price related to the acquisition of netspeak by adir  our majority owned subsidiary 
ipr d relates primarily to advanced telephony software products for internet protocol  or ip  networks 
the valuation of ipr d included both cost and income valuation approaches  and utilized replacement cost and discounted cash flow methodologies for various aspects of the analysis 
the calculations were based on estimates of operating earnings  capital charges  and working capital requirements to support the cash flows attributed to the technologies 
discount rates reflecting the stage of development  complexity and the risk associated with each technology were used to value ipr d 
development of the major components of the ipr d were completed during the second quarter of fiscal effective february   further research was suspended while adir reevaluated the products anticipated attractiveness relative to current market conditions 
it was ultimately determined that the aspects of the ipr d necessary to bolster the technological development of netphone cable telephony s product offerings were in place and no further development related to the ipr d would be initiated 
non cash compensation 
non cash compensation charges from the issuance of stock options decreased percent from million in fiscal to million for fiscal this decrease was primarily caused by lower compensation expense related to fewer below market price options that vested during fiscal as compared to a larger number of below market price options that became fully vested in fiscal in addition  due to our various restructurings  a number of previously granted options have been forfeited  which has served to further reduce non cash compensation expense in fiscal on december   the board of directors approved the repricing of options outstanding under netphone s amended and restated stock option and incentive plan 
the repriced options are subject to variable accounting treatment and therefore must be marked to market each quarter 
during fiscal and we recorded charges of million and million respectively  related to these repriced options 
if our stock price increases  we will continue to incur charges until the options are exercised 
lastly  we recorded million and million during fiscal and  respectively  for the amortization of the discount of adir shares sold to 
back to contents netphone and adir employees in fiscal the total discount of approximately million is being amortized over the vesting period of such shares 
as of july   million of this discount has been amortized 
the remaining unamortized discount of million will be written off against the remaining minority interest balance during fiscal when we will liquidate adir 
for a further discussion of adir  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
as a percentage of total revenue  non cash compensation costs increased from percent for fiscal to percent for fiscal this increase was due primarily to a percent decrease in revenue 
income loss from operations 
we recorded a loss from operations of million in fiscal compared to income from operations of million in fiscal the decrease in loss from operations is primarily due to operating expenses decreasing at a faster rate than revenue  lower restructuring  severance  impairment and other related expenses  and a net gain of million from the settlement of the cisco litigation recorded during fiscal interest income  net 
interest income consists primarily of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents 
interest income decreased percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the reduction primarily resulted from lower cash balances and interest rate reductions 
income loss on equity investments and other expense  net 
income loss on equity investments and other expense  net  which includes the losses or gains resulting from non operating transactions  was a loss of million in fiscal and income of million in fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a loss relating to an other than temporary decline in value of several of our cost method investments resulting in a charge of approximately million  as well as a loss relating to the sale of equipment of approximately million 
the other income realized in fiscal is due primarily to a mark to market gain on shares of our common stock held by a lender  as is more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
comparison of fiscal years ended july  and revenue 
our aggregate revenue decreased percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in revenue was primarily due to management s active restructuring of our business during the fiscal year 
we diminished our activities in certain sales channels  such as carrier services  where we were experiencing relatively low gross margins and focused our activities on other market opportunities  such as international channel sales and distribution  that have generated relatively higher gross margins 
we significantly reduced our workforce and scaled back certain unprofitable services  including our sale of disposable calling cards and wholesale termination of telecommunications traffic 
direct cost of revenue  excluding depreciation and amortization 
our direct cost of revenue consists primarily of network costs associated with carrying our customers traffic on our network and leased networks  routing their calls through a local telephone company to reach their final destination  the wholesale costs of internet telephony devices  ad server costs and e mail box hosting fees 
it also includes the cost of purchasing  storing and shipping internet telephony equipment 
direct cost of revenue  excluding depreciation and amortization  decreased by percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  direct costs decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to the effective restructuring of our network for more focused and intensive use  aggressive price negotiations of termination costs and the impact of removing our subsidization of free minutes to previous strategic partners such as microsoft and yahoo 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of the salaries of our employees and associated benefits  the expenses associated with acquiring customers  including commissions paid to our sales partners  advertising costs  research and development costs  travel  entertainment  referral fees and amounts paid in connection with revenue sharing arrangements and the costs of insurance  legal  rent  utilities  shipping  consulting and other items 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  these costs decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  we incurred a one time non recurring termination charge of million related to marketing and advertising expenses associated with the termination of our agreement with 
back to contents yahoo 
in addition  selling  general and administrative costs have decreased as a result of operating more efficiently and by leveraging our existing infrastructure to support future growth 
the portion of selling  general and administrative costs driven by payroll costs has decreased markedly during fiscal as the number of full time employees on staff dropped from on july  to on july  depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to a percent increase in capital equipment purchased during fiscal  to million  from million purchased during fiscal however  the overall increase in depreciation and amortization in fiscal was mitigated by the impact of a million impairment of long lived assets recorded on april  as a percentage of total revenue  depreciation and amortization increased to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal restructuring  severance  impairment and other items 
restructuring  severance  impairment and other items increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the following table summarizes the charges included in restructuring  severance  impairment and other items in the statements of operations year ended july  in thousands workforce reductions exit and other costs separation agreements of former ceo  cfo and coo impairment charges total this increase was attributable to several restructurings during fiscal  which resulted in higher charges related to the various workforce reductions 
additionally  during fiscal we incurred charges related to the terms dictated in the separation agreements of the former ceo and cfo 
when an indicator of impairment of our long lived assets exists  we review the recorded value of such assets to determine if the future cash flows to be derived from these assets will be sufficient to recover the remaining recorded asset values 
we considered the resignations of the chief executive and chief financial officers in the first half of fiscal and the plan to restructure our operations and eliminate various lines of development to be indicators of potential impairment 
as a result  an impairment charge of million was recognized during the third quarter of fiscal when it was determined that the future undiscounted cash flows of our long lived and intangible assets were estimated to be insufficient to recover their related carrying values 
as such  the carrying values of these assets were written down to our estimated fair value 
fair value was estimated using the present value of expected future cash flows 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we restructured the operations of our aplio subsidiary 
in connection with this decision  we wrote off substantially all of aplio s intangible and fixed assets as their values would not be recoverable  resulting in a charge of approximately million 
separately  unrelated to aplio  we determined that we would no longer receive any future benefits on certain assets  primarily capitalized software and a trademark 
therefore  we wrote off these assets and incurred impairment charges of approximately million 
settlement of cisco litigation 
on march   we filed suit in the united states district court for the district of new jersey against cisco systems  inc and a cisco executive who had been a member of the adir board of directors 
the suit arose out of the relationships that had been created in connection with cisco s and netphone s original investments in adir and out of adir s subsequent purchase of netspeak  inc in august we recorded million of legal and other expenses related to the settlement during fiscal in august  netphone and its adir subsidiary consummated the settlement of their lawsuit 
as a result of this settlement  we recognized a gain of during fiscal acquired in process research and development 
purchased in process research and development  or ipr d  represents the value assigned in a purchase business combination to research and development 
back to contents projects of the acquired business that had commenced but had not yet been completed at the date of acquisition and which have no alternative future use 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  as clarified by fasb interpretation no 
 amounts assigned to ipr d meeting the above stated criteria must be charged to expense as part of the allocation of the purchase price of the business combination 
accordingly  charges totaling million were recorded during fiscal as part of the allocation of the purchase price related to the acquisition of netspeak 
ipr d relates primarily to advanced telephony software products for internet protocol  or ip  networks 
the valuation of the ipr d included both cost and income valuation approaches  and utilized replacement cost and discounted cash flow methodologies for various aspects of the analysis 
the calculations were based on estimates of operating earnings  capital charges  and working capital requirements to support the cash flows attributed to the technologies 
discount rates reflecting the stage of development  complexity and the risk associated with each technology were used to value ipr d 
development of the major components of the ipr d were completed during the second quarter of fiscal effective february   further research was suspended while adir reevaluated the product s anticipated attractiveness relative to current market conditions 
it was ultimately determined that the aspects of the ipr d necessary to bolster the technological development of netphone cable telephony s product offerings were in place and no further development related to the ipr d would be initiated 
non cash compensation 
the non cash compensation charge from the issuance of stock options decreased percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to staff reductions and ultimate cancellation of employee options 
as a percentage of total revenue  these costs increased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal on december   the board of directors approved the repricing of options outstanding under netphone s amended and restated stock option and incentive plan 
during fiscal  the company recorded million of compensation expense related to this repricing 
the repriced options are subject to variable accounting treatment and therefore must be marked to market each quarter 
the company will continue to incur these charges over the vesting period and with respect to repricings  until the options are exercised 
loss from operations 
loss from operations was million in fiscal as compared to a loss from operations of million in fiscal the increase was driven by increased charges relating to acquired in process research and development and restructuring  severance  impairment  and other items  partially offset set by reduced direct cost of revenue and selling  general and administrative expenses 
interest income  net 
interest income consists primarily of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents 
interest income decreased percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in interest income primarily resulted from lower cash balances and interest rate reductions 
we anticipate reduced interest income from interest bearing accounts due to lower interest rates and cash balances 
loss on equity investments and other expense  net 
loss on equity investments and other expense  net decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  all  yahoo shares were sold for gross proceeds of approximately million  resulting in a gain of approximately million 
in the second quarter of fiscal   shares of speechworks were sold for gross proceeds of approximately million  resulting in a loss of approximately million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a loss relating to an other than temporary decline in value for several of our cost method investments  resulting in a charge to other expense of approximately million and a loss relating to the sale of equipment of approximately million 
during fiscal  we recorded a writedown of approximately million relating to the other than temporary decline in the value of our investment in shares of yahoo  inc common stock 
in addition  we recorded a loss relating to an other than temporary decline in value for our equity investments in alonet sa  webley and webdialogs  totaling approximately million 
also  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a loss relating to an other than temporary decline in value for several of our other cost method investments of approximately million 
lastly  we recorded a net gain of million relating to equity collars during the year ended july  the net gain was comprised of income of approximately million recorded in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of the change in value of the time value component of 
back to contents the equity collars  which was partially offset by a loss of approximately million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal upon termination of the equity collars 
related party transactions idt corporation 
in fiscal  and  we provided carrier services to idt corporation  our controlling shareholder  of million  million and million  respectively  and sold disposable calling cards to idt affiliates totaling million  million and million  respectively 
in fiscal  services provided to idt and its affiliates accounted for percent of total revenue compared to percent and percent in fiscal and  respectively 
as we continue to de emphasize domestic disposable calling cards and services provided to carriers  we anticipate the percentage of sales generated by transactions between netphone global services and idt and its affiliates to continue to decline 
going forward  we expect netphone cable telephony to enter into service and other agreements with idt and its affiliates related to our cable telephony activities 
in fiscal  and  we purchased wholesale carrier services from idt of million  million  and million  respectively 
carrier charges paid to idt represent percent of our direct costs of revenue in fiscal compared to percent and percent in fiscal and  respectively 
the reduction in these percentages is a reflection of our de emphasis of services provided to carriers and diversification of the sources of our carrier services 
our corporate headquarters and several other facilities are leased from idt 
in fiscal  and  we paid idt million  million  and million  respectively  in facilities lease payments 
the due from to idt balances represent net amounts due from to idt to by us principally for wholesale carrier telecommunication services and lease payments 
on july   we owed idt million 
on july   idt owed us million 
the average balance we owed to idt during the years ended july  and july   was and million  respectively 
we work with idt solutions formerly winstar to help us procure inbound telecommunications phone numbers for our cable telephony subsidiary 
idt solutions also assists us to establish interconnects with local carriers as we look to roll out services through netphone cable telephony 
on occasion  we have aggregated long distance minutes and other services purchases with idt 
we outsource some of our administrative functions to idt when we believe idt can provide resources more efficiently and cost effectively then we could do it ourselves 
for example  idt provides tax consulting services  investment management services  payroll and also internal audit support services 
on occasion  we provide outsourced services to idt  based on the need for such services 
fees for services are negotiated on a cost recovery basis 
pursuant to the memorandum of understanding executed or october   we will be required to issue million shares of class a common stock to idt at the time we execute our definitive telecommunications services agreement with idt 
the shares will be held in escrow to secure idt s performance obligations under the telecommunications services agreement and will be released to idt in equal annual installments over five years 
the shares are subject to variable accounting treatment and  therefore  must be marked to market each quarter  resulting in a quarterly charge to earnings equal to the aggregate market value of one fourth of the shares that will vest on each anniversary of the agreement 
these charges may materially reduce our earnings 
based on the closing price of our common stock on october   the aggregate amount of such charge over the five years would be million 
liquidity and capital resources as of july  we reported total cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash  and marketable securities of million and working capital of million 
as of july   of the million  million in short term restricted cash and million in long term restricted cash is held as collateral for various letter of credit obligations  the majority of which related to our purchase of aplio  sa from the stockholders of aplio
