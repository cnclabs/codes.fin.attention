item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our franchisees could take actions that could harm our business franchisees are independent operators and are not employed by us 
we provided training and support to franchisees  but any number of factors beyond our control may diminish the quality of franchised restaurant operations 
consequently  franchisees may not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or may not hire and train qualified managers and other restaurant personnel 
if franchisees do not operate in accordance with our standards  our image and reputation may suffer materially and system wide sales could significantly decline 
also  the presence of franchised restaurants may limit our ability to expand in a desired market 
our operations are susceptible to changes in food availability and costs  which could adversely affect our operating results our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food costs 
we rely on sysco corporation  a national distributor  as the primary supplier of our food 
any increase in distribution prices or failure of sysco to perform could cause our food costs to increase 
there also could be a significant short term disruption in our supply chain if sysco failed to meet our distribution requirements or our relationship was terminated 
further  various factors beyond our control  including adverse weather conditions  governmental regulation  production  availability and seasonality may affect our food costs or cause a disruption in our supply 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices  and a failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
changes in consumer preferences or discretionary consumer spending could negatively impact our results of operations our continued success depends  in part  upon the popularity of the menu items served in the champps environment and our dining style 
shifts in consumer preferences away from our cuisine or dining style could materially and adversely affect our future profitability 
in addition  our success depends to a significant extent on numerous factors affecting discretionary consumer spending  including economic conditions  disposable consumer income and consumer confidence 
adverse changes in these factors could reduce guest traffic or impose practical limits on pricing  either of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
health concerns relating to the consumption of our food products could negatively impact our results of operations we are subject to the risk that consumer preferences could be affected by health concerns about the consumption of particular food products 
beef and chicken are the key ingredients in many of our menu items 
negative publicity concerning food quality  illness and injury  publication of government or industry findings concerning food products served by us  or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one restaurant or a limited number of restaurants may adversely affect demand for our food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants 
if we lose the services of our president or other key associates  our business could suffer our future success significantly depends on the continued service and performance of william h 
baumhauer  our president and chief executive officer  as well as other key executives 
our future performance will depend on our ability to motivate and retain mr 
baumhauer and other executive officers and key associates  such as regional directors of operation  restaurant general managers and kitchen managers 
competition for these associates is intense 
in may  mr 
baumhauer s employment agreement was amended and extended through june  the loss of the services of mr 
baumhauer or members of our senior management and key associates or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed could materially harm our business 
we do not currently have key person life insurance for any of our officers or directors 
we face indemnification liability from our predecessor companies in connection with the spin off in late from daka international  inc  we assumed certain contingent liabilities of daka and its subsidiary  daka  inc in march  a former associate of daka was awarded approximately million in compensatory damages  million in punitive damages and million in legal fees in a jury trial based on the associate s claim of negligent supervision and retaliation due to alleged conduct that occurred in at a former daka food service location 
the amount of these awards accrues interest at a rate of per annum 
on september   daka filed a notice of appeal with the court of appeals for the district of columbia and this matter is now pending in that court 
on february   daka also filed its notice of appeal in connection with the court s award of legal fees and this matter is pending in that court 
under our post closing covenant agreement with daka  we have been responsible for handling the defense of these claims  including the appeals 
at june   our consolidated balance sheet included our accrual of approximately million in respect of the potential award in this matter and related legal expenses 
if daka does not prevail on its appeals in substantially all material respects  we would be required to take a charge to net income in the amount by which our final payout exceeds our reserve for this matter  and this charge could be a significant amount in relation to our income from operations at the time 
in addition  the payment of a substantial amount of cash as a result of an adverse ruling by the court of appeals could result in delays in our expansion plans or could result in our needing to seek additional financing sources to support our expansion or our day to day operations 
it is also possible that daka could settle this case in advance of a final judicial determination  and the settlement amount itself could be substantial 
depending on the timing and nature of the ruling by the court of appeals  or the timing of any settlement of this case  we also could incur substantial additional legal expenses in pursuing daka s appeal and the ultimate resolution of this matter 
we are also engaged in various tax audits arising from the operations of these predecessor companies 
in december  the state of florida proposed to assess subsidiaries of daka million in unpaid state sales taxes  and an additional million in penalties and interest through december we are contractually obligated to indemnify daka for this matter  and are currently protesting this proposed assessment 
a final determination of this matter requiring a substantial payment by us would have the same adverse consequences as a substantial final payment in the lawsuit referred to in the preceding paragraph 
we reserve in our financial statements for these and other matters  which reserves are reviewed periodically to determine their adequacy 
although we believe that our current reserves are proper under generally accepted accounting principles in light of our analysis of the outcome of the related matters  there can be no guarantees that we will not have to recognize additional expenses as these matters are ultimately resolved  which expenses could be significant 
litigation could have a material adverse affect on our business we are subject to complaints or allegations from current and former or prospective associates from time to time 
in addition  we are the subject of complaints or litigation from guests alleging illness  injury or other food quality  health or operational concerns 
we may be adversely affected by publicity resulting from such allegations  regardless of whether such allegations are valid  whether we are liable  or whether such allegations involve one of our franchisees or licensees 
a lawsuit or claim could result in an adverse decision or result that could have a material adverse affect on our business 
we are also subject to state dram shop laws and regulations  which generally provide that a person injured by an intoxicated person may seek to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcohol to such person 
while we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance  we may still be subject to a judgment in excess of our insurance coverage and we may not be able to obtain or continue to maintain such insurance coverage at reasonable costs  or at all 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  it could reduce our ability to capitalize on our brand names pursuant to a master agreement dated february   we acquired the champps  champ s and champps americana service mark  trademark and trade name 
our business prospects will depend  in part  on our ability to develop favorable consumer recognition of the champps name and logo 
our trademarks could be infringed in ways that leave us without redress  such as by imitation 
in addition  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how  and we employ various methods to protect our concepts and recipes 
however  such methods may not afford adequate protection and others could independently develop similar know how or obtain access to our know how  concepts and recipes 
moreover  we may face claims of infringement that could both interfere with our use of our proprietary know how  concepts  recipes  trade secrets or trademarks or subject us to damages 
defending against such claims may be costly and  if unsuccessful  may prevent us from continuing to use such proprietary information in the future 
although champps  champ s and champps americana are federally registered trademarks  there are other restaurants and bars that operate under similar names 
if these restaurants or bars are affected by negative publicity and consumers confuse these competitors with our champps branded restaurants  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we are subject to extensive governmental regulations concerning the sale and serving of alcoholic beverages and wages paid to our associates that could adversely affect our operations and our ability to expand and develop our restaurants the restaurant industry is subject to various federal  state and local governmental regulations 
while at this time we have been able to obtain and maintain the necessary governmental licenses  permits and approvals  the failure to maintain these licenses  permits and approvals  including food and liquor licenses  could adversely affect our operating results 
difficulties or failure in obtaining the required licenses and approvals could delay or result in our decision to cancel the opening of new restaurants 
local authorities may suspend  revoke or deny renewal of our food and liquor licenses if they determine that our conduct does not meet applicable standards or if there are changes in regulations 
for fiscal  approximately of our restaurant food and beverage sales was attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages  and we believe our ability to serve these beverages is an important factor in attracting guests 
alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants to apply to a state authority and  in certain locations  county or municipal authorities for a license or permit to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises and to provide service for extended hours and on sundays 
typically  licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time  which could include sales to minors or intoxicated persons 
alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of daily operations of our restaurants 
the failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain liquor or food service licenses would adversely affect the restaurant s operations 
various federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our associates and affect our operating costs 
these laws include minimum wage requirements  overtime pay  unemployment tax rates  workers compensation rates  and citizenship requirements 
additional government imposed increases in minimum wages  overtime pay  paid leave of absence and mandated health benefits  increased tax reporting and tax payment requirements for associates who receive gratuities or a reduction in the number of states that allow tips to be credited toward minimum wage requirements could harm our operating results 
on june   the united states supreme court ruled that the internal revenue service irs can use aggregate tip estimates to ensure that the employer is paying fica taxes on allegedly underreported tips 
under the ruling  the irs does not need to examine individual associates records and it is permissible for the irs to estimate the amount of cash tips given to associates based on tips included on credit card receipts 
the reporting of tips is the responsibility of the associates receiving the tips 
we encourage our associates to abide by the law and report of the tips that they receive 
while we believe our associates adequately report tips  we have implemented tip reporting policies and procedures that are in full compliance with the recommended irs policies and procedures as defined in our tip reporting alternative commitment agreement that was executed by the company and the irs in fiscal our success depends on our ability to compete effectively in the restaurant industry the restaurant industry is highly competitive 
although we believe that our operating concept  quality of food  ambiance and overall dining experience differentiates us from competitors  we may be unable to compete effectively with new restaurant concepts or with larger  better established competitors  which have substantially greater financial resources and operating histories than ours 
we may not be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to fully utilize our income tax operating loss and credit carryforwards as of june   we had federal net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million and fica and targeted job tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
the federal nol s expire at various times through and the fica tip and targeted job tax credits expire at various times through while we expect to fully utilize the carryforwards to reduce our income tax liabilities  future income may not be sufficient for full utilization of the carryforwards 
strategic alternatives from time to time  as a matter of standard business practice  the management of the company investigates various strategic alternatives in an attempt to maximize shareholder value 
these strategic alternatives include potential acquisitions  mergers with other companies and go private transactions 
as of september   the company has not entered into any definitive agreements relative to any strategic alternative that has been considered or brought before management 
should a strategic alternative be presented that has the potential to maximize shareholder value  the board of directors would assign an independent committee to determine the merits of the proposed transaction and seek shareholder approval  if necessary

item legal proceedings 
we assumed certain contingent liabilities of daka and its subsidiary  daka  inc in connection with their spin off 
in the third quarter of fiscal  a washington  dc superior court jury awarded a former daka associate million in compensatory damages  million in punitive damages and a subsequent award of million for legal fees and costs  based on the associate s claim of negligent supervision and retaliation  due to alleged conduct that occurred in at a former daka food service location 
while daka was formerly a subsidiary of daka international and while daka international is now a subsidiary of compass group  plc  the events at issue in the case took place while a predecessor company of champps owned daka 
on september   daka filed a notice of appeal with the court of appeals for the district of columbia 
the company may be liable for the payment of any amounts ultimately due by daka upon final determination of the case 
the company has not accrued any amounts related to the punitive damages in this matter based upon relevant legal precedents the company believes  and its outside legal counsel concurs  that the punitive damages will not be upheld 
the company has accrued approximately million associated with this matter based on our estimate of the ultimate compensatory damages and legal fees anticipated to be awarded 
revisions to our estimate may be made in the future and will be reported in the period in which additional information is known 
based upon our analysis  and the advice of outside legal counsel  the company believes that the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the state of florida proposed to assess subsidiaries of daka million in unpaid state sales taxes  and an additional million in penalties and interest through december we are contractually obligated to indemnify daka for this matter and are currently protesting this proposed assessment 
we believe that daka has meritorious legal and factual defenses to these matters and have submitted the same to the state of florida 
further  we are engaged in various other actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we believe based on management s analysis and the advice of outside counsel that the ultimate collective outcome of these other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as of june   we had an aggregate of approximately million reserved for liabilities associated with predecessor companies  million of which are reserved for the daka associate judgment noted above and million for the proposed sales tax assessment noted above 
these amounts have been reserved to fund the probable amounts that we expect to pay 
we have not reserved for the entire amounts of such judgments or claims based on our internal analysis and consultation with outside counsel

for purposes of this form k and financial reporting purposes  the company has been treated as if it was a stand alone entity for all periods presented 
certain amounts have been reclassified for earlier periods to conform to the fiscal presentation 
the reclassifications have no impact on net income loss or earnings loss per share 
the selected consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto of the company and management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition included elsewhere in this annual report on form k

our restaurants offer an extensive and varied menu in each of four distinct day parts lunch  after work  dinner and late night 
we believe that the flexibility of our multiple day part model  the diversity and quality of our freshly prepared menu items  our unique entertainment and uncompromising service have created an attractive  high sales volume restaurant model that provides us with considerable growth opportunities to develop our brand nationwide 
the original champps concept began operations in and grew to eight restaurants by december in  william h 
baumhauer  the chief executive officer and president of daka international  inc  a large publicly traded food service management and restaurant company  led daka s purchase of champps as an addition to daka s portfolio of restaurant concepts 
as part of a corporate restructuring in  daka spun off its foodservice business and the shareholders retained ownership of the restaurant businesses  which included champps and several other businesses including fuddruckers restaurants 
the new company was named unique casual restaurants  inc during and the first half of  unique casual restaurants sold or closed its businesses other than champps and changed its name to champps entertainment  inc shortly thereafter  mr 
baumhauer  who had left the daka organization in may  was recruited back to champps as president and chief executive officer 
upon his return  mr 
baumhauer hired a new management team  consolidated our headquarters  implemented procedures to improve operational and financial reporting procedures  standardized the purchasing process and established new associate training and retention practices 
as a result of the changes we implemented following mr 
baumhauer s return in  our restaurant level operating profit increased million or from million for fiscal to million for fiscal as a percent of restaurant sales  our restaurant level operating profit margin increased from in fiscal to in fiscal our restaurants open throughout fiscal generated average unit sales of approximately million  among the highest in the casual dining industry 
as a result of our existing high unit volumes  we do not expect that increases in comparable restaurant sales will provide significant sources for overall growth in our revenue  and our comparable restaurant sales will continue to fluctuate over time 
instead  we anticipate that our disciplined expansion strategy will be the principal driver for our future revenue growth 
we opened seven restaurants in fiscal and expect to open six to eight restaurants in fiscal we believe that there are significant opportunities to expand our concept both in our existing markets and in new markets throughout the united states 
the majority of our growth will be in existing markets  which will enable us to leverage costs and gain efficiencies associated with regional supervision  marketing  purchasing and hiring in these markets 
our growth strategy will have several impacts on our financial results  in addition to increases in our restaurant sales 
as we open more restaurants  our aggregate pre opening expense will increase 
pre opening expense has historically been approximately million per location 
because our openings will not necessarily be spaced evenly throughout a fiscal year  our pre opening expense will fluctuate  possibly significantly  on a quarterly basis 
in addition  new restaurants tend to have higher operating costs as a percentage of restaurant sales than do more established restaurants  which will impact negatively our overall operating margins in periods following large numbers of restaurant openings 
on the other hand  because a substantial portion of our general and administrative expense does not increase proportionately with increases in restaurant sales and because we believe that our corporate infrastructure is substantially in place to support our planned growth  we expect that general and administrative expense as a percentage of restaurant sales will be positively impacted over time as we grow our restaurant base 
we are not pursuing new franchise arrangements as part of our growth strategy and do not expect franchising and royalty revenue to be significant in the future 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
the estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable 
items significantly impacted by estimates and judgments include  but are not limited to  representations  warranties and indemnities provided in connection with the spin off of daka international  inc in and the subsequent sale of our fuddruckers business unit in  the useful lives and recoverability of our long lived assets such as property  equipment and intangibles  fair value attributed to assets and liabilities of acquired businesses  valuation of deferred tax assets  self insured risks relating to workers compensation and general liability claims and legal liabilities 
loss contingencies and self insurance reserves we maintain accrued liabilities and reserves relating to the resolution of certain contingent obligations and reserves for self insurance 
significant contingencies include those related to litigation and state tax assessments 
we account for contingent obligations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires that we assess each contingency to determine estimates of the degree of probability and range of possible settlement 
those contingencies that are deemed to be probable and where the amount of such settlement is reasonably estimable are accrued in our financial statements 
if only a range of loss can be determined  we accrue to the best estimate within that range  if none of the estimates within that range is better than another  we accrue to the low end of the range 
we determine reserves for self insurance based on the insurance companies incurred loss estimates and management s judgment 
the assessment of loss contingencies and self insurance reserves is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events 
contingencies are reviewed at least quarterly to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related financial statement disclosure 
the ultimate settlement of loss contingencies and self insurance reserves may differ materially from amounts we have accrued in our financial statements 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets including property  equipment and related identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
under sfas no 
 an assessment is made to determine if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows from the use of the assets and eventual disposition is less than the carrying value 
if the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized based on fair value 
we evaluate impairment of goodwill and other unidentifiable intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 we are required to assess impairment at least annually by means of a fair value based test 
at june   we evaluated our goodwill and determined that the goodwill was not impaired 
the determination of fair value requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates related to our business and is highly subjective 
actual amounts realized through operations or upon disposition of related assets may differ significantly from our estimate 
leases we lease most of our properties including our corporate office 
we account for our leases under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for leases and subsequent amendments which requires that leases be evaluated and classified as operating leases or capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
in addition  the company records the total rent payable during the lease term on a straight line basis over the term of the lease and records the difference between the rent paid and the straight line rent as a deferred rent liability 
lease incentive payments tenant improvement allowances received from landlords are recorded as deferred rent liabilities and are amortized on a straight line basis over the lease term as a reduction in rent 
future authoritative changes to the methods of accounting for leases could have a material impact on the company s reported results of operations and financial position 
valuation of deferred tax assets we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the carrying value for financial reporting purposes and the tax basis of assets and liabilities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which such differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities  resulting from a change in tax rates  is recognized as a component of income tax expense benefit in the period that such change occurs 
net operating loss and other credit carryforwards  including fica tip tax credits and targeted jobs tax credits  are recorded as deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is recorded for the tax benefit of the deferred tax assets not expected to be utilized based on projected future taxable income 
as of june   we had a net deferred tax asset of million 
as a result of our improved profitability in recent years and our estimates of projected future taxable income  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the majority of these net deferred tax assets 
as of june   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  expiring at various dates through our accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k

this increase was partially offset by a decrease in comparable restaurant sales of 
comparable food sales increased due largely to increases in customer traffic partially offset by a lower guest check average  however  comparable alcohol sales decreased 
the comparable alcohol sales decrease was due  in part  to a strategic de emphasis of the company s late night promotions as the promotions are costly and can alienate dinner guests 
sales in the january through march period were also negatively affected by severe weather primarily in ohio  indiana  the mid atlantic and colorado markets 
furthermore  sales were negatively affected by weakening consumer confidence and the impact of the war in iraq

the decrease was due to higher restaurant expenses as a percent of sales associated with the opening of seven new restaurants in fiscal the income generated from new restaurants is typically lower during the first four months of operation compared to an existing restaurant 
in addition  lower comparable restaurant sales resulted in a higher percentage of fixed expenses during fiscal general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the comparable prior period 
the increase was largely due to a  reversal of bad debt from a franchisee in fiscal  approximately  of litigation settlement costs   of expenses related to terminated projects and higher computer expense due to the new restaurants and increased professional fees in fiscal general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue increased to for fiscal from for the comparable prior period

for fiscal  we recognized an income tax benefit of million compared to income tax expense of million in fiscal the income tax benefit in fiscal was primarily the result of a reversal of the remaining valuation allowance on the company s deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carryforwards 
the reversal of the valuation allowance resulted from a determination by management that the net operating loss carryforwards are not limited under tax law and the company s future taxable income will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the carryforwards before expiration

restaurant level operating profit increased approximately million  or  to million for fiscal compared with million for the comparable prior period 
restaurant level operating profit as a percentage of restaurant sales decreased to for fiscal from for the comparable prior period 
the decrease was due to higher expenses associated with the opening of six new restaurants in fiscal plus three new restaurants in late fiscal the income generated from new restaurants is typically lower during the first four months of operation compared to an existing restaurant 
in addition  lower comparable restaurant sales resulted in a higher percentage of fixed expenses during fiscal general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the comparable prior period 
the increase was largely due to the addition of support personnel 
however  general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue decreased to for fiscal from for the comparable prior period due to the larger revenue base in fiscal pre opening expense 
pre opening expense increased million to million during fiscal from million for the comparable prior period 
we opened six new restaurants in fiscal and opened four new restaurants for the comparable prior period 
in addition  two of the restaurants opened in the last quarter of fiscal  were open only in the last week of that quarter 
although pre opening expense is incurred prior to the opening of a new restaurant  we continue to incur pre opening expense for trainers up to two weeks after a new restaurant opens 
pre opening expense has historically been approximately million per location 
expenses related to predecessor companies and loss from discontinued operations 
expenses related to the daka spin off and fuddruckers sale decreased million to million from million 
the decrease is primarily the result of the length of time since these transactions were completed in and interest expense and income  net

financial condition and liquidity the working capital needs of companies engaged in the restaurant industry are generally low as sales are made for cash  and purchases of food and supplies and other operating expenses are generally paid in to days after receipt of invoices and labor costs are paid bi weekly 
historically  our primary sources of liquidity for funding our operations and expansion have been net cash from operations  and standard restaurant financing methods  such as build to suit transactions  sale leaseback transactions  mortgage facilities  notes payable  tenant improvement allowances and equipment financing 
capital expenditures for the purchase of property and equipment were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
in december  the company received million of gross proceeds from the issuance of convertible subordinated notes notes and warrants 
approximately million of issuance costs were incurred relative to the notes 
the notes are due december and require interest only payments semi annually on june st and december st in arrears 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company utilized a portion of the notes and warrants proceeds for the repayment of million of notes payable before scheduled maturity plus prepayment costs of million 
the company intends to use the remaining proceeds for working capital and to build new restaurants 
between december and february  we entered into two term loans collateralized by equipment with general electric capital business asset funding corporation ge capital 
as of june   we had approximately million outstanding under these term loans 
these loans bear interest at the day commercial paper rate  plus and mature between december and february the ge capital loans require that we maintain certain financial ratios for maximum debt to net worth  a minimum debt coverage  a minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization compared to debt and for maximum funded indebtedness 
we were in compliance with all of these financial ratios as of june  the company has a build to suit facility with aei fund management  inc this agreement provides a commitment for the completion of seven new restaurants with an additional funding commitment of million 
at june   we had completed the construction of two restaurants under this commitment located in houston  texas and in cincinnati  ohio 
the third restaurant to be completed under this commitment is currently being negotiated 
the commitment expires the earlier of november  or upon aei s acceptance or rejection of seven additional restaurant sites 
the funding of this build to suit facility is subject to various pre closing conditions 
in february  the company entered into a bank credit commitment with first national bank of colorado under which it may borrow up to  the commitment has two components  is available to provide short term working capital and to support the issuance of letters of credit  the remaining  is available to provide interim financing associated with construction of new restaurant locations 
advances under the  facility will be in the form of individual promissory notes that require assignment of related tenant improvement allowance proceeds and that will mature days following estimated restaurant opening date 
the commitment expires on january at which time all outstanding borrowings are due 
as of june   the company had not borrowed under these facilities 
in july  the company borrowed  under the construction facility and placed letters of credit in the amount of  pursuant to the short term working capital facility 
the  construction facility loan was repaid in september at june   our unrestricted cash was million and restricted cash was million 
restricted cash includes certificates of deposits to serve as cash collateral for stand by letters of credit and are classified as current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we anticipate that our operations will continue to generate positive operating cash flow for fiscal however  there are also significant cash expenditures anticipated related to the opening of new restaurants and the remodeling and improvements of existing restaurants 
in september  the company executed a proposal for an additional million term loan collateralized with equipment with ge capital 
the company received million of proceeds in fiscal and received the remaining million proceeds in august the loan amortizes on a straight line basis with a final payment due in august these funds are intended to supplement funding for the construction of the six to eight restaurants in fiscal during fiscal  we generated positive cash flow from operating activities of million 
during the year  we received million from the issuance of notes and warrants  million from the ge capital term loans and landlord contribution in the form of landlord tenant improvement allowances totaling million 
during fiscal  we opened seven restaurants 
for fiscal  total capital expenditures for new restaurants were approximately million and million for renovations to existing restaurants and corporate upgrades 
during fiscal  we generated positive cash flow from operating activities of million 
during the same period  we received million associated primarily with the proceeds from the ge capital term loans of million and landlord tenant improvement allowances totaling million 
during fiscal  we opened six restaurants 
for fiscal  total capital expenditures for new restaurants were approximately million and million for renovations to existing restaurants and corporate upgrades 
this amount was partially offset from receipts from equipment capital leases of million 
during fiscal  we generated cash flow from operating activities of million 
during the same period  we received million primarily from the sale leaseback of our las colinas  texas restaurant for million and million from the sale of a former fuddruckers restaurant location 
during fiscal  we opened four restaurants 
total capital expenditures for new restaurants during fiscal were approximately million before the receipt of million from a tenant improvement note payable in fiscal capital expenditures for remodels and improvements to existing restaurants were approximately million in fiscal during fiscal  we anticipate opening six to eight restaurants 
as of september   we had opened two restaurants  begun construction on four restaurants and had signed agreements for four additional restaurants 
we have identified multiple potential sites and are negotiating contracts on additional sites for restaurants to be opened in fiscal and our capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately million for new restaurants and million for remodeling and improvements in existing restaurants and for capital expenditures for our corporate office 
these expenditures will be funded through our unrestricted cash  cash flow from operations  tenant improvement allowances and additional financing 
we anticipate the receipt of tenant improvement allowances to offset capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal we also anticipate that we will make cash payments in fiscal associated with liabilities previously recorded in fiscal and for prior year insurance claims  tax audits and legal settlements related to our indemnification obligations arising from the spin off of daka and the fuddruckers sale transaction 
during fiscal  and  we made payments of million  million and million  respectively  to reduce these liabilities 
anticipated expenditures for these liabilities are estimated to range between million and million for  based upon current estimates 
additionally  the company anticipates paying on going legal costs of between million and million in fiscal related to these liabilities 
currently the company has approximately million accrued for liabilities associated with predecessor companies related to the mccrea judgment and the florida department of revenue s proposed assessment 
although the company believes  and outside legal counsel concurs  that the punitive damages in the mccrea case will not be upheld and the company believes it has meritorious legal and factual defenses regarding the florida department of revenue s proposed assessment  if the mccrea punitive damages are upheld or if the florida department of revenue finalizes their assessment for an amount similar to their proposed assessment and the assessment is ultimately paid  the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows would be impacted 
although the company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to make payments in these matters  the future growth plans of the company may be impacted 
we believe our end of the year cash balance of million plus the proceeds from the million ge financing  the million interim construction financing commitment and anticipated tenant improvement allowances of approximately million  together with our cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to fund our operations  debt repayment and expansion at least through the end of fiscal however  changes in our operating plans  acceleration of our expansion plans  lower than anticipated sales  increased expenses or other events  including those described in item business risk factors  may cause us to seek additional debt or equity financing on an accelerated basis 
financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  and our failure to raise capital when needed could negatively impact our growth plans and our financial condition and results of operations 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our common stock and debt financing  if available  may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants and or financial ratios that restrict our ability to operate our business 
contractual obligations and commitments payments  including interest  due by period as of june  in s contractual obligations total one year and less two to three years four to five years after five years operating leases      capital leases  notes payable      letters of credit construction commitments   build to suit construction commitments we are obligated under non cancelable operating leases for our headquarters and all but one of our restaurants 
the fixed terms of the restaurant leases range up to years and generally contain multiple renewal options for various periods ranging from five to years 
our restaurant leases also contain provisions that require additional payments based on sales performance and the payment of common area maintenance charges and real estate taxes 
amounts in this table do not reflect any of these additional amounts 
impact of inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  alcoholic beverages and labor costs 
a large number of our restaurant associates are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage directly affect our labor costs 
many of our leases require us to pay property taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations in recent years 
we cannot predict whether inflation will have an impact on our results of operations in the future 
recent accounting developments sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  establishes standards for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may and is otherwise effective june  this statement did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation provides guidance on the identification of  and financial reporting for  variable interest entities 
variable interest entities are entities that lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or lack sufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
fin requires a company to consolidate a variable interest entity if that company is obligated to absorb the majority of the entity s expected losses or entitled to receive the majority of the entity s residual returns  or both 
fin also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
fin is applicable immediately to variable interest entities created after january  for all variable interest entities created prior to february   fin is applicable to periods beginning after june  the company currently does not have any variable interest entities that fall under the scope of this interpretation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative market risk disclosures the market risk exposure inherent in the company s financial instruments and consolidated financial position represents the potential losses arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
the company is exposed to such interest rate risk primarily in its significant investment in cash and cash equivalents and the use of fixed and variable rate debt to fund its acquisitions of property and equipment in past years and the implicit interest rates in the company s sale leaseback arrangements 
market risk for cash and cash equivalents and fixed rate borrowings is estimated as the potential change in the fair value of the assets or obligations resulting from a hypothetical ten percent adverse change in interest rates  which would not have been significant to the company s financial position or results of operations during fiscal the effect of a similar hypothetical change in interest rates on the company s variable rate debt and the investment rates implicit in the company s sale leaseback arrangements also would have been insignificant due to the immaterial amounts of borrowings outstanding under the company s credit arrangements
