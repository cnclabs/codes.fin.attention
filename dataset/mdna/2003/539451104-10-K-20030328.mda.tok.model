item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included within item overview lojack develops and markets the lojack system  a unique  patented system designed to assist law enforcement personnel in locating  tracking and recovering stolen vehicles 
beginning in  the company introduced lojack early warning  a new product building on the company s stolen vehicle recovery technology  that provides early notification to a vehicle owner in the event an unauthorized user is operating the vehicle 
in addition  lojack developed and markets a product line of its patented lojack system designated for use in international markets where it may not be practicable or desirable to implement the fully integrated lojack system 
the company s revenues in the united states are derived primarily from the sale of lojack units and related products  alarms  lojack early warning and extended warranties to consumers 
approximately of domestic sales are made through a distribution network consisting of dealers of new and used automobiles 
the company has strong consumer brand awareness in the united states  originally built in the cars and light trucks market  and is continuing to expand its brand awareness to the commercial fleet and construction markets 
the company also derives revenues from license fees  sales of product and royalties pursuant to agreements to license the use of the company s stolen vehicle recovery system technology in over international markets 
revenues from the international segment comprised approximately of consolidated revenues for the year ended december  in connection with this international expansion  the company modified its stolen vehicle recovery technology to have the flexibility of operating independently of existing law enforcement communication networks 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended december   the company introduced lojack early warning in its northeastern markets in the united states  and launched the product in all domestic markets in january revenues from the sale of lojack early warning are recognized over a period of the estimated life of vehicle ownership  generally five years 
while the company showed minimal revenues in as a result of this product  the company expects that this product will contribute more significant revenues in and will result in increased sales of the lojack unit 
on october   the company s board of directors approved a change in the company s fiscal year end from the last day of february to december  effective beginning december  all references to the period ended december  refer to the ten month transition period ended december  critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of lojack and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation 
management is required  in certain instances  to use estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
the actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company s accounting policies are fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein at item a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the significant accounting policies  which the company believes to be the most critical in understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial position and results of operations  include revenue recognition and deferred revenue 
the company earns revenues primarily from the domestic sale and installation of lojack units and lojack early warning  international license fees  sales of products and components to international licensees and from extended and enhanced warranty programs 
the company recognizes revenue on sales of domestic lojack units and most related products upon installation 
revenues relating to the sale of lojack early warning are recognized over a period of the estimated life of vehicle ownership  which third party market research indicates is approximately five years 
if the estimated life of vehicle ownership proves to vary materially from the estimates used by the company  the company would be required to change its estimates  which could result in material differences in the amount of revenue recognized in any given period 
historically  there have not been any changes to management s five year estimate 
management believes the likelihood of material changes to the average estimated life of vehicle ownership is remote 
revenues from international license fees are recognized ratably over the initial term of the license  typically ten years 
revenues from the sales of products and components of the lojack system to international licensees are recognized upon shipment to the licensee or  if later  when payment becomes reasonably assured 
as of december  and  the company deferred revenue recognition of approximately  and  respectively  in product shipments to international licensees 
revenue on these shipments is recognized as payment becomes reasonably assured 
the company warrants to consumers that the lojack unit and related products including the lojack starter disabler  alarm system  shock sensor and lojack early warning will be free from defects in material or workmanship for a period of two years 
the company also warrants to purchasers of lojack units that if their lojack equipped vehicle is stolen in a covered jurisdiction within two years of installation and not recovered within hours from the time that the theft is reported to the police  the company will pay the consumer an amount equal to the full purchase price of the lojack unit up to a maximum of up to if the consumer purchased lojack early warning 
the actual warranty expense is partially contingent upon the percentage of consumer vehicles not recovered 
historically  lojack technology has proven to be successful with a consistently high recovery rate since the product was introduced in if the actual recovery rates were to decline significantly  adverse differences relating to the amount of warranty costs to be accrued could result 
historically  the company s warranty claims have been within the range of management s estimates and recorded warranty reserves 
the company sells several types of contractual extended warranty products 
effective january   for those warranty products to which a third party  and not the company  is the primary obligor  the company recognizes payments for these insurance contracts  net of related costs  in revenues at the time of sale 
revenues related to extended warranties aggregated approximately  for the year ended december  if laws of jurisdictions change so that the company is determined to be the primary obligor  revenues may have to be deferred under such circumstances 
management believes that if these jurisdictional changes occur  reported revenues could be adversely impacted 
for those warranty products for which the company is the primary obligor  revenues are deferred and recognized over the estimated term of the warranties  determined to be equivalent to the estimated life of vehicle ownership  which is five years 
such revenues earned from extended warranties previously deferred aggregated approximately  for the year ended december  if the estimated life of vehicle ownership significantly varies from the estimates used by the company  material differences in the amount of revenue recognized in any given period could result 
incremental costs directly related to the provision of such warranties are deferred and charged to expense proportionately as the revenues are recognized 
any remaining warranty costs relating to actual claims made are recognized when incurred 
accounts receivable 
domestic accounts receivable are due principally from automobile dealers that are geographically dispersed 
if the creditworthiness or the financial strength of the company s customers were to decline  there could be an adverse effect on the company s operating results and cash flows 
the company generally sells products and components of the lojack system to foreign licensees through cash prepayments  letters of credit  purchased export insurance or established payment terms 
should geopolitical situations change in the countries where the company s foreign licensees operate  there could be additional credit risks 
as of december    or of net accounts receivable were due from foreign licensees 
management makes estimates of the collectibility of accounts receivable based upon historic experience  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends 
historically  management s estimates have been consistent with actual losses incurred 
bad debt expense totaled  for the year ended december  research and development 
costs for research and development are expensed as incurred and include salaries  fees to consultants  and other related costs associated with the development of new products 
total research and development expenses totaled   and  for the year ended december   the ten months ended december  and the year ended february   respectively 
a substantial portion of the company s research and development efforts have been outsourced to third parties 
the contracts with third parties require payments based upon completion of defined milestones 
because these milestones and the rate of achievement are unpredictable  the company s recorded research and development expenses may vary significantly from period to period 
such variability can have a significant impact on our operations and cash flows 
expenses related to milestone achievements amounted to   and  for the year ended december   the ten months ended december  and the year ended february   respectively 
future expected attainment of existing milestones could result in expenses of approximately  milestone deliverables are scheduled to be due within the next months 
valuation of cost investments 
the company has made investments in certain foreign licensees  including its french and argentine licensees and  in march  its mexican licensee 
these investments to date have resulted in ownership of or less of any one licensee  resulting in accounting for these investments using the cost method of accounting 
under the cost method of accounting  investments are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other than temporary declines in fair value  distributions of earnings and additional investments made 
the carrying value of these investments are periodically reviewed 
based upon projections of anticipated future cash flows  market conditions  legal factors and operational performance  management has concluded that there are no impairments to the fair value of these investments that should be viewed as other than temporary 
the company has not recorded any gains or losses on these investments through december  while management believes that its estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in operating in these foreign markets could materially affect the company s evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of these investments 
as of december   total investments in the company s foreign licensees  accounted for on the cost basis  amounted to  results of operations in october  the company announced that it had changed its fiscal year end from the end of february to december  effective december  the financial statements reflect the balance sheets as of december  and december  and the related statements of income  stockholders equity and cash flows for the fiscal year ended december   the ten months ended december   and the year ended february  unaudited financial information for the comparable twelve month period ended december  and the ten month period ended december  are presented in the tables below and include any adjustments consisting of normal  recurring adjustments  which are  in the opinion of management  necessary for a fair presentation

cost of goods sold for the year ended december   remained at as compared to the same period a year ago

the company s strategic plan for growth also includes the launch of new products  increasing penetration in existing international markets  as well as the continued re engineering of the lojack unit to take advantage of leading edge rf radio frequency technology 
in certain circumstances  the company has made direct strategic investments in international licensee operations to leverage its close relationships with its partners  to better understand the business models of its licensees  to develop a global technology roadmap and to expand unit sales

in march  the related receivable balance of  was converted to a equity investment 
net cash used for investing activities for the year ended december  decreased to  from  or by  as compared to the ten months ended december  this decrease in cash used is primarily related to lower leasehold improvements made in as compared to  when the company moved its corporate headquarters to its current westwood  massachusetts location

the provisions of eitf issue no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the company does not believe that eitf issue no 
will have a significant impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
amends fasb statement no 
to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of fasb statement no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
have been implemented in notes and to the consolidated financial statements and the interim reporting requirements will be adopted in the first quarter of cautionary statements the private securities litigation reform act of contains certain safe harbors regarding forward looking statements 
from time to time  information provided by the company or statements made by its employees may contain forward looking information  which involves risk and uncertainty 
any statements in this report and accompanying materials that are not statements of historical fact are forward looking statements including  but not limited to  statements concerning the characteristics and growth of the company s market and customers  the company s objectives and plans for future operations and products and the company s expected liquidity and capital resources 
such forward looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and involve a number of risks and uncertainties  and accordingly  actual results could differ materially 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to the company depends on its principal products and market acceptance of them 
the company currently derives most of its revenues from sales of lojack units and related products and the licensing of the lojack system and sale of related products to licensees in foreign countries 
the company also derives a portion of its revenues from sales of conventional vehicle security devices and the sale of warranties 
as a result  any factor adversely affecting sales of the company s principal products would have an adverse effect on the company 
the company s success is also heavily dependent upon acceptance of its current and future products in new markets 
there is no assurance that the lojack system will continue to achieve widespread consumer acceptance in all of the company s existing or future markets 
the company is affected by changes in economic conditions and new vehicle sales 
the company s products are installed principally in new and used vehicles 
while the increase in the sale of its vehicle recovery system was substantially greater than the increase in the sale of new vehicles  any change in general economic conditions resulting in decreased new vehicle sales could adversely affect the company 
because new car sales are most often a discretionary activity  the company is unable to accurately predict its sales in future quarters 
in any quarter  many factors can affect the company s revenues 
these factors include  but are not limited to  periods of economic slowdown  slowdowns in vehicle production  labor disputes affecting the automobile industry and any change in general economic conditions 
if significantly fewer new vehicles are sold  fewer lojack units may be installed 
the company relies on key personnel 
the company s success depends  to a significant degree  upon the efforts and abilities of key technical  marketing  sales and management personnel 
the loss of services of one or more of these key employees could have an adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the company believes that its future success depends in part upon its ability to attract  retain  and motivate qualified personnel necessary for the development of its business 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
the company is subject to government regulations and approval 
the company must obtain the approval of law enforcement agencies  as well other governmental agencies  for implementation of the lojack system before sales of lojack units can commence in a given jurisdiction 
the approval process may be time consuming and costly 
in addition  governmental approval may be terminable by the executive or legislative body in some jurisdictions 
such governmental discretion and regulation may limit the number of potential customers for the company s services or impede its ability to offer competitive services to the market 
the company s licensees will likely encounter similar or additional regulatory requirements as it expands into foreign markets through its licensees 
the company depends on proprietary technology 
the company s success is dependent on its proprietary technology 
although the company seeks to protect its intellectual rights through patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets and license agreements  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to protect its technology from misappropriation or that competitors will not develop similar technology independently 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert that the company s products infringe upon their own patents  copyrights or trade secrets 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be distributed do not protect the company s products and intellectual rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the company currently depends on a single supplier for its principal product 
key components of the company s principal product are currently manufactured to the company s specifications by a single supplier 
although these key components could be obtained from other suppliers  there can be no assurance that the company could obtain such components from an alternative supplier without undue cost and expense 
the company faces competition 
several competitors or potential competitors are marketing or have announced the development of stolen vehicle tracking products  which may be directly competitive with the lojack system 
to the company s knowledge  competitors have not developed stolen vehicle recovery products compatible with the lojack system 
in addition  the company is unaware of any competitor who proposes a system capable of being operated or actively monitored exclusively by law enforcement agencies as is the lojack system 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against existing companies or new entrants to the marketplace 
furthermore  the development by competitors of new or improved products or technologies may render the company s products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has limited exposure to market risk due to the nature of its financial instruments 
the company s financial instruments at december  consisted of cash and equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  deposits  accrued liabilities  and capital lease obligations 
the fair value of these financial instruments as of december   approximated their carrying values 
the company s interest rate exposure is limited primarily to the effect of interest rate changes on amounts outstanding under its  variable rate line of credit facility 
an immediate adverse change in market interest rates would not have had any effect on the company s interest expense for the year ended december   as there were no borrowings outstanding at any time during those periods under its line of credit facility 
in addition  the company does not have any significant foreign currency exposure as most transactions with customers and vendors are denominated in us dollars 
in november  the company entered into an agreement to convert  of its  note receivable from its argentine licensee to be denominated in argentina pesos 
as this note is reserved  there is no foreign currency exposure 
in december  the company established a brazilian subsidiary  however  operations have not begun 
if the company encounters foreign currency exposure by electing to process purchase and sale transactions in brazalian reales  it would manage the related exposure by purchasing forward exchange contracts 
currently  the company does not enter into financial instrument transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
the company does not have any interest in a special purpose entity and does not have any material off balance sheet financing transactions
