item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis contains statements that are forward looking 
these statements are based upon current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors 
see the discussion in forward looking statements on page critical accounting policies the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
management uses its best judgment in the assumptions used to value these estimates  which are based on current facts and circumstances  prior experience and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
the company s accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and are the policies which are most critical in the portrayal of the company s financial position and results of operations long term contracts the company recognizes contract revenue in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the company records revenue on its cost type and time and material contracts based upon direct labor costs and other direct contract costs incurred 
the company has fixed price exit strategy contracts to remediate environmental conditions at contaminated sites under which the company and its customers are protected against cost overruns by insurance policies 
revenue and related costs from these fixed price contracts is recognized using the efforts expended  percentage of completion method of accounting based on total costs incurred to date as compared to total costs estimated at completion 
contract costs include direct labor costs  subcontractor costs  other direct costs and indirect costs 
prior to fiscal  the company used the efforts expended  percentage of completion method based on direct labor costs  but for contracts where subcontractor costs resulted in a more meaningful measure of progress towards completion  they were considered for inclusion in labor costs 
the company s method of revenue recognition requires the company to prepare estimates of costs to complete for contracts in progress 
in making such estimates  judgments are required to evaluate contingencies  such as potential variances in schedule and labor and other contract costs  liability claims  contract disputes or achievement of contractual performance standards 
changes in total estimated contract costs and losses  if any  are recognized in the period they are determined 
allowances for doubtful accounts allowances for doubtful accounts are maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes at june   the company had approximately million of deferred income tax benefits 
the realization of a portion of these benefits is dependent on the company s estimates of future taxable income and its tax planning strategies 
management believes that sufficient taxable income will be earned in the future to realize deferred income tax benefits  accordingly  no valuation allowance has been recorded 
additionally  the realization of these deferred income tax benefits can be impacted by changes to tax codes  statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
business acquisitions assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
at june   the company had approximately million of goodwill  representing the cost of acquisitions in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired companies 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment testing 
the assessment of goodwill involves the estimation of the fair value of the company s reporting unit  as defined by sfas no 
management completed this assessment during the second quarter of fiscal based on the best information available as of the date of assessment and determined that no impairment existed 
there can be no assurance that future events will not result in impairments of goodwill or other assets 
results of operations the company derives its revenue from fees for providing engineering and consulting services 
the types of contracts with our customers and the approximate percentage of net service revenue for the year ended june  from each contract type are as follows time and material fixed price or lump sum cost type with various fee arrangements in the course of providing its services  the company routinely subcontracts drilling  laboratory analyses  construction equipment and other services 
these costs are passed directly through to customers and  in accordance with industry practice  are included in gross revenue 
because subcontractor costs and direct charges can vary significantly from project to project  the company considers net service revenue nsr  which is gross revenue less subcontractor costs and direct charges  as its primary measure of revenue growth 
the following table presents the percentage relationships of items in the consolidated statements of income to nsr years ended june  net service revenue nsr operating costs and expenses cost of services general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization income from operations interest expense income before taxes federal and state income tax provision income before accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change net income dividends and accretion charges on preferred stock net income available to common shareholders compared to the revenue growth trend established in fiscal continued for the sixth consecutive year 
gross revenue increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal nsr increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal the fiscal nsr growth was entirely attributable to acquisitions 
approximately of nsr growth for fiscal was from acquisitions while organic existing business nsr decreased by compared to last year 
management s goal continues to be to provide a reasonable balance between organic and acquisition growth over a several year period 
income from operations decreased by million to million in fiscal compared to million last year 
acquisitions provided approximately million of operating income growth  while operating income from organic activities decreased by approximately million compared to last year 
management s objective is to maintain a reasonable balance over time between increases in income from operations derived from organic and acquisition growth 
for example  for fiscal years through  income from operations increases from organic and acquisition growth were and  respectively 
the inability to achieve this balance this year as well as the increase in cost of services as a percentage of nsr was due to a reduction in the utilization of the company s staff related to three primary factors as follows challenging economic conditions which affected several of the company s operating centers 
until this fiscal year  these types of market changes were mitigated by increases in higher margin business 
the area most affected was the transportation infrastructure market where the company relies on funding from state and local government entities  the delay in new contract awards for exit strategy and other higher margin programs attributable to economic conditions  general customer uncertainty regarding capital investments and unusual winter conditions  and costs associated with substantial hiring and project investments the company made in key markets which are expected to grow in spite of current economic conditions 
examples include the planning  design and installation of electric power transmission and distribution systems and the installation of distributed generation power systems  assisting customers in the planning and design of infrastructure security systems  assisting customers in evaluating financial aspects of acquiring or divesting energy related assets  and expansion into the niche market of manufactured gas plant site remediation 
management has implemented actions to reduce costs  increase operational efficiencies and align capacity with the current pace of activity 
as these actions yield results  and recent investments increasingly yield positive gains  management expects that a closer balance between organic and acquisition growth will again be realized 
general and administrative expenses g a increased approximately in fiscal primarily due to additional costs necessary to support the company s growth resulting from acquisitions as well as increased costs for audit and legal services 
however  as a percentage of nsr  g a expenses only increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this demonstrates the company s ability to generate and manage the increased revenue without adding a proportional amount of overhead  resulting in higher margins for all services performed 
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the additional depreciation expense of capital expenditures made throughout the year  the amortization expense related to identifiable intangibles from acquisitions  as well as the additional depreciation expense associated with acquisitions completed in fiscal and interest expense increased by approximately in fiscal compared to last year primarily due to higher average borrowings outstanding against the company s revolving credit facility to finance acquisitions 
the company s percentage of debt to capitalization ratio of continues to remain relatively low  reflecting management s conservative debt philosophy 
the provision for federal and state income taxes reflects an effective rate of in fiscal compared to in fiscal this small increase was primarily due to higher state income taxes 
the company believes that there will be sufficient taxable income in future periods to enable utilization of available deferred income tax benefits 
the company changed its method of accounting for fixed price contracts  effective july  the cumulative effect of the change decreased net income by  net of income taxes of  or per diluted share  which was retroactively reflected in the first quarter of fiscal before the cumulative effect adjustment  this accounting change had the effect of increasing revenue  net income and diluted earnings per share in fiscal by   and  respectively 
compared to gross revenue increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal nsr increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal these increases were due to a combination of internal growth arising out of increased demand for the company s services and the additional revenue from acquisitions made in fiscal and as discussed above  nsr from acquired companies is considered part of acquisition growth during the twelve months following the date acquired 
approximately of the nsr growth for fiscal was from acquisitions  while  as discussed below  operating income growth for fiscal was greater from organic activities 
these characteristics were due to the relatively larger size of the two recently acquired companies  compared to the company s historically smaller size acquisitions 
the seasonality of the largest acquisition site blauvelt  which added significant nsr with relatively small operating income during the winter period 
increased margins provided by the company s organic business activities 
cost of services increased in fiscal compared to due to the increase in nsr 
general and administrative expenses g a increased approximately in fiscal primarily from additional costs necessary to support the company s internal and acquisition growth 
however  as a percentage of nsr  g a expenses decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease was due to the company s ability to generate and manage the increased revenue without adding a proportional amount of overhead  resulting in higher margins for all services performed 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the company s early adoption of sfas no 
on july  in accordance with sfas no 
 the company no longer amortizes goodwill 
the decrease associated with the adoption of sfas no 
was  however  partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense primarily associated with acquisitions completed in fiscal and income from operations increased approximately to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal additionally  the company s operating income margin increased to from during the same period 
approximately of the fiscal operating income growth increase was from organic activities 
the remaining of operating income growth was from acquisitions completed during fiscal the favorable organic growth percentage reflects the company s successful efforts to obtain higher margin revenue for its services 
the improvement in operating income performance was primarily due to the company s focus toward higher margin  economically driven markets  the growth in revenue  without comparable increases in overhead  and the favorable impact resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
interest expense decreased by approximately in fiscal primarily due to lower average interest rates throughout the year 
the company s percentage of debt to capitalization ratio was 
the provision for federal and state income taxes reflected an effective rate of in fiscal compared to an effective rate of in fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in the federal income tax rate bracket as a result of the company s income growth 
the company believes that there will be sufficient taxable income in future periods to enable utilization of available deferred income tax benefits 
impact of inflation the company s operations have not been materially affected by inflation or changing prices because of the short term nature of many of its contracts and the fact that most contracts of a longer term are subject to adjustment or have been priced to cover anticipated increases in labor and other costs 
liquidity and capital resources the company primarily relies on cash from operations and financing activities  including borrowings based upon the strength of its balance sheet  to fund operations 
the company s liquidity is assessed in terms of its overall ability to generate cash to fund its operating and investing activities and to reduce debt 
of particular importance in the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities  acquisitions  capital expenditure levels and an adequate bank line of credit 
cash flows from operating activities increased to approximately million in fiscal  compared to million last year 
in fiscal  the cash provided by operating activities was primarily generated by net income and the non cash charges against income for the cumulative effect of the accounting change and charges for depreciation and amortization 
as shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows  additional cash flow related factors included changes in account receivable  long term insurance receivable  billings in advance of revenue earned  income taxes payable  and several lesser items 
as a result of the above factors  some periods have a high operating cash flow to net income relationship while in others  the relationship is much lower 
over longer time periods  the effect tends to be normalized with an overall positive operating cash flow trend 
this is illustrated by the variation in operating cash flow for fiscal years  and cash flow from accounts receivable before the effect of acquisitions increased by million  compared to a decrease of million in fiscal accounts receivable include both billed receivables associated with invoices submitted for work previously completed and unbilled receivables work in progress 
the unbilled receivables are primarily related to work performed in the last month of the fiscal year 
the magnitude of the accounts receivable for a professional services company is typically evaluated as days sales outstanding dso  which is calculated by dividing both current and long term receivables by the most recent six month average of daily gross revenue 
during fiscal  the company s dso averaged days 
management s long term goal is to reduce dso to days 
billings in advance of revenue earned represents amounts collected in accordance with contractual terms before the work is performed  primarily on exit strategy contracts 
these payments provide the company with an advance source of cash for one to several years 
during years when the amount of payments from exit strategy contracts exceeds the amount of revenue recognized as work is performed on the contracts  billings in advance of revenue earned will increase and thereby provide operating cash flow 
for instance  during fiscal  the increase in billings in advance of revenue earned contributed million towards the total cash provided by operating activities 
during years when the amount of revenue recognized from work performed exceeds the amount of payments from exit strategy contracts  billings in advance of revenue earned will decrease and reduce operating cash flow 
during fiscal  the decrease in billings in advance of revenue earned reduced operating cash flow by million from the prior year 
during fiscal  the decrease in operating cash flow from billings in advance of revenue earned was million from the prior year 
for fiscal  operating cash flows increased by non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million 
other non cash items include insurance recoverable and environmental remediation liability 
the net non cash impact of these two related items for fiscal was million 
these items relate to certain exit strategy contracts where the company enters into a consent decree with government authorities assuming the obligation for the settling responsible parties environmental remediation liability for the site  which is offset by a fully funded remediation finite cost cap insurance policy  generally provided by american international group aig 
each insurance policy provides protection against potential increases in the cost of a project 
upon signing of each contract  with a finite cost cap insurance policy  a majority of the contract price is directly deposited in a restricted account held by aig 
aig then pays the company from the deposited funds as work is performed 
the long term insurance receivable is associated with amounts held by aig for work performed  but which are currently not yet payable under the terms of the policy 
these amounts will be paid as the company completes work on the project 
the effect on periodic operating cash flows will vary depending upon the mix of work performed  but not yet payable and amounts reimbursed to the company by aig 
for fiscal  the long term insurance receivable item resulted in a cash flow decrease of million 
finally  operating cash flows for fiscal decreased by million for income taxes payable primarily related to the fiscal liability and by million for accrued compensation and benefits primarily related to the timing of payroll cycles 
cash flows used in investing activities have historically consisted of payments for acquisitions  capital expenditures for additional information technology and other equipment to support business growth and investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
during fiscal  the company s cash flows used in investing activities of approximately million primarily consisted of approximately million for new acquisitions and additional purchase price payments on acquisitions completed in prior years  and approximately million for capital expenditures 
during fiscal  the company s financing activities provided cash of million to primarily support investing activities 
this cash was primarily provided by net borrowings from the company s credit facility 
the company maintains a banking arrangement with wachovia bank  na  in syndication with two additional banks  which provides a revolving credit facility of up to million to support short term operating and investing activities 
borrowings under the agreement bear interest at wachovia s base rate or the eurodollar rate plus or minus applicable margins and are due and payable in march when the agreement expires 
borrowings under the agreement are collateralized by accounts receivable 
at june  outstanding borrowings pursuant to the agreement were million  at an average interest rate of 
the credit facility provides for affirmative and negative covenants that restrict  among other things  the company s ability to incur other indebtedness  dispose of assets  pay dividends on its common stock and make investments 
in addition  the agreement includes certain restrictive covenants  including the minimum ratio of adjusted ebitda to interest expense plus the current portion of long term debt and the minimum ratio of adjusted current assets to adjusted total liabilities 
the company was in compliance with all relevant covenants as of june  the agreement was amended on june  to reduce the required minimum ratio of adjusted ebitda to interest expense plus the current portion of long term debt at june  and for each quarterly period thereafter through march  the amendment also reduces the required minimum ratio by which adjusted current assets shall exceed adjusted total liabilities for the remainder of the agreement 
the company expects that it will meet all applicable quarterly financial tests contained in the amended agreement in fiscal we expect that the cash generated from operations  the cash on hand at june  and available borrowings under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements for currently anticipated activities 
if the company pursues acquisitions or investments in the future in which the potential cash consideration approaches or exceeds the availability of current sources  the company would either increase its lending facility or pursue additional financing 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth as of june  certain information concerning the company s obligations to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements dollars in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt   subordinated notes    operating leases      capitalized lease obligations total contractual obligations     off balance sheet arrangements the company has operating leases for most of its office facilities and certain equipment 
rental expenses for operating leases was approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal minimum operating lease obligations payable in future years are presented above in contractual obligations
