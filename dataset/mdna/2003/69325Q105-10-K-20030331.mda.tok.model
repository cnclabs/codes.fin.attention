overview and recent developments we provide cost effective software based communications solutions that address high speed internet connectivity requirements for existing and emerging technologies 
our communications products enable internet access through pcs and alternative internet access devices 
our soft modem products consist of a hardware chipset containing a proprietary host signal processing software architecture which allows for the utilization of the computational and processing resources of a host central processor  effectively replacing special purpose hardware required in conventional hardware based modems 
together  the combination of the chipset and software drivers are a component part within a computer which allows for telecommunications connectivity 
by replacing hardware with a software solution  our host signal processing technology lowers costs while enhancing capabilities 
our strategy is to broaden product offerings that enable cost effective access in both wired and wireless environments 
in may  we acquired the assets of cyberpixie  inc cyberpixie  a wireless access provider 
the acquisition of cyberpixie is consistent with our strategy and permits us to participate in a new emerging market 
as a result of the acquisition  we obtained products and technology that will enable roaming between and among wireless and cellular networks 
our wireless product portfolio consists of both pc client and network infrastructure products branded as our segue tm product line 
our wireless client product is a pc based software solution that facilitates roaming and connection to wireless networks 
these networks may be public wireless local area network wlan hot spots  and cellular data networks wireless wide area networks  as well as private enterprise and home wlans 
our client products are offered as custom branded offerings associated with a particular carrier and typically includes carrier specific service finder location databases 
our client product offers a superior end user experience while simultaneously reducing the costs associated with typical end user support problems that our product addresses 
our infrastructure products consist of software programs and third party computing platforms embedded or pc servers that enable the deployment of public wlans 
our gateway product aggregates wlan traffic from multiple access points  supports proprietary end user features  provides location specific content  and supports industry standard radius compliant end user authentication and accounting 
our wlan controller further aggregates gateway traffic and provides storage for end user databases  subscription plans  and central control of gateway management functions 
we sell soft modems to manufacturers and distributors principally in asia through our sales personnel  independent sales representatives and distributors 
our sales to manufacturers and distributors in asia were  and of our total sales for the years ended   and  respectively 
the predominance of our sales is in asia because our customers are primarily motherboard and modem manufacturers  and the majority of these manufacturers are located in asia 
in many cases  our indirect original equipment manufacturer customers specify that our products be included on the modem boards or motherboards that they purchase from the board manufacturers  and we sell our products directly to the board manufacturers for resale to our indirect original equipment manufacturer customers  both in the united states and internationally 
the economic downturn that began in and has continued throughout and has adversely affected our business and operating results 
in particular  since the fourth quarter of  our customers  primarily our pc motherboard and distribution manufacturers  have been adversely impacted by significantly lower pc demand which has  in turn  lowered demand for our products 
as a result  our revenues decreased from million in to million in and million in partly as a consequence of the economic slowdown  during  we reduced our headcount from personnel at the end of to at the end of we further reduced our headcount in by an additional persons 
our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers and the loss of one or more of these customers could cause our revenues to decrease 
continuing decreases in the average selling prices of our products will result in decreased revenue as well 
as of december   we have million in cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  at december   we have million in short term investments  that potentially subject us to credit and market risks 
to mitigate credit risk related to short term investments  we have an investment policy to preserve the value of capital and generate interest income from these investments without undue exposure to risk fluctuations by investing in highly rated  short term investments 
market risk is the potential loss due to the change in value of a financial instrument due to interest rates or equity prices 
our investment policy is to stipulate short durations  limiting interest rate exposure 
we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations with ratings of a or better and money market funds 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period reported 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  market trends  and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues consist primarily of sales of products to original equipment manufacturers oems and distributors 
revenues from sales to customers are recognized upon shipment when title and risk of loss passes to the customers  when the price is fixed or determinable and when there is evidence of an arrangement  unless we have future obligations or have to obtain customer acceptance  in which case revenue is deferred until such obligations have been satisfied or customer acceptance has been achieved 
we provide for estimated sales returns and customer rebates related to sales to oems at the time of shipment 
customer rebates are recorded against revenues 
as of december  and  we have an allowance for customer rebates recorded against accounts receivable of  and  respectively  and accrued customer rebates of million and million  respectively  presented as current accrued liabilities on the balance sheet 
accrued customer rebates will be paid to the customers  upon request  in the future unless they are forfeited by the customer 
revenues from sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing price protection and rights of return on unsold products 
we record revenue relating to sales to distributors only when the distributors have sold the product to end users 
customer payment terms generally range from letters of credit collectible upon shipment to open accounts payable days after shipment 
royalty revenue is recognized when confirmation of royalties due to us is received from licensees or for non refundable minimal royalty agreements  over the period that the company provides support to the customer and where we offer extended payment terms  as payments are received 
furthermore  revenues from technology licenses are recognized after delivery has occurred  the amount is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
to the extent there are extended payment terms on these contracts  revenue is recognized as the payments become due and the cancellation privilege lapses 
to date  we have not offered post contract customer support 
in instances where the company provides non recurring engineering services to customers  the company recognizes revenue as the services are completed  using the percentage of completion basis of accounting in accordance with statement of position  accounting for performance and construction type contracts 
inventory write downs and recoveries inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include material  labor and overhead costs 
inventories as of december  and were composed of finished goods and work in process only 
we regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand 
based on our current estimated requirements  it was determined that there was excess inventory and those excess amounts were fully reserved as of december  and due to competitive pressures and technological innovation  it is possible that these estimates could increase in the near term 
due to the changing market conditions  the recent economic downturn and technological innovations  inventory write downs of million were recorded in the second half of given the volatility of the market  the age of the inventories on hand and the expected introduction of new products in  we wrote down excess inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand and firm purchase order commitments from our major suppliers 
actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such difference may have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
for the year ended december   we did not record any additional inventory write downs 
we sold part of the written down inventories and recovered million of the former write downs for the year ended december  as of december   the cumulative write down for excess inventory on hand was million 
our products may attract static electricity charges over time and have a limited shelf life 
accordingly  in addition to the write down of excess inventory  we also provide a reserve against obsolete inventory 
as of december   the cumulative write down for obsolete inventory on hand was million 
in  we scrapped the entire balance of these obsolete inventories 
accrued royalties we record an accrual for estimated future royalty payments for relevant technology of others used in our product offerings in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the estimated royalties accrual reflects management s broader litigation and cost containment strategies  which may include alternatives such as entering into cross licensing agreements  cash settlements and or ongoing royalties based upon our judgment that such negotiated settlements would allow management to focus more time and financial resources on the ongoing business 
accordingly  the royalties accrual reflects estimated costs of settling claims rather than continuing to defend our legal positions and is not intended to be  nor should it be interpreted as  an admission of infringement of intellectual property  valuation of damages suffered by any third parties or any specific terms that management has predetermined to agree to in the event of a settlement offer 
we have accrued our best estimate of the amount of royalties payable for royalty agreements already signed  agreements that are in negotiation and unasserted but probable claims of others using advice from third party technology advisors and historical settlement rates 
should a review of our estimated royalty result in a conclusion that a lower accrual is necessary  then there would be a positive effect on earnings 
as of december  and  we had accrued royalties of approximately million and million  respectively 
however  the amounts accrued may be inadequate and we may be required to take additional charges if royalty payments are settled at a higher rate than expected  based on our experience of royalty rates normally charged by licensors in our industry 
in addition  settlement arrangements may require royalties for both past and future sales of the associated products 
if this is the case our gross margins will decrease on these future product sales 
on march   townshend entered into a settlement agreement with us  which settled the federal court action and state court action 
the settlement agreement required us to make a cash royalty payment on march   of million related to past liability and prepayment of future royalties due to reserves which had been established in prior periods in anticipation of settlement 
as of december   we have classified the prepayment as other assets  of which million represents the current portion and million represents the long term portion 
income taxes we provide for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires an asset and liability based approach in accounting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates 
valuation allowances are provided against assets which are not likely to be realized 
we currently have subsidiaries in japan  france  taiwan and yugoslavia as well as branch offices in taiwan and korea 
the complexities brought on by operating in several different tax jurisdictions inevitably lead to an increased exposure to worldwide taxes 
should review of our tax fillings and such reviews result in unfavorable adjustments to our tax returns  our operating results and financial position could be materially and adversely affected 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes  which involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
we maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
results of operations years ended december   and all amounts in tables  other than percentages  are in thousands revenues revenues product    revenues royalty and licensing    total revenues    change from prior period product change from prior period royalty and licensing total change from prior period our revenues primarily consist of product sales of soft modems to board manufacturers and distributors in asia 
product revenues increased million for the year ended december  from the revenue increase was primarily due to stronger modem sales  in particular  one of our major customers significantly increased purchases in the second half of the year 
software and licensing revenues amounted to million for the year ended december   compared with million for licensing revenue includes million from the settlement of the ess litigation as well as million from another large customer 
revenues decreased million for the year ended december  from the revenue decrease was primarily attributable to less unit shipments as a result of an abnormally poor pc market caused by poor economic conditions 
additionally  the decrease in sales revenues was due to a decrease in average selling prices 
software and licensing revenues amounted to million for the year ended december   compared with million for gross profit gross profit product   gross profit royalty and licensing    total gross profit    percentage of revenues change from prior period  cost of revenues consists primarily of chipsets we purchase from third party manufacturers and also includes accrued intellectual property royalties  cost of operations and distribution costs 
provision for inventory losses are also included in the determination of gross profit 
product gross profit increased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the provision for inventory losses of million recorded in  an inventory recovery of million recognized in the year ended december  and the elimination of goodwill amortization of million resulting from write off of goodwill arising from the acquisition of the communications systems division csd 
these improvements in gross profit were partially offset by decreasing average selling prices commonly seen in the industry 
gross profit as a percentage of product revenues increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  for the same reasons 
gross profit from licensing and royalty revenue increased million for the year ended december  from due to increased royalty and licensing revenue in compared with as a percentage of revenues  we expect gross profit to decrease in the next year as a result of the decreasing average selling prices commonly seen in the industry 
in addition  the fixed portion of our costs as a percentage of revenue decreased as a result of the benefit of restructuring activities commenced in and the increase in revenues 
gross profit decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in primarily due to decreased sales revenues and the provision for inventory losses of million recorded in gross profit as a percentage of product revenue decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  because of the provision for inventory losses and because average selling prices decreased faster than the rate of cost reduction 
in addition  the fixed portion of our costs as a percentage of revenue increased due to the decrease in revenues 
research and development research and development    percentage of revenues change from prior period research and development expenses include costs for software and hardware development  prototyping  certification and pre production costs 
we expense all research and development costs as incurred 
for the year ended december   total research and development costs incurred were million  compared to and million for and  respectively 
research and development expenses decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to primarily because of decreased personnel expenses resulting from the reductions in force that occurred throughout fiscal year and the savings from the closure of the connecticut engineering center in june this decrease in research in development expenses was offset by our expansion of research and development efforts in wireless products and utilities 
in  we closed down our connecticut engineering center which focused on embedded products and shifted our research and development efforts to wireless products and utilities 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development costs decreased for the year ended december  for the same reasons as above as well as due to our higher revenues in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  we expect research and development costs to remain the same in as we continue to invest in the development of wireless products and utilities 
research and development expenses decreased million for the year ended december   compared to as a result of the completion of certain projects and the reduction in headcount gradually through the year 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development increased for the year ended december  because of lower revenues in research and development headcount decreased from to from december  to december  and sales and marketing sales and marketing    percentage of revenues change from prior period sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  sales commissions and marketing costs 
sales commissions payable to our distributors are recognized as expenses when our products are sold through from the distributors to end users so that the commission expense is matched with related recognition of revenues 
marketing costs include promotional costs  publication graphics costs  public relations and trade shows 
sales and marketing expenses decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the decrease in spending is primarily due to decreased personnel expenses as a result of the reductions in force that occurred in fiscal year and the second quarter of as a percentage of revenues  we expect sales and marketing costs to remain the same in sales and marketing expenses decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the decrease in spending reflects the reduction of sales and marketing personnel as a result of lower revenues and the reduction in force in sales and marketing headcount decreased from to from december  to december  and to at december  general and administrative general and administrative    percentage of revenues change from prior period general and administrative expenses include costs associated with our general management and finance functions as well as professional service charges  such as legal  tax and accounting fees 
other general expenses include rent  insurance  utilities  travel and other operating expenses to the extent not otherwise allocated to other functions 
general and administrative expenses decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the decrease was primarily due to decreased legal costs associated with the patent infringement litigation against smart link  ess technology and dr 
brent townshend which were settled in may  february and march  respectively  offset by an increase in headcount from in to in as a percentage of revenues  we expect general and administrative costs to remain relatively the same in however  should any new litigation arise in  our legal costs and general and administrative expenses could significantly increase 
general and administrative expenses increased million for the year ended december  compared to the increase was primarily due to the increased legal costs associated with the patent infringement litigation against smart link  ess and townshend and offset by the reduction in headcount to from acquired in process research and development acquired in process research and development  percentage of revenues upon completion of the voyager acquisition on february   we immediately expensed million representing purchased in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the million expensed as in process research and development was approximately of the purchase price

amortization of goodwill and intangible assets amortization of goodwill and intangible assets   percentage of revenues amortization of goodwill and intangible assets decreased from million for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  in prior years  we purchased assets or businesses that resulted in the creation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
in the second half of  pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  we evaluated the recoverability of our long lived assets  including intangibles acquired from csd  voyager and bluecom  and recorded impairment charges totaling million 
as a result of the impairment charges  the carrying value of the related goodwill was reduced to approximately million 
additionally  effective january   we have adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  under which goodwill is no longer being amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually 
in may  we acquired the assets of cyberpixie for a total of million in cash 
the company followed the guidance of sfas for this acquisition 
the purchase price of million was allocated to the tangible and identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition as determined by an independent valuation firm 
we attributed million to in process research and development and million to developed technology 
we expensed in process research and development and amortize the developed technology 
the million excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets was allocated to goodwill 
on december   we completed the acquisition of bluecom 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the difference of million by which the purchase price exceeded tangible and identifiable intangible assets was allocated to goodwill 
on february   we completed the acquisition of voyager 
the acquisition was structured as a tax free reorganization and was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
we attributed million of the purchase price to in process research and development  which we expensed immediately  million to intellectual property and million to workforce  both of which are being amortized 
the difference by which the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was million and was allocated goodwill 
goodwill was being amortized in and  prior to our adoption of sfas impairment of goodwill and intangible assets impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  percentage of revenues in the second half of  pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  we evaluated the recoverability of the long lived assets  including intangibles acquired from csd  voyager and bluecom  and recorded impairment charges totaling million 
due to the economic downturn  we determined that csd s estimated future undiscounted cash flows were below the carrying value of csd s long lived assets 
accordingly  during the third quarter of  we adjusted the carrying value of csd s long lived assets  primarily goodwill  to their estimated fair value of approximately million  resulting in an impairment charge of approximately million 
the estimated fair value was based on anticipated future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
we determined the goodwill and intangible assets acquired from voyager  as a result of the recent corporate restructuring and reorganization  that there are no future cash flows expected from this business 
accordingly  during the third quarter of  we wrote off the carrying value of voyager s long lived assets  primarily goodwill  resulting in an impairment charge of approximately million 
in regards to the goodwill and intangible assets acquired from bluecom  as a result of the corporate restructuring and reorganization  we determined that there are no future cash flows expected from this business 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of  we wrote off the carrying value of bluecom s long lived assets  resulting in an impairment charge of approximately million 
restructuring charges restructuring charges  percentage of revenues during  we announced a series of actions to streamline support for our voiceband business and sharpen our focus on emerging growth sectors 
these measures were part of two restructuring program and included a reduction in worldwide headcount of employees 
the restructuring resulted in million of charges for the year ended december   consisting of severance and employment related costs of million and costs related to closure of excess facilities of million 
in june  we further reduced worldwide headcount by employees consisting of research and development employees  sales and marketing employees and general and administrative employees 
in september  we announced our intention to move our corporate headquarters to chicago  illinois 
as a result of the move  general and administrative employees were replaced  resulting in additional severance and employment related costs 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of  we further reduced our headcount by research and development employees 
the relocation and restructuring resulted in additional charges of  consisting of severance  employment related costs and costs related to closure of excess facilities

there was no grant of restricted stock to employees in such amounts are presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and are amortized ratably over the vesting period of the applicable shares 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees prior to our initial public offering in  we recorded deferred stock compensation of million representing the difference between the exercise price and deemed fair value of our common stock on the date these stock options were granted 
such amount is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and is amortized ratably over the vesting period of the applicable options 
the amortization of deferred stock compensation decreased  for the year ended december  compared to primarily due to the termination of employees in  offset by additional expenses related to the restricted stock grants in and we expect the amortization of deferred stock compensation to be approximately  per quarter through and decreasing thereafter  based on restricted stock grants and stock option grants through december  the amount of deferred stock compensation expense to be recorded in future periods could decrease if options for which accrued but unvested compensation has been recorded are forfeited 
if we grant additional restricted stock  the amortization of deferred compensation will increase 
the amortization of deferred stock compensation decreased  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended primarily due to the termination of employees in and the corresponding reversal of the remaining deferred stock compensation balance 
this decrease was offset by the additional expense related to the restricted stock grants in in and in future years  amortization of deferred stock compensation that will be recorded assuming no terminations would be as follows amortization of deferred stock compensation december  amortization of deferred stock compensation  other income  net other income  net    percentage of revenues other income  net  consists of interest income  net of interest expense of  in interest income is expected to fluctuate over time

during the third quarter of  we recorded million of provision for income taxes to establish valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of fasb no 
 accounting for income taxes as a result of uncertainties regarding realizability 
our effective tax rate was below the statutory tax rate of during primarily due to the recognition of benefits relating to various tax deductible accruals  reserves and net operating losses previously unrecognized as well as tax credit for research and development activities in the amounts of  k and k  respectively

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity  consisting of cash  short term investments and cash from operations  will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
we will continue to evaluate opportunities for development of new products and potential acquisitions of technologies or businesses that could complement our business 
we may use available cash or other sources of funding for such purposes 
however  possible investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies  or cash settlements resulting from new litigation  may require us to use our existing working capital or to seek additional financing 
in addition  if the current economic downturn prolongs  we will need to continue to expend our cash reserves to fund our operations

price erosion experienced by any company can cause revenues and gross margins to decline 
we believe that the average selling price of our products is likely to continue to decline in the future due principally to competitive pressure 
this pricing pressure will likely reduce our gross margins  adversely affect our operating results and may result in the decrease in the price of our stock 
in addition  we believe that the widespread adoption of industry standards in the soft modem industry is likely to further erode average selling prices  particularly for analog modems 
adoption of industry standards is driven by the market requirement to have interoperable modems 
end users need this interoperability to ensure modems from different manufacturers communicate with each other without problems 
historically  users have deferred purchasing modems until these industry standards are adopted 
however  once these standards are accepted  it lowers the barriers to entry and price erosion results 
decreasing average selling prices in our products could result in decreased revenues even if the number of units that we sell increases 
therefore  we must continue to develop and introduce next generation products with enhanced functionalities that can be sold at higher gross margins 
our failure to do this could cause our revenues and gross margins to decline 
our future success depends on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new and enhanced products  particularly  wireless products and technology  that meet the needs of our customers and achieve broad market acceptance 
our revenue depends on our ability to anticipate our customers needs and develop products that address those needs 
in particular  our future success will depend on our ability to introduce new products for the wireless market  anticipate improvements and enhancements in wireless technology and in wlan standards  and to develop products that are competitive in the rapidly changing wireless market 
introduction of new products and product enhancements will require coordination of our efforts with those of our suppliers and manufacturers to rapidly achieve volume production 
if we fail to coordinate these efforts  develop product enhancements or introduce new products that meet the needs of our customers as scheduled  our revenues may be reduced and our business may be harmed 
we may not be successful in timely introducing new wireless products as a result of our relative inexperience in developing  marketing  selling and supporting these products 
we cannot assure you that product introductions will meet the anticipated release schedules or that our wireless products will be competitive in the market 
furthermore  given the emerging nature of the wireless market  there can be no assurance our products and technology will not be rendered obsolete by alternative or competing technologies 
if we are unable to successfully compete in a particular market with internally developed products  we may have to license technology from other businesses or acquire other businesses as an alternative to internal research and development 
our business and our ability to grow revenues have been adversely impacted by the economic slowdown and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate 
since the fourth quarter of  our customers  primarily our pc motherboard and distribution manufacturers  have been impacted by significantly lower pc demand 
as a result  our revenues and earnings in fiscal year and were negatively affected 
because we expect pc demand to continue to be weak for the foreseeable term  we expect our revenues and earnings to remain at the same level in as a result of the adverse economic environment 
adverse economic conditions worldwide have contributed to a technology industry slowdown  particularly a rapid deterioration in the demand for pcs  and have impacted our business  resulting in reduced demand for most of our products  increased price competition for our products  increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories  excess facilities and manufacturing capacity  and higher overhead costs  as a percentage of revenues 
recent political and social turmoil in many parts of the world  including actual incidents and potential future acts of terrorism and the current war in iraq  may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions 
these political  social and economic conditions and uncertainties make it extremely difficult for pctel and for our customers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and for us to forecast customer demand for our products 
we must forecast and place purchase orders for specialized semiconductor chips several months before we receive purchase orders for our products from our own customers 
this forecasting and order lead time requirement limits our ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products 
these fluctuations can be unexpected and may cause us to have excess inventory or a shortage of a particular product 
this reduced predictability challenges our ability to operate profitably and to increase revenues 
in particular  it is difficult to develop and implement strategies  sustainable business models and efficient operations  and it is difficult for us to effectively manage outsourced relationships 
if the current economic or market conditions continue or further deteriorate  there could be additional material adverse impact on our financial position  revenues  results of operations and cash flow 
during the second half of  due to the changing market conditions  recent economic downturn and technological innovation  a provision for inventory losses of million was charged against operations 
given the volatility of the market  the age of the inventories on hand and the expected introduction of new products later in  we wrote down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand and firm purchase order commitments from our major suppliers in actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such difference may have a material effect on our financial position and result of operations 
for the year ended december   we did not record any additional inventory write downs 
we sold part of the written down inventories and recovered million of the former write downs for the year ended december  as of december   the cumulative write down for excess inventory on hand was million 
our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers and the loss of one or more of these customers could cause our revenues to decrease 
our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers 
if we were to lose one or more of these customers  or if one or more of these customers were to delay or reduce purchases of our products  our sales revenues may decrease 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenues were generated by four of our customers  representing   and of revenues  respectively 
all of these customers may in the future decide not to purchase our products at all  purchase fewer products than they did in the past or alter their purchasing patterns  because  among other reasons we do not currently have any long term purchase arrangements or contracts with these or any of our other customers  our product sales to date have been made primarily on a purchase order basis  which permits our customers to cancel  change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice and without penalty  and many of our customers also have pre existing relationships with current or potential competitors which may affect our customers purchasing decisions 
we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues for at least the next to months and that a significant portion of our sales will continue to be made on the basis of purchase orders 
we have significant sales concentrated in asia 
continued political and economic instability in asia and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable may make it difficult for us to maintain or increase market demand for our products 
our sales to customers located in asia accounted for of our total revenues for the year ended december  the predominance of our sales is in asia  mostly in taiwan and china  because our customers are primarily motherboard or modem manufacturers that are located there 
in many cases  our indirect original equipment manufacturer customers specify that our products be included on the modem boards or motherboards  the main printed circuit board containing the central processing unit of a computer system  that they purchase from board manufacturers  and we sell our products directly to the board manufacturers for resale to our indirect original equipment manufacturer customers  both in the united states and internationally 
due to the industry wide concentration of modem manufacturers in asia  we believe that a high percentage of our future sales will continue to be concentrated with asian customers 
as a result  our future operating results could be uniquely affected by a variety of factors outside of our control  including delays in collecting accounts receivable  which we have experienced from time to time  fluctuations in the value of asian currencies relative to the us dollar  which may make it more costly for us to do business in asia and which may in turn make it difficult for us to maintain or increase our revenues  changes in tariffs  quotas  import restrictions and other trade barriers which may make our products more expensive compared to our competitors products  and political and economic instability 
failure to manage our technological and product growth could strain our management  financial and administrative resources 
our ability to successfully sell our products and implement our business plan in rapidly evolving markets requires an effective management planning process 
future product expansion efforts could be expensive and put a strain on our management by significantly increasing the scope of their responsibilities and by increasing the demands on their management abilities during periods of constrained spending 
we are focusing on the wireless areas as well as placing substantial effort on sustaining our leadership position in the analog modem space 
to effectively manage our growth in these new technologies  we must enhance our marketing  sales  research and development areas 
with revenues either stabilizing or declining  these efforts will have to be accomplished with limited resources 
this will require management to effectively manage significant technological advancement within reduced budgets 
competition within the connectivity and wireless networking industries is intense and is expected to increase significantly 
our failure to compete successfully could materially harm our prospects and financial results 
the connectivity device and wireless markets are intensely competitive 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or potential competitors 
our current competitors include agere systems  broadcom  conexant  ess technology and smart link 
we expect competition to increase in the future as current competitors enhance their product offerings  new suppliers enter the connectivity device and wireless markets  new communication technologies are introduced and as additional networks are deployed 
in addition  our client software competes with software developed internally by network interface card nic vendors  service providers for local networks  and with software developed by large systems integrators 
increased competition could adversely affect our business and operating results through pricing pressures  the loss of market share and other factors 
the principal competitive factors affecting wireless markets include the following maintaining effective data throughput and coverage area  interference immunity and network security and scalability  keeping product costs low while  at the same time  increasing roaming capability  decreasing power consumption and the size of products and improving product reliability  ease of use  brand recognition and product features and applications  integration with existing technology  maintaining industry standards and obtaining product certifications as wireless networks continue to become more sophisticated  decreasing product time to market  complying with changes to government regulations with respect to each country served and related to the use of radio spectrum  and obtaining favorable oem relationships  marketing alliances  effective distribution channels 
we could  in the future  be at a disadvantage to competitors in both the wireless and broadband markets that have broader distribution channels  brand recognition  extensive patent portfolios and more diversified product lines  particularly com  alcatel  analog devices  globespanvirata  intersil and proxim 
additionally  numerous companies have announced their intention to develop competing products in the connectivity products market  including several companies offering low price wlan products 
competitors in the market for products and technology that enable roaming between and among wireless and cellular networks include aptilo  boingo  bvrp  cisco  colubris  funk  gric  ibm  ipass  ipunplugged  microsoft  netnearu  nokia  nomadix  pronto networks  sierra wireless and starfish 
we could also face future competition from companies that offer alternative communications solutions  or from large computer companies  pc peripheral companies and other large networking equipment companies 
furthermore  we could face competition from certain of our customers  which have  or could acquire  wireless engineering and product development capabilities  or might elect to offer competing technologies 
we can offer no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against these competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not adversely affect our business or operating results 
many of our present and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  technical and other resources with which to pursue engineering  manufacturing  marketing  and distribution of their products 
these competitors may succeed in establishing technology standards or strategic alliances in the connectivity device and wireless markets  obtain more rapid market acceptance for their products  or otherwise gain a competitive advantage 
we can offer no assurance that we will succeed in developing products or technologies that are more effective than those developed by our competitors 
furthermore  we compete with companies that have high volume manufacturing and extensive marketing and distribution capabilities that we do not possess 
we can offer no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against existing and new competitors as the connectivity wireless markets evolve and the level of competition increases 
our business will depend on rapidly evolving telecommunications and internet industries 
our future success is dependent upon the continued growth of the data communications and wireless industries  particularly with regard to internet usage 
the global data communications and internet industries are evolving rapidly and it is difficult to predict potential growth rates or future trends in technology development 
we cannot assure you that the deregulation  privatization and economic globalization of the worldwide telecommunications market that has resulted in increased competition and escalating demand for new technologies and services will continue in a manner favorable to us or our business strategies 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the growth in demand for wireless and internet services  and the resulting need for high speed or enhanced data communications products and wireless systems  will continue at its current rate or at all 
our revenue may decline and our ability to grow our business may be threatened if the demand for wireless services in general and wlan products in particular does not continue to grow 
our success in the wireless market is dependent on the continued trend toward wireless telecommunications and data communications services 
if the rate of growth slows and service providers reduce their capital investments in wireless infrastructure or fail to expand into new geographic markets  our revenue may decline 
wireless access solutions are unproven in the marketplace and some of the wireless technologies have only been commercially introduced in the last few years 
we only began offering wireless products in the second quarter of fiscal if wireless access technology turns out to be unsuitable for widespread commercial deployment  we may not be able to generate enough sales to achieve and grow our business 
we have listed below some of the factors that we believe are key to the success or failure of wireless access technology reliability and security of wireless access technology and the perception by end users of its reliability and security  capacity to handle growing demands for faster transmission of increasing amounts of data  voice and video  the availability of sufficient frequencies for network service providers to deploy products at commercially reasonable rates  cost effectiveness and performance compared to wire line or other high speed access solutions  whose prices and performance continue to improve  suitability for a sufficient number of geographic regions  and availability of sufficient site locations for wireless access 
the factors listed above influence our customers purchase decisions when selecting wireless versus other high speed access technology 
for example  because of the frequency with which individuals using cellular phones experience fading or a loss of signal  customers often have the perception that all wireless technologies will have the same reliability constraints even though the wireless technology underlying wireless access products does not have the same problems as cellular phones 
in some geographic areas  because of adverse weather conditions that affect wireless transmissions  but not wire line technologies  wireless products are not as successful as wire line technology 
in addition  future legislation  legal decisions and regulation relating to the wireless telecommunications industry may slow or delay the deployment of wireless networks 
wireless access solutions  including wlans  compete with other high speed access solutions such as digital subscriber lines  cable modem technology  fiber optic cable and other high speed wire line and satellite technologies 
if the market for our wireless solutions fails to develop or develops more slowly than we expect due to this competition  our sales opportunities will be harmed 
many of these alternative technologies can take advantage of existing installed infrastructure and are generally perceived to be reliable and secure 
as a result  they have already achieved significantly greater market acceptance and penetration than wireless access technologies 
moreover  current wireless access technologies have inherent technical limitations that may inhibit their widespread adoption in many areas 
we expect wireless access technologies to face increasing competitive pressures from both current and future alternative technologies 
in light of these factors  many service providers may be reluctant to invest heavily in wireless access solutions  including wlans 
if service providers do not continue to establish wlan hot spots  we may not be able to generate sales for our wlan products and our revenue may decline 
connectivity devices generally require individual government approvals throughout the world to operate on local telephone networks 
these certifications  collectively referred to as homologation  can delay or impede the acceptance of our products on a worldwide basis 
connectivity products require extensive testing prior to receiving certification by each government to be authorized to connect to their telephone systems 
this testing can delay the introduction of or  in extreme cases  prohibit product usage in a particular country 
international telecommunications union standards seek to provide a worldwide standard to avoid these issues  but they do not eliminate the need for testing in each country 
in addition to government certifications  individual internet service providers can also have unique line conditions that must be addressed 
since most large pc manufacturers want to be able to release their products on a worldwide basis  this entire process can significantly slow the introduction of new products 
our gross margins may vary based on the mix of sales of our products and licenses of our intellectual property  and these variations may cause our net income to decline 
we derive a significant portion of our sales from our software based connectivity products 
we expect gross margins on newly introduced products generally to be higher than our existing products 
however  due in part to the competitive pricing pressures that affect our products and in part to increasing component and manufacturing costs  we expect gross margins from both existing and future products to decrease over time 
in addition  licensing revenues from our intellectual property historically have provided higher margins than our product sales 
changes in the mix of products sold and the percentage of our sales in any quarter attributable to products as compared to licensing revenues could cause our quarterly results to vary and could result in a decrease in gross margins and net income 
we may never achieve the anticipated benefits from our acquisition of dynamic telecommunications  inc 
we acquired dynamic telecommunications  inc in march as part of our continuing efforts to expand our wireless business and product offerings 
we may experience difficulties in achieving the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of dynamic telecommunications 
dynamic telecommunication s business utilizes software defined radio technology to optimize and plan wireless networks 
this acquisition represents a significant expansion of and new direction for our wireless business 
potential risks with this acquisition include possible impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of the acquisition of dynamic telecommunications  successfully developing and marketing security related applications for the software defined radio technology of dynamic telecommunications  inability to retain key employees of dynamic telecommunications  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  impairment of assets related to resulting goodwill  and reductions in our future operating results from amortization of intangible assets  and difficulties in assimilation of acquired personnel  operations  technologies or products 
furthermore  under the asset purchase agreement  pctel has an obligation to pay additional consideration to dynamic telecommunications if the business of dynamic telecommunications meets specified revenue targets 
any such earn out payments may be paid  at our option  in cash or a combination of cash and our common stock 
if the earn out payments are paid in common stock  this would dilute our existing stockholders 
we may experience integration or other problems with potential acquisitions  which could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
new acquisitions could dilute the interests of existing stockholders  and the announcement of new acquisitions could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 
we may in the future make acquisitions of  or large investments in  businesses that offer products  services  and technologies that we believe would complement our products or services  including wireless products and technology 
we may also make acquisitions of  or investments in  businesses that we believe could expand our distribution channels 
even if we were to announce an acquisition  we may not be able to complete it 
additionally  any future acquisition or substantial investment would present numerous risks  including difficulty in integrating the technology  operations or work force of the acquired business with our existing business  disruption of our on going business  difficulty in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of the transaction  difficulty in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  possible impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of integration of new businesses and management personnel  and impairment of assets related to resulting goodwill  and reductions in our future operating results from amortization of intangible assets 
we expect that future acquisitions could provide for consideration to be paid in cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and our common stock 
if consideration for a transaction is paid in common stock  this would further dilute our existing stockholders 
our revenues may fluctuate each quarter due to both domestic and international seasonal trends 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonality in sales of our connectivity products 
these seasonal trends materially affect our quarter to quarter operating results 
our revenues are typically higher in the third and fourth quarters due to back to school and holiday purchases as well as purchase decisions made based on the calendar year end budgeting requirements of purchasers of our products 
we are currently expanding our sales in international markets  particularly in asia 
to the extent that our revenues in asia or other parts of the world increase in future periods  we expect our period to period revenues to reflect seasonal buying patterns in these markets 
any delays in our normally lengthy sales cycles could result in customers canceling purchases of our products 
sales cycles for our products with major customers are lengthy  often lasting nine months or longer 
in addition  it can take an additional nine months or more before a customer commences volume production of equipment that incorporates our products 
we expect sales cycles for our wireless products to be lengthy as well 
sales cycles with our major customers are lengthy for a number of reasons  including our original equipment manufacturer customers usually complete a lengthy technical evaluation of our products  over which we have no control  before placing a purchase order  the commercial integration of our products by an original equipment manufacturer is typically limited during the initial release to evaluate product performance  and the development and commercial introduction of products incorporating new technologies frequently are delayed 
a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and is based in large part on our forecasts of volume and timing of orders 
the lengthy sales cycles make forecasting the volume and timing of product orders difficult 
in addition  the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks of customer decisions to cancel or change product phases 
if customer cancellations or product changes were to occur  this could result in the loss of anticipated sales without sufficient time for us to reduce our operating expenses 
we rely heavily on our intellectual property rights  which offer only limited protection against companies who may infringe upon our intellectual property 
unauthorized use of our technology may result in development of products that compete with our products  which could cause our market share and our revenues to be reduced 
our success is heavily dependent upon our proprietary technology 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
these means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate 
we have over patents granted or pending addressing both essential international telecommunications union and non essential technologies 
pending patents may never be issued 
these patents  both issued and pending  may not provide sufficiently broad protection against third party infringement lawsuits or they may not prove enforceable in actions against alleged infringers 
despite precautions that we take  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
we may provide our licensees with access to the proprietary information underlying our licensed applications 
additionally  our competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology 
finally  policing unauthorized use of software is difficult  and some foreign laws  including those of various countries in asia  do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as united states laws 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 
we are subject to litigation regarding intellectual property  which has diverted management attention  is costly to defend and could prevent us from using or selling the challenged technology 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving intellectual property rights  including rights of companies in our industry 
we have from time to time in the past received correspondence from third parties alleging that we infringe the third party s intellectual property rights 
we expect these claims to increase as our intellectual property portfolio becomes larger 
intellectual property claims against us  and any resulting lawsuit  may result in our incurring significant expenses and could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidate what we currently believe are our proprietary rights 
these lawsuits  regardless of their merits or success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and could divert management s time and attention 
any potential intellectual property litigation against us could also force us to do one or more of the following cease selling  incorporating or using products or services that incorporate the infringed intellectual property  obtain from the holder of the infringed intellectual property a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or redesign those products or services that incorporate the disputed intellectual property  which could result in substantial unanticipated development expenses 
the recent patent lawsuit with com 
if we are subject to a successful claim of infringement and we fail to develop non infringing intellectual property or license the infringed intellectual property on acceptable terms and on a timely basis  our revenues could decline or our expenses could increase 
we may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of our competitors 
these claims could also result in significant expense and the diversion of technical and management personnel s attention 
we have accrued for negotiated license fees and estimated royalty settlements related to existing and probable claims of patent infringement 
if the actual settlements exceed the amounts accrued  additional losses could be significant  which would adversely affect future operating results 
we recorded an accrual for estimated future royalty payments for relevant technology of others used in our product offerings in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the estimated royalties accrual reflects management s broader litigation and cost containment strategies  which may include alternatives such as entering into cross licensing agreements  cash settlements and or ongoing royalties based upon our judgment that such negotiated settlements would allow management to focus more time and financial resources on the ongoing business 
accordingly  the royalties accrual reflects estimated costs of settling claims rather than continuing to defend our legal positions  and is not intended to be  nor should it be interpreted as  an admission of infringement of intellectual property  valuation of damages suffered by any third parties or any specific terms that management has predetermined to agree to in the event of a settlement offer 
we have accrued our best estimate of the amount of royalties payable for royalty agreements already signed and unasserted  but probable  claims of others using advice from third party technology advisors and historical settlements 
should the final license agreements result in royalty rates significantly higher than our current estimates  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in order for us to operate at a profitable level and continue to introduce and develop new products for emerging markets  we must attract and retain our executive officers and qualified technical  sales  support and other administrative personnel 
our past performance has been and our future performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our current executive officers and certain key engineering  sales  marketing  financial  technical and customer support personnel 
if we lose the services of our executives or key employees  replacements could be difficult to recruit and  as a result  we may not be able to grow our business 
competition for personnel  especially qualified engineering personnel  is intense 
we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education  background and industry experience 
as of december   we employed a total of people in our engineering department 
if we lose the services of one or more of our key engineering personnel  our ability to continue to develop products and technologies responsive to our markets will be impaired 
we may have to continue to reduce our headcount  which may hinder our ability to develop and grow our business  which may ultimately affect our ability to be profitable 
in  we reduced our workforce by employees 
in  we further reduced our workforce by employees 
if economic conditions and the pc market do not improve  or if we decide to pursue new business structures or focus on different sectors  we may need to reduce our workforce further 
this may result in  as it has in the past  additional charges and costs relating to severance and employment costs  as well as the closure of excess facilities 
if such an action is taken  it may temporarily inhibit our ability to develop new products  our profitability and our ability to attract and retain other employees 
we have put in place cost reduction programs to reduce our expenses for the host signal processing businesses 
we may have to continue to reduce our expenses in this business  which may hinder our ability to become profitable 
as part of the cost reduction programs put in place on the hsp business in and  we reduced our workforce by employees in and an additional employees in if economic conditions and the pc market do not improve  we may need to continue to reduce expenses relating to the host signal processing business 
this may result in  as it has in the past  additional charges and costs relating to severance and employment costs  as well as the closure of excess facilities 
if such an action is taken  it may temporarily inhibit our ability to become profitable 
we rely on independent companies to manufacture  assemble and test our products 
if these companies do not meet their commitments to us  our ability to sell products to our customers would be impaired 
we do not have our own manufacturing  assembly or testing operations 
instead  we rely on independent companies to manufacture  assemble and test the semiconductor chips that are integral components of our products 
most of these companies are located outside of the united states 
there are many risks associated with our relationships with these independent companies  including reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  manufacturing costs  capacity during periods of excess demand  and access to process technologies 
in addition  the location of these independent parties outside of the united states creates additional risks resulting from the foreign regulatory  political and economic environments in which each of these companies exists 
further  some of these companies are located near earthquake fault lines 
while we have not experienced any material problems to date  failures or delays by our manufacturers to provide the semiconductor chips that we require for our products  or any material change in the financial arrangements we have with these companies  could have an adverse impact on our ability to meet our customer product requirements 
we design  market and sell application specific integrated circuits and outsource the manufacturing and assembly of the integrated circuits to third party fabricators 
the majority of our products and related components are manufactured by three principal companies taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation  admtek and silicon laboratories inc we expect to continue to rely upon these third parties for these services 
currently  the data access arrangement chips used in our soft modem products are provided by a sole source  silicon laboratories  on a purchase order basis  and we have only a limited guaranteed supply of data access arrangement chips through a long term business arrangement with silicon laboratories 
we have no guaranteed supply or long term contract agreements with any of our other suppliers 
although we believe that we would be able to qualify an alternative manufacturing source for data access arrangement chips within a relatively short period of time  this transition  if necessary  could result in loss of purchase orders or customer relationships  which could result in decreased revenues 
in addition  many of the potential alternative sources of components for our products that could potentially provide us with components have existing relationships with our competitors or potential competitors and may be unwilling to enter into agreements with us 
if our relationship with silicon laboratories  or any relationship we enter in the future with other manufacturers  is impaired for competitive reasons or otherwise  this could prevent us from being able to deliver our products  damage our customer relationships and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
undetected software errors or failures found in new products may result in a loss of customers or a delay in market acceptance of our products 
our products may contain undetected software errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
to date  we have not been made aware of any significant software errors or failures in our products 
however  despite testing by us and by current and potential customers  errors may be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of customers or delay in market acceptance 
our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected if tax authorities challenge us and the tax challenges result in unfavorable outcomes 
we currently have subsidiaries in japan  france  taiwan and yugoslavia as well as branch offices in taiwan and korea 
the complexities resulting from by operating in several different tax jurisdictions inevitably leads to an increased exposure to worldwide tax challenges our california facilities and the facilities of some of the independent companies upon which we rely to manufacture  assemble and test our products are located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 
our california facilities are located near major earthquake fault lines 
if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of our facilities is located  it could significantly disrupt our operations in that region 
in addition  some of the independent companies upon which we rely to manufacture substantially all of our products are located outside of the united states in places that have experienced significant earthquakes in the past and could be subject to additional earthquakes 
any earthquake or other natural disaster in regions where the companies that manufacture  assemble and test our products are located could materially disrupt production capabilities and could result in our experiencing a significant delay in delivery  or substantial shortage  of our products 
risks related to our industry if the market for products using our host signal processing technology does not grow as we plan  or if our products are not accepted in these markets  our revenues may be adversely affected 
our success depends on market demand and growth patterns for products using our host signal processing  or hsp  technology in soft analog modems 
market success for our products depends primarily on cost and performance benefits relative to competing solutions 
although we have shipped a significant number of soft modems since we began commercial sales of these products  the current level of demand for soft modems may not continue or increase 
further  our success in the soft modem market is dependent on developing  selling and supporting next generation products and applications 
if these new products are not accepted in the markets as they are introduced  our revenues and profitability will be negatively affected 
if the wireless market does not grow as we anticipate  or if our wireless products are not accepted in these markets  our revenues may be adversely affected 
our future success depends on market demand and growth patterns for products using wireless technology 
our wireless products may not be successful as a result of the following reasons intense competition in the wireless market  our relative inexperience in developing  marketing  selling and supporting these products  and inability of these products to complement our legacy business 
if these new wireless products are not accepted in the markets as they are introduced  our revenues and profitability will be negatively affected 
our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies 
if we are not successful in response to rapidly changing technologies  our products may become obsolete and we may not be able to compete effectively 
the internet access business is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  short product life cycles and frequent new product introductions 
to remain competitive  we have successfully introduced several new products with advanced technologies since pctel was founded 
we continue to develop and sell advanced analog modem products in order to remain competitive in our core business 
the market for high speed internet connectivity is also characterized by rapidly changing technologies and strong competition  such as broadband and wireless solutions  which provide higher modem speeds and faster internet access 
while these alternative technologies offer much faster data rates  they are comparatively more costly than analog modems 
they are also not as widely available in the world markets 
we will continue to evaluate  develop and introduce technologically advanced products that will position us for possible growth in the internet access market 
if we are not successful in response to rapidly changing technologies  our products may become obsolete and we may not be able to compete effectively 
changes in laws or regulations  in particular  future fcc regulations affecting the broadband market  internet service providers  or the communications industry  could negatively affect our ability to develop new technologies or sell new products and therefore  reduce our profitability 
the jurisdiction of the federal communications commission  or fcc  extends to the entire communications industry  including our customers and their products and services that incorporate our products 
future fcc regulations affecting the broadband access services industry  our customers or our products may harm our business 
for example  future fcc regulatory policies that affect the availability of data and internet services may impede our customers penetration into their markets or affect the prices that they are able to charge 
in addition  international regulatory bodies are beginning to adopt standards for the communications industry 
although our business has not been hurt by any regulations to date  in the future  delays caused by our compliance with regulatory requirements may result in order cancellations or postponements of product purchases by our customers  which would reduce our profitability

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks 
we manage the sensitivity of our results of operations to credit risks and interest rate risk by maintaining a conservative investment portfolio which is comprised solely of highly rated  short term investments 
we have investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted based on the duration of such investments if interest rates rise  while floating rate securities and the reinvestment of funds from matured fixed rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations with ratings of a or better  and money market funds
