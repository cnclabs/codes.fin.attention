the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operation should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report on form k 
descriptions of all documents incorporated by reference herein or included as exhibits hereto are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such documents so incorporated or referenced 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to  those under risk factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a media  marketing services and direct marketing company targeting generation y  the more than million boys and girls in the united states between the ages of and our business integrates direct mail catalogs  print media  websites  display media boards  on campus marketing programs and promotional events  and features a portfolio of brands that are well known among generation y consumers and advertisers 
we reach a significant portion of generation y consumers through our various media assets  direct marketing activities and marketing services programs  and  as a result  we are able to offer advertisers targeted access to the youth market and to sell third party branded products in key generation y spending categories  including apparel  action sports equipment and accessories  directly to the youth market 
additionally  our assets have enabled us to build a comprehensive database that includes detailed information about more than million generation y consumers 
we believe we are the only generation y focused media company that combines significant marketing reach with a comprehensive consumer database  providing us with a deep understanding of the youth market 
we were incorporated in january  launched our alloy website in august  and began generating meaningful revenues in august following the distribution of our first alloy catalog 
since then  we have grown rapidly  both organically and through the completion of strategic acquisitions 
we generate revenue from two principal sources merchandising  and sponsorship and other activities 
our merchandising segment derives revenues and operating income from sales of youth focused merchandise comprising apparel  accessories and action sports equipment to consumers through our catalogs and websites 
our sponsorship and other activities segment derives revenues largely from traditional  blue chip advertisers that seek highly targeted  measurable and effective marketing programs to reach generation y members 
advertisers can reach members of generation y through integrated marketing programs that include our catalogs  magazines  books  websites  and display media boards  as well as through promotional events  product sampling  college and high school newspaper advertising  customer acquisition programs and other marketing services that we provide 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to customer incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
in december  the securities and exchange commission the sec requested that all registrants list their three to five most critical accounting policies in md a 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe  however  the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition merchandise revenues are recognized at the time products are shipped to customers  net of any promotional price discounts and an allowance for sales returns 
the allowance for sales returns is estimated based upon our return policy  historical experience and evaluation of current sales trends 
merchandise revenues also include shipping and handling billed to customers 
shipping and handling costs are reflected in selling and marketing expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  and approximated million  million and million for the years ended january   and  respectively 
sponsorship revenues consist primarily of advertising provided for third parties in our media properties 
revenue under these arrangements is recognized  net of the commissions and agency fees  when the underlying advertisement is published  broadcasted or otherwise delivered pursuant to the terms of each arrangement 
delivery of advertising in other media forms is completed either in the form of the display of an impression or based upon the provision of contracted services in connection with the marketing event or program 
in catalog print advertising revenues are recognized as earned pro rata on a monthly basis over the estimated economic life of the catalog 
advertising costs are recognized in conjunction with associated revenue recognition  and any direct response advertising costs are expensed ratably over the estimated economic life of each catalog 
billings in advance of advertising delivery are deferred until earned 
other revenues consist of book development publishing revenue and other service contracts 
publishing revenues and related costs are recognized upon publication of each property 
service revenues are recognized as the contracted services are rendered 
in our advertising placement activities  an analysis of our pricing and collection risk  among other tests  is made to determine whether revenue is reported on a gross or net basis 
catalog costs catalog costs consist of catalog production and mailing costs 
catalog costs are capitalized and charged to expense over the expected future revenue stream  which is principally three to four months from the date the catalogs are mailed 
an estimate of the future sales dollars to be generated from each individual catalog drop is used in the our catalog costs policy 
the estimate of future sales is calculated for each catalog drop using historical trends for similar catalog drops mailed in prior periods as well as the overall current sales trend for the catalog brand 
this estimate is compared with the actual sales generated to date for the catalog drop to determine the percentage of total catalog costs to be classified as prepaid on our balance sheet 
prepaid catalog costs on the consolidated balance sheets and selling expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income are affected by these estimates 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is principally determined by the first in  first out method 
we record adjustments to the value of inventory based upon our forecasted plans to sell our inventories 
the physical condition eg  age and quality of the inventories is also considered in establishing its valuation 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from the amounts that we may ultimately realize upon the disposition of inventories if future economic conditions  trends  or competitive conditions differ from our estimates and expectations 
these estimates affect the balance of inventory on our consolidated balance sheets and cost of goods sold on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income 
accounts receivable a portion of our accounts receivable will not be collected due to customer issues and bankruptcies 
we provide reserves for these situations based on the evaluation of the aging of our accounts receivable portfolio and a customer by customer analysis of our high risk customers 
our reserves contemplate our historical writeoffs on receivables  specific customer situations  and the economic environments in which we operate 
estimating an allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant management judgment and is dependent upon the overall economic environment and our customer viability 
these estimates affect the balance of accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets and selling and marketing expenses on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill  which represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired  was being amortized on a straight line basis over the expected future periods to be benefited  ranging from three to five years 
effective february   we adopted sfas no 
 which eliminates amortization of goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives  and requires these assets to be subject to annual impairments tests 
intangible assets consist of trademarks  mailing lists  noncompetition agreements  websites and marketing rights acquired in connection with our business acquisitions 
trademarks currently have indefinite lives  however  the other identified intangible assets are amortized over their expected benefit periods  ranging from two to seven years 
we completed the annual impairment test required by sfas no 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal by comparing the fair value of our reporting units with their carrying values 
we also reassessed the useful lives of other intangibles that are amortized 
as of january  we concluded that the fair values of the reporting units exceeded the carrying values of the reporting units 
therefore  no impairment charge was recognized in fiscal and no changes were made to the useful lives of our intangibles 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of our reporting units which may be impacted by future actions taken by us and our competitors and the economic environment in which we operate 
these estimates affect the balance of goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets and operating expenses on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income

total operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of catalog production and mailing costs  our call center and fulfillment operations expenses  freight costs in shipping to our merchandise customers  salaries of our sales and marketing personnel  marketing costs  and expenses related to the development  maintenance and marketing of our websites 
these selling and marketing expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  due to the increased costs incurred in marketing  selling and shipping merchandise to our expanded database in greater volume  the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel  the addition of sales staff associated with acquired media and marketing services businesses  and increased spending on website maintenance 
as a percentage of total revenues  our selling and marketing expenses decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal this decrease was due primarily to more targeted merchandise marketing to our enlarged database  improved advertising sales force productivity and reduced general advertising and marketing activity 
fulfillment expenses including credit card processing charges rose to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due to the increase in merchandise revenues 
as a percentage of net merchandise revenues  fulfillment expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal due mainly to improved labor requirement forecasting and productivity 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for our executive  administrative  finance and management personnel  as well as support services and professional service fees 
these expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was attributable primarily to an increase in compensation expense for additional personnel to handle our growing business  together with administrative costs related to acquired companies and expenses associated with a growing public company such as increased professional fees  insurance premiums and public relations costs 
as a percentage of total revenues  our general and administrative expenses decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal as we spread our overhead expenses across an enlarged revenue base 
we expect general and administrative expenses to grow as we hire additional personnel and incur additional expenses related to the growth of our business and our operations 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was approximately million for fiscal as compared with million for fiscal these costs resulted from our acquisition activities  which commenced in fiscal all of our acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
as further discussed in recent accounting pronouncements below  in fiscal  we adopted statement no 
which eliminates the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and requires an annual impairment review of such assets 
accordingly  amortization expense decreased to million in fiscal  as compared with million in fiscal  as a result of adoption of this standard 
restructuring charge to write off abandoned facility leases and equipment 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we wrote off an abandoned facility lease and equipment no longer required in our business operations when we determined that we could not exit the lease or sublease the space

we will continue to review our operations to determine the necessity of our facilities  equipment and personnel

our gross profit as a percentage of total revenues decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal due to the inclusion of lower margin ccs merchandise sales from july when our ccs acquisition closed  partially offset by an increased overall revenue percentage of higher margin sponsorship and other revenues generated in fiscal operating expenses selling and marketing

these more than offset increased amortization expenses 
merchandise income loss from operations 
our loss from merchandise operations decreased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal the merchandise loss was reduced in fiscal as our expanded name database allowed us to target our catalog circulation to more receptive consumers  thereby increasing our catalog productivity 
this more than offset increased amortization expenses 
sponsorship and other income loss from operations 
our income from sponsorship and other operations was million for fiscal  while our loss from sponsorship and other operations was million for fiscal the improvement from operating loss to operating income resulted from our expanded and more productive advertising sales force and the increased range of services sold and clients serviced

income tax benefit expense in fiscal we were subject to income tax expense of  due to taxable operating income generated at the state level 
in fiscal we had no income tax expense as we incurred tax losses 
seasonality our historical revenues and operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter due to seasonal fluctuations in consumer purchasing patterns and the impact of acquisitions 
sales of apparel  accessories  footwear and action sports equipment through our websites and catalogs have been higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters  which contain the key back to school and holiday selling seasons  than in our first and second fiscal quarters 
we believe that advertising and sponsorship sales follow a similar pattern with higher revenues in the third and fourth quarters  particularly the third quarter  as marketers more aggressively attempt to reach our generation y audience during these major spending seasons 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations to date primarily through the sale of equity and debt securities as we generated negative cash flow from operations prior to fiscal at january   we had approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments

net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal increased from million in fiscal due to an increase in net income after adjustments for non cash items of million  resulting from more efficient database marketing  greater advertising sales force productivity  general expense control and a tax benefit  offset in part by increased inventory to support future merchandise sales  increased accounts receivable resultant from our expanded advertising sales base and the establishment of deferred tax assets

in fiscal  we recorded a charge related to accretion and dividends of million 
our liquidity position as of january  consisted of million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we expect our liquidity position to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures  excluding potential acquisitions  for at least the next months 
if cash generated from our operations is insufficient to satisfy our cash needs  we may be required to raise additional capital 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  our stockholders may experience significant dilution 
furthermore  additional financing may not be available when we need it or  if available  financing may not be on terms favorable to us or to our stockholders 
if financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products or services

such statements are subject to certain factors  risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  events and performance to differ materially from those referred to or implied by such statements 
in addition  actual future results may differ materially from those anticipated  depending on a variety of factors  which include  but are not limited to  achieving and maintaining profitability  expanding and utilizing our database  our ability to build brand recognition  and our ability to increase our advertising customers and programs 
information with respect to important factors that should be considered is contained in the risk factors that may affect future results section below 
you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
we do not intend to update any of the forward looking statements to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in management s expectations  except as required by law 
risk factors that may affect future results the following risk factors and other information included in this report should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
risks related to our business we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability 
since our inception in january  we have incurred significant net losses 
we have reported positive net income for only one full fiscal year fiscal 
although we expect to generate positive net income in fiscal  there is no assurance that we will do so 
as of january   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our business may not grow in the future 
since our inception  we have rapidly expanded our business  growing from revenues of million for fiscal to million for fiscal our continued growth will depend to a significant degree on our ability to increase revenues from our merchandising businesses  to maintain existing sponsorship and advertising relationships and to develop new relationships  to integrate acquisitions  and to maintain and enhance the reach and brand recognition of our existing media franchises and new media franchises that we create or acquire 
our ability to implement our growth strategy will also depend on a number of other factors  many of which are or may be beyond our control including i the continuing appeal of our media and marketing properties to generation y consumers  ii the continued perception by participating advertisers and sponsors that we offer an effective marketing channel for their products and services  iii our ability to select products that appeal to our customer base and to market such products effectively to our target audience  iv our ability to attract  train and retain qualified employees and management and v our ability to make additional strategic acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement our growth strategy successfully 
we may fail to use our generation y database and our expertise in marketing to generation y consumers successfully  and we may not be able to maintain the quality and size of our database 
the effective use of our generation y consumer database and our expertise in marketing to generation y are important components of our business 
if we fail to capitalize on these assets  our business will be less successful 
as individuals in our database age beyond generation y  they may no longer be of significant value to our business 
we must therefore continuously obtain data on new individuals in the generation y demographic in order to maintain and increase the size and value of our database 
if we fail to obtain sufficient new names and information  our business could be adversely affected 
moreover  there are other generation y focused media businesses that possess similar information about some segments of generation y 
we compete for sponsorship and advertising revenues based on the comprehensive nature of our database and our ability to analyze and interpret the data in our database 
accordingly  if one or more of our competitors were to create a database similar to ours  or if a competitor were able to analyze its data more effectively than we can  our competitive position  and therefore our business  could suffer 
our success depends largely on the value of our brands  and if the value of our brands were to diminish  our business would be adversely affected 
the prominence of our alloy  ccs  dan s comp and girlfriends la catalogs and websites and our related consumer magazines among our generation y target market  and the prominence of our marketplace media  cass communications  youth and private colleges universities brands and media franchises with advertisers are key components of our business 
if our consumer brands or their associated merchandise and editorial content lose their appeal to generation y consumers  our business could be adversely affected 
the value of our consumer brands could also be eroded by misjudgments in merchandise selection or by our failure to keep our content current with the evolving preferences of our audience 
these events would likely also reduce sponsorship and advertising sales for our merchandise and publishing businesses and may also adversely affect our marketing and services businesses 
moreover  we anticipate that we will continue to increase the number of generation y consumers we reach  through means which may include broadening the intended audience of our existing consumer brands or creating or acquiring new media franchises or related businesses 
misjudgments by us in this regard could damage our existing or future brands 
if any of these developments occur  our business would suffer 
our revenues and income could decline due to general economic trends  declines in consumer spending and seasonality 
our revenues are largely generated by discretionary consumer spending or advertising seeking to stimulate that spending 
advertising expenditures and consumer spending all tend to decline during recessionary periods  and may also decline at other times 
accordingly  our revenues could decline during any general economic downturn 
in addition  our revenues have historically been higher during our third and fourth fiscal quarters  coinciding with the start of the school calendar and holiday season spending  than in the first half of our fiscal year 
therefore  our results of operations in our third and fourth fiscal quarters may not be indicative of our full fiscal year performance 
our inability to acquire suitable businesses or to manage their integration could harm our business 
we expect to expand our reach by acquiring complementary businesses  products and services 
we compete with other media and related businesses for these opportunities 
therefore  even if we identify targets we consider desirable  we may not be able to complete those acquisitions on terms we consider attractive or at all 
we could have difficulty in assimilating personnel and operations of the businesses we have acquired and may have similar problems with future acquisitions 
these difficulties could disrupt our business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
furthermore  we may issue additional equity securities in connection with acquisitions  potentially on terms which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
we must effectively manage our vendors to minimize inventory risk and maintain our margins 
we seek to avoid maintaining high inventory levels in an effort to limit the risk of outdated merchandise and inventory writedowns 
if we underestimate quantities demanded by our customers and our vendors cannot restock  then we may disappoint customers who may then turn to our competitors 
we require our vendors to meet minimum restocking requirements  but if our vendors cannot meet these requirements and we cannot find alternative vendors  we could be forced to carry more inventory than we have in the past 
our risk of inventory writedowns would increase if we were to hold large inventories of merchandise that prove to be unpopular 
competition may adversely affect our business and cause our stock price to decline 
because of the growing perception that generation y is an attractive demographic for marketers  the markets in which we operate are competitive 
many of our existing competitors  as well as potential new competitors in this market  have longer operating histories  greater brand recognition  larger customer user bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
these advantages allow our competitors to spend considerably more on marketing and may allow them to use their greater resources more effectively than we can use ours 
accordingly  these competitors may be better able to take advantage of market opportunities and be better able to withstand market downturns than us 
if we fail to compete effectively  our business will be materially and adversely affected and our stock price will decline 
we rely on third parties for some essential business operations  and disruptions or failures in service may adversely affect our ability to deliver goods and services to our customers 
we depend on third parties for important aspects of our business  including most of our call center and fulfillment operations 
we have limited control over these third parties  and we are not their only client 
to the extent some of our inventory is held by these third parties  we also may face losses as a result of inadequate security at these third party facilities 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain satisfactory relationships with any of these third parties on acceptable commercial terms 
further  we cannot be certain that the quality of products and services that they provide will remain at the levels needed to enable us to conduct our business effectively 
we depend on our key personnel to operate our business  and we may not be able to hire enough additional management and other personnel to manage our growth 
our performance is substantially dependent on the continued efforts of our executive officers and other key employees 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers could adversely affect our business 
additionally  we must continue to attract  retain and motivate talented management and other highly skilled employees to be successful 
we may be unable to retain our key employees or attract  assimilate and retain other highly qualified employees in the future 
we are vulnerable to new tax obligations that could be imposed on catalog and online commerce transactions 
we do not collect sales or other similar taxes for shipments of goods into most states 
however  various states or foreign countries may seek to impose sales tax obligations on us for our catalog and online merchandise sales 
proposals have been made at state and local levels that would impose additional taxes on the sale of goods and services through catalogs and the internet 
those proposals  if adopted  could substantially impair the growth of our merchandising businesses by making direct sales comparatively less attractive to consumers than traditional retail purchasing 
if this proposed legislation were to become law  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we could face liability or our ability to conduct business could be adversely affected by government and private actions concerning personally identifiable data  including privacy 
our direct marketing and database dependant businesses are subject to federal and state regulations requiring that we maintain the confidentiality of the names and personal information of our customers and the individuals included in our database 
if we do not comply  we could become subject to liability 
while these provisions do not currently unduly restrict our ability to operate our business  if those regulations become more restrictive  they could adversely affect our business 
in addition  laws or regulations that could impair our ability to collect and use user names and other information on our websites may adversely affect our business 
for example  a federal law currently limits our ability to collect personal information from website visitors who may be under age further  claims could also be based on other misuses of personal information  such as for unauthorized marketing purposes 
if we violate any of these laws  we could face a civil penalty 
in addition  the attorneys general of various states review company websites and their privacy policies from time to time 
in particular  an attorney general may examine such privacy policies to assure that the policies overtly and explicitly inform users of the manner in which the information they provide will be used and disclosed by the company 
if one or more attorneys general were to determine that our privacy policies fail to conform with state law  we also could face fines or civil penalties 
we could face liability for information displayed in our print publication media or displayed on or accessible via our websites 
we may be subjected to claims for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement or based on other theories relating to the information we publish in any of our print publication media and on our websites 
these types of claims have been brought  sometimes successfully  against marketing and media companies in the past 
we may be subject to liability based on statements made and actions taken as a result of participation in our chat rooms or as a result of materials posted by members on bulletin boards on our websites 
based on links we provide to third party websites  we could also be subjected to claims based upon online content we do not control that is accessible from our websites 
we could face liability for breaches of security on the internet 
to the extent that our activities or the activities of third party contractors involve the storage and transmission of information  such as credit card numbers  security breaches could disrupt our business  damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
we could be liable for claims based on unauthorized purchases with credit card information  impersonation or other similar fraud claims 
these claims could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
risks relating to our common stock our stock price has been volatile  is likely to continue to be volatile  and could decline substantially 
the price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  volatile 
in addition  the stock market in general  and companies whose stock is listed on the nasdaq national market  including marketing and media companies  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
we are a defendant in class action suits and defending these litigations could hurt our business 
we have been named as a defendant in a securities class action lawsuit relating to the allocation of shares by the underwriters of our initial public offering 
we also have been named as a defendant in several purported securities class action lawsuits stemming from a series of allegedly false and misleading statements made by us to the market between august  and january  defending against these litigations could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources  which could hurt our business 
in addition  if we lose either or both of these litigations  or settle either or both on adverse terms  or on terms outside of our insurance policy limits  our stock price may be adversely affected 
terrorist attacks and other acts of wider armed conflict may have an adverse effect on the us and world economies and may adversely affect our business 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war  such as those that took place on september   could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states or its businesses or interests 
attacks or armed conflicts that directly impact the internet or our physical facilities could significantly affect our business and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results 
further  the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the us and world economies could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
finally  further terrorist acts could cause the united states to enter into a wider armed conflict which could further disrupt our operations and result in a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and overall financial condition 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
as of the end of fiscal  we held a portfolio of million in fixed income marketable securities for which  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  interest rate risk is mitigated 
we do not own any derivative financial instruments in our portfolio 
accordingly  we do not believe there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivatives or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item
