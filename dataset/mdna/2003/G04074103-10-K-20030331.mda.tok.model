item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion and analysis should be read together with the consolidated financial statements of apex silver mines limited and the selected financial data and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on form k 
apex limited is a mining exploration and development company that holds a portfolio of silver exploration and development properties primarily in south america  mexico  central america and central asia 
we currently focus our resources primarily on the development and financing of our san cristobal project in bolivia 
at present  none of our properties are in production and  consequently  we have no current operating income or cash flow 
our company completed an initial public offering of ordinary shares on december  we completed a subsequent offering of ordinary shares and warrants during november restatement of prior years in march  we discovered that an employee had embezzled approximately million over a month period ending in february we have filed both civil and criminal charges against the former employee and are seeking to recover the amounts stolen 
while we believe our internal controls are adequate and that there are no material weaknesses  management is reviewing internal controls with the assistance of outside accounting specialists to determine any appropriate improvements 
we have restated certain amounts in our financial statements for the fiscal years ended december  and to reflect the losses resulting from the embezzlement 
no credits have been recorded against those losses 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended december   and see note for additional information about the effect on our quarterly results in  and in  the losses resulting from the embezzlement totaled million  which is included in the million total 
the restated amounts are reflected in the following discussion and analysis 
results of operations interest and other income 
our company does not yet produce silver or any other mineral products and has no revenues from product sales 
our primary source of income is interest income 
our policy is to invest all excess cash in liquid  high credit quality  short term financial instruments 
our interest and other income for the year ended december  was million compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest and other income compared to is primarily the result of lower average cash balances and lower interest rates during the decrease in interest and other income for compared to was also due to lower average cash balances and lower interest rates during as compared to trading gains and losses 
our company currently engages in limited metals trading activities utilizing puts and calls and other trading instruments in anticipation of potential lender requirements for the san cristobal project financing 
we measured the fair value of open positions at each reporting date during  recording the difference in the carrying value to current earnings  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas  which we adopted january  adoption of fas had no effect on our results of operations or financial position as previously we had marked open positions to market and included gains or losses in earnings 
we recorded a trading loss for the year ended of approximately million compared to a trading loss of approximately million for and a trading gain of approximately million for the improvement in of a million loss as compared to the million loss in is primarily the result of a smaller deterioration in the value of our long position in zinc during the million loss as compared to the million gain in is primarily the result of marking our long position in zinc  and to a lesser extent  silver to market 
inception to date  we have recorded a loss of approximately million related to the trading program 
of that amount  approximately million represents cash losses and the remaining million represents unrealized losses at december  under fas  fair value measurements may vary substantially from period to period based on spot prices  forward prices and quoted option volatilities 
exploration 
our company expenses mineral exploration expenditures on each property as incurred until we determine that mining operations on that property are feasible 
once we have determined that a mineral property has proven and probable ore reserves  we capitalize all development costs 
through december   we have expensed all acquisition and exploration costs as incurred 
since september   we have capitalized development costs associated with the san cristobal project and will continue to do so in the future 
our exploration expenses  including property holding costs and allocated administrative expenses  were million  including the million value of shares issued to acquire and maintain mineral rights  for the year ended december  as compared to million  including the million value of shares issued to acquire mineral rights  for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the decreases in our exploration expenses since are due primarily to the increased emphasis on conserving our cash balances 
administrative 
our administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in our administrative expenses since is primarily the result of cost savings associated with the reduction of personnel and office facilities as part of our cash conserving policy 
in addition  the and expenses include million and million respectively  for the value of stock  options and warrants issued to consultants in lieu of cash 
as a result of the employee embezzlement  the company recognized a loss through a charge to administrative expense  included in the amounts above  and a reduction of the carrying value of its mineral properties in the amount of million  million and million for the years ended december   and respectively 
income taxes 
apex silver mines corporation  our us management services company  is subject to us income taxes 
otherwise our company pays no income tax in the us since we are incorporated in the cayman islands and do not conduct or expect to conduct business that generates us taxable income 
the cayman islands currently impose no corporate taxation 
our company has been granted exemption until january  from any form of corporate taxation that may subsequently be adopted in the cayman islands 
deferred tax assets of approximately million at december   resulting from operating loss carryforwards of our company s subsidiaries  have been entirely offset by valuation allowances 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our company had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  the increase in our cash and cash equivalents during is the result of million in proceeds received from the sale of ordinary shares and million in proceeds from the exercise of our company s stock options by certain employees  consultants and former directors  reduced by million invested in property  plant and equipment related to the development of the san cristobal project  million used to fund operations  property holding costs and administrative costs  net of interest and other income and  a million payment on outstanding notes 
our company has a universal shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission that became effective september  the universal shelf registration statement allows us to raise up to million by selling any combination of equity or debt securities listed in the statement 
proceeds from offerings under the shelf registration  if any  may be used to construct and develop san cristobal  continue exploring our other properties  maintain control or ownership of our properties and acquire additional mining related properties or businesses  and for general corporate purposes 
from the effective date of the shelf registration statement through december  a total of  ordinary shares valued at million had been issued as summarized in the following table description of issuances number of ordinary shares issued recorded value of ordinary shares issued sale of ordinary shares payment of consulting fees purchase and maintain mineral rights payment of notes payable totals the major pre financing expenditures related to san cristobal have been completed and unless there is an improvement in metals markets in  we expect to limit project spending during the year to approximately million for continuing work on our transportation  port and power arrangements and payment of holding and permitting costs 
in addition  in order to maintain our current portfolio of mineral properties  we expect to make lease  patent and option payments during the next twelve months of about million 
there also is likely to be some discretionary spending on attractive new exploration opportunities as they arise 
total administrative expenses are not expected to exceed million during  net of interest and other income 
our company could maintain its current properties and retain key personnel while significantly reducing its expenditures should we deem it strategically desirable to do so 
we plan to fund our project and operating expenditures from our existing cash balances or  as in and  we may issue limited amounts of stock 
we will be required to raise significant additional debt and equity financing from outside sources to complete development of the san cristobal project 
based on estimated revisions made during to the september feasibility study for the san cristobal project  which assumes contract mining  we forecast capital costs for construction to total approximately million net of approximately million in expected tax credits  including approximately million which will be recovered against our company s future bolivian income taxes after commencement of production 
we have spent approximately million on construction costs through december  and have expended over million in total project capital to date 
when and if metals markets improve  our company expects to complete detailed engineering and incorporate into our feasibility study any changes deriving from our ultimate infrastructure arrangements  which may result in increases to our forecasted construction capital and working capital requirements 
we continue to work with our co lead arrangers for project financing  barclays capital and deutsche bank securities inc  as well as several multilateral funding agencies  to develop multilateral financing options for san cristobal as part of a total financing package that may incorporate support from other official agencies as well as debt financing from banks and the use of capital markets 
there can be no assurance that metals or capital markets will improve or that we will be able to obtain the required financing on terms that we find attractive  or at all 
environmental compliance our current and future exploration and development activities  as well as our future mining and processing operations  are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we conduct our activities 
these laws and regulations govern the protection of the environment  prospecting  development  production  taxes  labor standards  occupational health  mine safety  toxic substances and other matters 
our management expects to be able to comply with those laws and does not believe that compliance will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position 
we intend to obtain all licenses and permits required by all applicable regulatory agencies in connection with our mining operations and exploration activities 
we intend to maintain standards of environmental compliance consistent with best contemporary industry practice 
critical accounting policies the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have changed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules  and the use of judgment  to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
we make every effort to properly comply with all applicable rules on or before their adoption  and we believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules is critical 
our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
you should also read note of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
our financial condition and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements are affected by estimates that we  or experts that we have retained  have made as to our proven and probable reserves 
reserve estimates involve subjective judgment and are based on numerous assumptions that may later prove to be inaccurate 
these estimates include engineering evaluations of assay values derived from samplings of drill holes and other openings 
additionally  changes in the market prices of metals may render certain reserves containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to mine 
further  availability of permits  changes in operating and capital costs  and other factors could materially and adversely affect ore reserves 
we expense general prospecting costs and the costs of acquiring and exploring unevaluated mining properties 
when a property is determined to have proven and probable reserves  development costs are capitalized 
mineral properties include costs to acquire development properties and property development costs 
when proven and probable ore reserves are developed and operations commence  capitalized costs will be amortized using the units of production method based upon estimated recoverable proven and probably reserves 
upon abandonment or sale of projects  all capital costs relating to the specific project are written off in the period abandoned or sold and a gain or loss is recognized 
beginning september   all costs associated with the san cristobal project have been capitalized 
we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the sum of estimated future net cash flows on an undiscounted basis is less than the carrying amount of the related asset  an asset impairment is considered to exist 
the related impairment loss is measured by comparing estimated future net cash flows on a discounted basis to the carrying amount of the asset 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currently  our major principal cash balances are held in us dollars 
we maintain minimum cash balances in foreign currencies and therefore have a relative low exposure to currency fluctuations 
because we conduct our activities in several foreign countries  we may in the future engage in hedging activities to minimize the risk of exposure to currency and interest rate fluctuations 
to complete the project financing for san cristobal  our company expects to be required to hedge a portion of its planned production 
in addition  when san cristobal enters production  we may sell forward a portion of our production and use price hedging techniques to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuating metals prices 
our company currently engages in limited metals trading activities  utilizing puts and calls and other market instruments in anticipation of potential lender requirements for the san cristobal project financing
