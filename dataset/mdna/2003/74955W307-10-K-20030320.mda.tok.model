table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this item should be read in conjunction with the audited  consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that are included in item unless otherwise indicated  the terms company  donnelley  we  us and our refer to rh donnelley corporation and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries 
on january   we acquired all the outstanding common stock of spa  sprint corporation s directory publishing business 
see significant business development below 
as a result  commencing in our operating and financial results will no longer reflect sales commissions or pre press fees from or other transactions with spa since these intercompany transactions will be eliminated in consolidation 
rather  we will report the full value of advertising sales and certain direct costs under the deferral and amortization method 
in order to facilitate discussion of our historical results as opposed to our future results  we use the past tense when referring to operating and financial results for the years through dontech remains unchanged following the spa transaction and our financial presentation of dontech will appear consistently in both historical and future periods 
forward looking information certain statements contained in this annual report on form k regarding rh donnelley s future operating results  performance  business plans or prospects and any other statements not constituting historical fact are forward looking statements subject to the safe harbor created by the private securities litigation reform act of where possible  words such as believe  expect  anticipate  should  will  would  planned  estimated  potential  goal  outlook  could  and similar expressions  are used to identify such forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements reflect only our current beliefs and assumptions with respect to our future results  business plans  and prospects  and are based solely on information currently available to us 
accordingly  these statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties and our actual results  business plans and prospects could differ significantly from those expressed in  or implied by  these statements 
we caution readers not to place undue reliance on  and we undertake no obligation to update  any forward looking statements 
such risks and uncertainties include  without limitation  the following our ability to meet our substantial debt service obligations we have a substantial amount of debt and significant debt service obligations in and thereafter 
after closing the spa acquisition  we had total outstanding debt of  million at january  this debt was comprised of borrowings of  million under our new  million credit facility  million senior notes  million notes and  following a tender offer and exit consent solicitation  million aggregate remaining principal amount of the senior subordinated notes issued in the existing notes 
as a result of our significant amount of debt and debt service obligations  we face increasing risks associated with  but not limited to  the following our ability to obtain additional financing in excess of the additional borrowing capacity under our million revolving credit facility on satisfactory terms to fund working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions  investments  debt service requirements and other general corporate requirements is limited  we are more vulnerable to general economic downturns  competition and industry conditions  which could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged  we face increased exposure to rising interest rates as a portion of our debt is at variable interest rates  we have reduced availability of cash flow to fund working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions  investments and other general corporate requirements because a substantial portion of our cash flow will be needed to service our debt obligations  and we have limited flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 

table of contents our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance and our ability to refinance debt 
if we are unable to service our debt and fund our business  we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  seek additional debt financing or equity capital  restructure or refinance our debt or sell assets 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain additional financing  refinance existing debt or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all 
restrictive covenants under the terms of our debt and preferred stock agreements the indentures governing the notes and the credit facility include a number of significant restrictive covenants 
these covenants could adversely affect us by limiting our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or to meet our capital needs 
these covenants  among other things  restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt  pay dividends on our equity interests or repurchase equity interests  make certain investments  enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates  place restrictions on our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us  use assets as security in other transactions  and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies 
in addition  the credit facility includes other and more restrictive covenants and prohibits us from prepaying the notes and existing notes while borrowings under the credit facility are outstanding 
the credit facility also requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and meet other financial tests 
the failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could require us to repay these borrowings before their scheduled due date 
if we were unable to make this repayment or otherwise refinance these borrowings  the lenders under the credit facility could foreclose on our assets 
in addition  these lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed under the credit facility  together with accrued interest  to be due and payable  which  in some instances  would be an event of default under the indentures governing the notes 
if we were unable to refinance these borrowings on favorable terms  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by increased costs and less favorable terms  including rates and covenants 
any future refinancing of the credit facility is likely to contain similar restrictive covenants 
furthermore  the terms of the purchase agreement with respect to our preferred stock  among other things  restricts our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt  pay dividends on shares of our common stock or repurchase shares of our common stock  enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates  and sell or acquire certain assets 
our failure to comply with these terms would result in a breach of this agreement  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  without the consent of the gs funds  we cannot issue shares of common stock for months following the sale of the preferred stock  which could adversely affect our liquidity see liquidity and capital resources for a description of the preferred stock 
declining usage of print yellow pages directories and changes in technology since  overall usage of printed yellow pages directories in the united states has declined 
we cannot assure you that usage of our yellow pages directories will remain stable and not decline 
we believe that declines in usage of printed directories are in part a result of increased usage of internet based directory products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to provide services over the internet successfully or that we will be able to compete successfully with other internet based directory services 
any declines in usage could impair our ability to maintain or increase advertising prices  cause businesses that purchase advertising in our yellow pages directories to reduce or discontinue those purchases and discourage businesses that do not purchase advertising in our yellow pages directories from doing so 
any of the factors that may contribute to a decline in usage of our printed directories  or a combination of them  could impair our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents the yellow pages directory advertising business is subject to changes arising from developments in technology  including information distribution methods and users technological preferences 
the use of the internet by consumers as a means to transact commerce may result in new technologies being developed and services being provided that could compete with our products and services 
as a result of these factors  our growth and future financial performance may depend on our ability to develop and market new products and services and create new distribution channels  while enhancing existing products  services and distribution channels  in order to incorporate the latest technological advances and accommodate changing user preferences  including the use of the internet 
if we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and user preferences or are unable to finance the capital expenditures necessary to respond to such changes  our results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
sbc s or dontech s actions could adversely impact our business dontech is our perpetual partnership with an affiliate of sbc communications inc sbc 
as the exclusive sales agent for sbc directories in illinois and northwest indiana  dontech is responsible for the management of its sales forces  including compensation  recruiting and training and other sales related matters 
as the publisher  sbc has responsibility for and control over all other matters  including  without limitation  product development  pricing  scheduling  marketing  distribution  billing  collections  credit and customer service 
while we believe that dontech and its economic interests are generally aligned with those of sbc with respect to sbc s yellow pages directory operations  sbc could implement policies and decisions in which dontech or we would likely have little or no participation or influence and or perform its obligations in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and  potentially  on our relationship with sbc 
we cannot assure you that any such policies or decisions would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or our relationship with sbc 
we also maintain a large receivable balance from sbc and any liquidity difficulties that sbc may experience could materially impact our results of operations or financial condition 
the dontech partnership agreement and related sbc contractual arrangements have perpetual terms 
these arrangements only terminate upon the occurrence of certain enumerated events  including  without limitation  the unremedied breaches of certain material provisions thereof  the mutual agreement of the parties  the bankruptcy of a partner or parent or a change in control of a partner excluding a change in control of the ultimate parent company of the partner 
in addition  under applicable law  the contractual arrangements potentially may not remain in effect in perpetuity 
we cannot assure you that the dontech relationship will remain in full force and effect into perpetuity  without material modification or at all  that dontech and sbc will perform all of their respective material obligations particularly payment obligations under these agreements or that sbc will not seek to terminate these arrangements 
in the event any such party seeks to terminate these contractual arrangements  the other party may dispute such attempted termination and  in such case  a court or arbitrator may be required to determine the appropriateness of any such attempted termination 
we cannot assure you as to the outcome of any such proceeding 
any such termination or material modification of the agreements or failure by sbc or dontech to perform their respective material obligations would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
competition the us directory advertising industry is highly competitive 
more than independent publishers operating in the united states compete with regional bell operating company rboc directory publishers and other telephone utility publishers 
in most markets  we compete with one or more yellow pages directory publishers  which are predominantly independent publishers 
in some markets  we compete on a limited basis with rboc directory publishers in adjacent markets 
one of these publishers  verizon information services  the directory business affiliated with verizon communications  inc  has announced plans to publish directories and offer local internet directory services in markets beyond where verizon communications offers local phone service  including in several spa markets 
effectively  verizon information services will be competing as an independent publisher in those markets 
while no other rboc or utility publisher has announced similar plans  we cannot assure you that other rboc or utility publishers will not do so in the future 
many of the parent companies of these telephone utility publishers are larger than us and have greater financial resources than we have 
no assurances can be given that we will be able to compete effectively with these other publishers for advertising sales or acquisitions in the future 

table of contents we also compete for advertising sales with other media  including newspapers  magazines  radio  direct mail  the internet and television 
many of these competitors are larger than us and have greater financial resources than we have 
additionally  advances in technology have brought new participants  new products and new channels to the industry  including increasing use of electronic delivery of directory information as an advertising medium 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete in responding to any such developments 
in addition  the telecommunications act of  which effectively opened local telephone markets to increased competition  may adversely impact the market position of telephone utilities  including those with which we have relationships 
because the telecommunications act of has opened local telephone markets to increased competition  we cannot assure you that sprint  or sbc will remain a dominant local telephone service provider in its local service areas 
if sprint were no longer a dominant local telephone service provider in any particular local service area  our license to be the exclusive publisher for sprint in its markets and to use the sprint brand name on our directories in those markets may not be as valuable as we presently anticipate  and we may not realize some of the anticipated benefits under our commercial arrangements with sprint and its affiliates 
if sbc was no longer a dominant local telephone service provider in any dontech service area  the financial results we recognize from dontech could be adversely affected 
our ability to successfully integrate spa into our operations the integration of spa into our operations involves a number of risks  including difficulty integrating operations and personnel at different locations  diversion of management attention  potential disruption of ongoing business because of the unknown reactions to the combination of spa and us by vendors  customers and other key constituencies  difficulties in assimilating the technologies  services and products of spa  inability to retain key personnel  inability to successfully incorporate acquired business components with our existing infrastructure  and inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies 
if we are unable to effectively integrate operations and personnel in a timely and efficient manner  we may not realize the benefits expected from the acquisition 
failure to overcome these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with the acquisition could slow our growth or lower our quality of services  which could reduce customer demand 
reliance on  and extension of credit to  small and medium sized businesses a significant portion of our revenue is derived from selling advertising to small and medium sized businesses 
in the ordinary course of our yellow pages publishing business  we extend credit to these advertisers for advertising purchases 
small and medium sized businesses  however  tend to have fewer financial resources and higher financial failure rates than large businesses 
in addition  collection procedures for delinquent accounts can take an extended period of time and involve increased costs 
consequently  we could be adversely affected by our dependence on and our extension of credit to small and medium sized businesses 
dependence on third party providers of printing  distribution and delivery services we depend on third parties for the printing and distribution of our directories 
we currently have two contracts for the printing of our directories with rr donnelley sons rr donnelley 
although these contracts do not expire until december and december  because of the large print volume and specialized binding of directories  there are a limited number of companies capable of servicing our printing needs 
accordingly  the inability or unwillingness of rr donnelley to provide printing services to us on acceptable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business 
no common ownership or other business affiliation exists between rr donnelley and us 
we also have contracts for the delivery of our directories to the individual households and businesses in the geographic area covered by the directories 
these contracts are scheduled to expire in february and may be terminated by our vendors upon days written notice 
there are a limited number of companies capable of 
table of contents servicing our delivery needs 
accordingly  the inability or unwillingness of our current vendors to provide delivery services to us on acceptable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business 
general economic factors our business results could be adversely affected by a prolonged national or regional economic recession 
typically  our advertising revenues  as well as those of yellow pages publishers in general  do not fluctuate widely with economic cycles 
however  such a prolonged national or regional economic recession could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  any residual economic effects of  and uncertainties regarding i the terrorist attacks that occurred on september   ii the general possibility  express threat or future occurrence of similar terrorist or other related disruptive events  or iii the threat of or the united states involvement in war  especially with respect to the major markets in which we operate that depend heavily upon travel  tourism or the military  could also adversely affect our business 
fluctuations in the price and availability of paper after the acquisition  our principal raw material is paper  which our printer currently purchases on our behalf at agreed upon prices 
these prices are at or near the spot market price  as we do not currently have long term purchase arrangements or commitments from paper mills or other outside suppliers 
accordingly  we are subject to price increases and delays in receiving this principal raw material 
further  changes in the supply of  or demand for  paper could affect delivery times and prices 
as conditions warrant  we may enter into longer term supply agreements in the future 
paper is one of our largest variable cost items and will account for approximately to of annual operating expenses 
we cannot assure you that we will have available necessary raw materials at reasonable prices or that any increases in paper costs would not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the sale of advertising to national accounts is coordinated by third parties that we do not control we expect that approximately of our revenues in will be derived from the sale of advertising to national or large regional companies  such as rental car companies  automobile repair shops and pizza delivery businesses  that purchase advertising in several of our directories 
in order to sell advertising to these accounts  we contract with cmrs  who are independent third parties that act as agents for national companies and design their advertisements  arrange for the placement of those advertisements in directories and provide billing services 
as a result  our relationships with these national advertisers depend significantly on the performance of these third party cmrs whom we do not control 
although we believe that relationships with these cmrs have been mutually beneficial  if some or all of the cmrs with whom we have established relationships were unable or unwilling to provide services to us on acceptable terms or at all  such inability or unwillingness could materially adversely affect our business 
turnover among our sales force or key management our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to identify  hire  train and retain qualified sales personnel in each of the markets in which we operate 
we expend a significant amount of resources and management time on identifying and training our sales representatives 
our ability to attract and retain qualified sales personnel depends on numerous factors  including factors outside of our control  such as conditions in the local employment markets in which we operate 
a decrease in the number of sales representatives could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity  as well as our ability to service our debt 
furthermore  we depend on the continued services of key personnel  including our experienced senior management team as well as our regional sales management personnel 
although we believe that we could replace our senior management team and other key employees within a reasonable time period should the need arise  the loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the loss of important intellectual property rights 
some of our trademarks such as the sprint and donnelley brand names and other intellectual property rights are important to our business 
we rely upon a combination of copyright and trademark laws as well as contractual arrangements  including licensing agreements  particularly with respect to sprint markets  to establish and protect our intellectual property rights 
we are required from time to time to bring lawsuits against third parties in order to protect our intellectual property rights 
similarly  we are  and from time to time expect to be  party to proceedings where third parties challenge our rights 
we cannot be sure that any lawsuits or other actions brought by us will be 
table of contents successful or that we will not be found to infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 
although we are not aware of any material infringements of any trademark rights that are significant to our business  any lawsuits  regardless of their outcome  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  we only have rights to use the sprint name and diamond logo in certain markets 
the loss of important intellectual property rights such as trademarks could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
impact of bankruptcy proceedings against sprint during the term of the spa commercial arrangements contract rights under the directory services license agreement  trademark license agreement and non competition agreement with sprint constitute a substantial portion of our commercial arrangements with sprint 
pursuant to these commercial arrangements  we are the exclusive directory publisher for sprint in the markets in which sprint currently provides telephone service and  under certain circumstances  in markets that are acquired by sprint in the future 
if a bankruptcy case were to be commenced by or against sprint  it is possible that all or part of the directory services license agreement and or non competition agreement could be considered an executory contract and could therefore be subject to rejection by sprint or a trustee appointed in a bankruptcy case pursuant to section or section of the united states bankruptcy code 
if one or more of these agreements were rejected  the applicable agreement may not be specifically enforceable  in which case we would have only an unsecured claim for damages against sprint for the breach of contract resulting from the rejection 
if the directory services license agreement were rejected  we would  among other things  no longer be entitled to be sprint s exclusive publisher of telephone directories in the affected markets 
we could also lose our right to enforce the provisions of the agreement under which we have the right to license trademarks of successor local exchange carriers in the sprint markets 
if the non competition agreement was rejected and specific enforcement was not available  sprint would  among other things  no longer be precluded from publishing print telephone directories or selling local directory advertising in the applicable restricted markets 
sprint has created a bankruptcy remote special purpose vehicle in the form of a limited liability company and contributed and assigned the trademarks being licensed to us under the trademark license agreement to this limited liability company 
the operating agreements of this limited liability company require  among other things  that the board of managers of this entity include one independent manager that is unaffiliated with sprint 
the consent of this independent manager is required for the entity to take certain actions  including  among other things  commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding 
because the trademarks were contributed to this limited liability company  our rights under the trademark license agreement are not subject to rejection in the event of a bankruptcy proceeding involving sprint unless there is also a bankruptcy proceeding involving this limited liability company 
although we believe that the likelihood of this entity being the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding is limited by this structure and the governing provisions of the operating agreement  if the trademark license agreement were rejected in a bankruptcy proceeding  we would lose the right to use the sprint brand name for the spa directories 
we cannot assure you that any loss of rights under certain of these arrangements with sprint would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our ability to enforce the non competition agreement with sprint sprint has agreed  in general  not to publish print telephone directories or sell local advertising for use in directories in the acquired markets during the term of the non competition agreement 
however  under state and federal law  a covenant not to compete is only enforceable to the extent it is necessary to protect a legitimate business interest of the party seeking enforcement  if it does not unreasonably restrain the party against whom enforcement is sought  and if it is not contrary to the public interest 
enforceability of a non competition covenant is determined by a court based on all of the facts and circumstances of the specific case at the time enforcement is sought 
for this reason  it is not possible for us to predict whether  or to what extent  a court will enforce sprint s covenants not to compete against us during the term of the non competition agreement 
if a court were to determine that the non competition agreement is unenforceable  sprint could compete directly against us in the directory publishing business in the previously restricted markets 
we cannot assure you that our inability to enforce the non competition agreement with sprint would not have a material adverse effect on 
table of contents our financial condition or results of operations 
significant business development on january   we completed the acquisition of spa for  million in cash  after a preliminary working capital adjustment 
the purchase price is subject to a final working capital adjustment 
spa is the publisher of revenue generating yellow pages directories in states 
prior to this acquisition  we acted as a sales agent and pre press publishing vendor for spa for of these directories in states 
the acquisition transforms the company from a sales agent and pre press vendor into a leading publisher of yellow pages directories 
to finance the acquisition  we entered into a new  million credit facility  consisting of a million term loan a  a million term loan b and a million revolver 
we also issued million notes and million notes 
finally  the gs funds purchased million of preferred stock 
to take advantage of favorable market conditions and to ensure the timely consummation of the spa acquisition  we issued the notes and borrowed the term loan b in december the total gross proceeds of  million were deposited and held in escrow pending the spa acquisition closing 
the gs funds also invested an initial million through the purchase of  shares of preferred stock 
this investment was a portion of their million commitment 
at the closing of the spa acquisition  the gs funds purchased the remaining million of preferred stock and we borrowed the term loan a and million under the revolver 
in connection with the transaction  we entered into a directory services license agreement  a trademark license agreement and a non competition agreement with sprint 
the directory services license agreement gives us the exclusive right to produce  publish and distribute directories for sprint in the markets where sprint currently provides local telephone service 
the trademark license agreement gives us the exclusive right to use certain sprint trademarks  including the sprint diamond logo  in those markets 
the non competition agreement prohibits sprint from producing  publishing and distributing print directories or selling local advertising in those markets  with certain limited exceptions 
these agreements are all interrelated and each has initial terms of years  subject to earlier termination under specified circumstances 
prior to the acquisition  we provided sales agency and pre press publishing services to spa 
accordingly  at december   we had an aggregate receivable of million for commissions  pre press publishing fees and priority distribution income from spa 
as a result of the acquisition  these receivables became intercompany items and were included as part of the purchase price 
also  long term liabilities at december  include an amount due to sprint of million  which we paid in cash at the closing 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase business combination and the purchase price was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values on the acquisition date 
the results of the spa business will be included in our consolidated results from and after january   the acquisition closing date 
accordingly  the results of spa are not included in our audited financial statements at or for the year ended december  
table of contents the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is shown in the table below 
the purchase price allocation is preliminary and based on the best information currently available and could change as additional information arises

our business was organized into two reportable operating segments the dontech partnership and directory advertising services 
dontech dontech is a perpetual partnership with an operating unit of sbc 
dontech acts as the exclusive sales agent for yellow pages directories published by sbc in illinois and northwest indiana and receives a commission from sbc 
income from dontech is comprised of our interest in the net profits of dontech and revenue participation income received directly from an affiliate of sbc 
revenue participation income is based on a percentage of dontech advertising sales and comprises approximately to of the total annual income related to dontech 
total income from dontech accounted for  and of operating income before general corporate costs and other unallocated expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively 
certain general and administrative expenses incurred to support this business are not allocated to the dontech segment 
as income from dontech accounts for a significant portion of our operating income  a material decline in the advertising sales of dontech would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we also provide certain pre press publishing services for those sbc directories for which dontech sells advertising  the income from which was included in our das segment as described below 
although dontech provides advertising sales of yellow pages and other directory products similar to das  the partnership is considered a separate operating segment since  among other things  the partnership has its own board of directors and the employees of dontech  including its officers and managers  are not our employees 
following the spa transaction  dontech continues to act as a sales agent for sbc and earn commissions when an advertising contract is signed 
further  we will continue to account for dontech under the equity method of accounting 

table of contents historical directory advertising services within our das segment  we sold yellow pages advertising for affiliated entities of sprint and performed pre press publishing services for yellow pages directories 
we were the exclusive sales agent in the greater orlando  florida market central florida for an operating unit of sprint and the exclusive sales agent in nevada  florida  virginia and north carolina for cendon llc cendon  a joint venture with centel directory company centel  a subsidiary of sprint 
other sprint affiliates sold yellow pages advertising in other markets in these states 
we received sales commissions on all advertising sold for sprint and cendon and a priority distribution on our membership interest in cendon 
the amount of priority distribution earned was based on a percentage of cendon advertising sales 
prior to the acquisition  a material decline in advertising sales in these markets could have had a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the das segment also included pre press publishing services provided to sbc and sprint for their respective yellow pages directories for which we sold advertising under separately negotiated contracts 
the agreement with sbc extends through the agreement with sprint was scheduled to expire in we also provided pre press publishing services to an unaffiliated third party under an agreement that expired at the end of we have jointly agreed to an orderly transition of work that will take place during the first quarter of revenue from our pre press publishing services operation accounted for approximately  and of total consolidated revenue in  and  respectively 
however  going forward  revenue from pre press publishing services will account for a significantly lower percentage of total revenue as consolidated revenues will be considerably higher 
das also included all information technology costs 
the results of the das segment for included the operating results of the cincinnati proprietary directory business  the bell atlantic sales agency business  the get digital smart internet business and equity losses of chinabig 
com limited chinabig through the dates of transactions that caused changes in the reporting of each respective business 
the results of das also include a one time operating income benefit of million from the restructuring and extension of the cendon partnership 
see factors affecting comparability below for more information 
critical accounting policies certain amounts in our financial statements require that management make assumptions and estimates based on the best available information at that time 
actual results could vary from these estimates and assumptions 
those accounting policies that involve assumptions or estimates on our part that could have a material effect on results of operations or financial condition if the actual results differ from the assumptions or estimates are presented below 
for additional information on our accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item principles of consolidation 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of rh donnelley corporation and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated 
dontech is accounted for under the equity method as we do not have control  but do have the ability to exercise significant influence over its operating and financial policies 
accordingly  the results of dontech are not consolidated in our financial statements  but our share of its net profits is reported as partnership and joint venture income in our consolidated statements of operations 
revenue recognition 
during the three years ended december   we earned sales commission revenue from the sale of advertising on behalf of sprint and fees for pre press publishing services 
as a sales agent for sprint  we recognized sales commission revenue at the time an advertising contract was executed with a customer 
sales commission revenue was recorded net of potential sales allowances  which were estimated  based on historical experience 
if an advertiser was not satisfied with its yellow pages advertisement eg misspelled business name  incorrect business address or number  etc  the publisher had discretion to adjust the contract value 
since commissions were earned based on the aggregate value of advertising contracts  our commissions would have also been adjusted under those circumstances 
concurrent with the recognition of sales commission revenue  we recorded a sales allowance of approximately of sales commission revenue  based on historical experience 
the amount of sales allowance recorded was subsequently adjusted based on actual results 
historically  the actual amount of sales allowances was consistent with our estimates and significant adjustments were not made 
revenue from pre press publishing operations was recognized as services were performed 
we recognized no allowances for

as a result of the acquisition  we will recognize revenue from the sale of directory advertising in sprint yellow pages directories and certain related direct costs under the deferral and amortization method  whereby revenues and direct costs are recognized ratably over the life of a directory  which is typically twelve months 
revenue recognition for pre press publishing services remains unchanged 
trade receivables 
trade receivables represented sales commissions earned from the sale of advertising on behalf of sprint and fees earned for pre press publishing services 
we established an allowance for doubtful accounts for sales commissions based upon historical experience and contractual limitations 
the sales agency agreement between centel and us limited our exposure to bad debts at a specified percentage of sales 
actual bad debts for cendon directories over the last three years exceeded our maximum contractual exposure 
accordingly  an increase in the actual bad debt rate would not have directly impacted our results of operations or financial condition 
under the central florida sales agency agreement  our exposure to bad debts was not contractually limited 
we estimated our bad debt expense based on historical experience and made subsequent adjustments  if necessary  based on actual results 
receivables for sales commissions were billed to the publisher upon directory publication and collected in accordance with contractual provisions  typically in the same month of publication  but no later than nine months after publication 
receivables for pre press publishing services were billed and collected in accordance with the terms of the applicable agreement  generally a monthly pro rata amount based on the annual contract value 
if actual volumes exceeded contracted volumes  an additional amount is billed to the publisher at year end 
although we will no longer bill sprint for these services  we will continue to bill and collect from sbc through the end of the contract in after the acquisition  our receivables from advertising sales in sprint yellow pages directories represent the full contract value of the advertisement as opposed to a commission on the contract value 
rather than spa being our trade debtor  we have assumed a direct billing relationship with directory advertisers 
we bill most local advertisers on a monthly basis over the life of a directory 
see concentration of credit risk below and forward looking information reliance on  and extension of credit to  small and medium sized businesses 
sbc remains our trade debtor with respect to the sale of advertising in dontech markets 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
pension and other postretirement benefits represent estimated amounts to be paid to employees in the future 
the accounting for benefits reflects the recognition of these benefit costs over the employees approximate service period based on the terms of the plan and the investment and funding decisions made 
the determination of the benefit obligations and the net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs requires management to make assumptions regarding the discount rate  return on retirement plan assets  increase in future compensation and health care cost trends 
changes in these assumptions can have a significant impact on the projected benefit obligation  funding requirement and net periodic benefit cost 
the assumed discount rate is the rate at which the pension benefits could be settled 
we use the rates on aa corporate bonds as a basis for determining our discount rate assumption 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on the mix of assets held by the plan and the expected long term rates of return within each asset class 
the anticipated trend of future health care costs is based on historical experience and external factors 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for further information regarding our benefit plans 
effective january   we reduced our rate of return on plan assets from to 
as a result of low investment returns over the last few years  as well as our outlook for the long term  particularly for equity securities  we determined that the assumed rate of return of no longer reflected our best estimate of future long term returns 
based on the current investment environment and the pension plan s asset allocation  we determined that a long term rate of return of better reflected our expectations for future long term returns 
for the year ended december   pension income was million 
had our assumed rate of return on plan assets been at the beginning of  pension income would have been approximately million 
we estimate that pension expense will be approximately million in earnings per share 
basic earnings per common share eps are generally calculated by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding 
however  because the preferred stock contains certain participation rights  eitf topic d  effect of participating securities on the computation of basic earnings per share  topic d requires that the dilutive effect of those securities be 
table of contents included in the weighted average number of shares outstanding 
furthermore  topic d requires that the dilutive effect to be included in basic eps may be calculated using either the if converted method or the two class method 
however  the dilutive effect of the preferred stock cannot be less than that which would result from the application of the two class method 
we have elected to use the if converted method in calculating basic eps 
diluted eps are calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average common shares outstanding plus common share equivalents 
common share equivalents include stock options and warrants  the dilutive effect of which is calculated using the treasury stock method  and preferred stock  the potential dilutive effect of which is calculated using the if converted method 
concentration of credit risk 
we maintain a significant receivable balance from sbc for revenue participation income and pre press publishing services 
the revenue participation receivable is subject to adjustment  based on collections by sbc from individual advertisers  however  the adjustment is limited based on contractual provisions 
the receivables for revenue participation and pre press publishing services are recorded at net realizable value 
we do not foresee a material credit risk associated with the collection of these receivables  although we can give no assurance that full payment will continue to be received on a timely basis 
at december   we also had aggregate receivables from spa for commissions  pre press publishing fees and priority distribution income of million 
as a result of the acquisition  these receivables became intercompany items 
after the acquisition  a significant portion of our net revenue is derived from selling advertising to local small and medium sized businesses 
these advertisers enter into twelve month advertising sales contracts and typically make monthly payments over the term of the contract 
some advertisers pre pay the full amount or a portion of the contract value 
most advertisers  including all new advertisers  are subject to a credit review  and if the advertiser qualifies  we extend credit to them for their advertising purchase 
small and medium sized businesses tend to have fewer financial resources and higher financial failure rates than large businesses 
in addition  full collection of delinquent accounts can take an extended period of time and involve increased costs 
while we do not believe that extending credit to our local advertisers will have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition  no assurances can be given 
we do not require collateral from our advertisers  although we do charge interest to advertisers who do not pay within specified due dates 
national advertising is typically paid in full within days of directory publication by the associated cmr 
employee stock options 
we follow accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations apb in accounting for our stock option plan  and  accordingly  no compensation expense related to the issuance of stock options to employees or non employee directors has been recognized in the three years ended december  we also grant stock options to certain key employees of dontech 
because dontech employees are not our employees  current accounting rules require that we recognize compensation expense over the vesting period based on the fair value of the options 
we recognized compensation expense of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  options to purchase  shares of our common stock founders grant were granted to certain employees contingent on the consummation of the spa acquisition 
under apb  we will recognize expense of million over the next four years

in addition  the statement amends the disclosure requirements of fas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect on reported results 
the statement is effective for calendar year  however  at this time  we do not intend to voluntarily adopt the provisions of fas new accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued fas  rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
this statement  among other things  changes the way gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt are reported 
previously  all gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt were required to be reported as an extraordinary item  net of related tax effect 
under fas  gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt should be reported as part of on going operations  unless the extinguishment of debt is both an unusual and infrequent event for the entity 
previously reported extraordinary gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt that are not unusual or infrequent should be reclassified 
this statement is effective for calendar year  however  as permitted  we adopted this statement at the end of previously reported extraordinary losses from the extinguishment of debt have been reclassified 
accordingly  interest expense includes the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the prepayment of debt of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the adoption of this statement did not impact previously reported net income

fas addresses the accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
this statement is effective for transactions initiated after december  and is to be applied prospectively 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of the guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the recognition and measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements for periods ending after december  we do not guarantee any obligations of third parties including dontech  however its indirect subsidiaries jointly and severally  fully and
