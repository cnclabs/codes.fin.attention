the loss of a significant customer could have an adverse effect on our business 
we face significant competition in the marketing and sales of our products 
our products compete for consumer recognition and shelf space with candies  cakes  cookies  chocolates and other food products which have achieved international  national  regional and local brand recognition and consumer loyalty 
these products are marketed by companies which may include our suppliers with significantly greater financial  manufacturing  marketing  distribution  personnel and other resources than we have 
some of these competitors  such as hershey food corporation  masterfoods usa m m mars  inc  nestle  sa  and kraft foods  dominate the markets for candy and cookie products  and have substantial promotional budgets which enable them to implement extensive advertising campaigns 
the food industry is characterized by frequent introductions of new products  accompanied by substantial promotional campaigns 
if we are unable to continue to compete successfully our business could be adversely affected 
we face various risks relating to a recent acquisition 
we recently acquired the business of asher candy acquisition corporation 
asher candy acquisition corporation manufactured candy canes  a product which we had no prior experience in manufacturing 
if we are unable to successfully produce a quality product  and maintain or increase the customer base  our profitability could be adversely affected 
our success is highly dependent on consumer preferences and industry factors 
the markets for candy and cookie products are affected by changes in consumer tastes and preferences and nutritional and health related concerns 
we could be subject to increased competition from companies whose products or marketing strategies address these concerns 
in addition  the markets for our products may be subject to national  regional and local economic conditions which affect discretionary spending  demographic trends and product life cycles  whereby product sales increase from their introductory stage through their maturity and then reach a stage of decline over time 
we have limited historical profitability and may not be profitable in the future 
we have historically  until recently  achieved limited profitability 
our operating expenses have increased and can be expected to continue to increase in connection with any expansion activities undertaken by us  including those relating to advertising and product manufacturing

our failure to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights could negatively impact the value of our brand names 
we are requested some of our marks in countries other than the us and may apply for additional registration as appropriate 
we are dependent on third party manufacturers and suppliers

in addition  raw materials necessary for the manufacture of our products at our facilities  including flour  sugar  shortening  butter and flavorings  are purchased from third party suppliers 
we do not maintain agreements with any such suppliers and we are  therefore  subject to risks of periodic price fluctuations  shortages and delays

we assume the risk of loss  damage or destruction of products when shipped by a manufacturer 
because we pay for some of our products manufactured outside the united states in foreign currencies  any weakening of the united states dollar in relation to relevant foreign currencies  could result in significantly increased costs to us 
in addition  some products manufactured overseas are subject to import duties 
deliveries of products from our foreign manufacturers could also be delayed or restricted by the future imposition of quotas

overview the company is engaged in the manufacture  marketing and distribution of a diverse line of brand name candies  cookies  chocolates and gifts 
through fiscal year ended july   the company had experienced continued revenue growth 
this growth was a direct result of the company s introduction of gift items  gift baskets and new candy products 
the new gift products enabled the company to expand its customer base to include mass merchandisers 
with net sales growing from approximately million in fiscal to over million in fiscal  management began to take steps to reduce costs in future years by consolidating operations and continuing to build its infrastructure 
the objectives are to establish new production and assembly facilities with more efficient and effective cost structures 
the company began implementing these plans during the year ended july  over the past two fiscal years ended july  and  the company had seen declines in its net sales largely attributable to decreased consumer confidence and spending and the weak environment 
the following highlights the attributing factors for the declines for fiscal year ended july  jelly pricing not meeting company s profitability levels  declined orders of million

major chains that ordered products delaying their shipments 
the company held onto  of inventory for these major chains for over twelve months

the chase city manufacturing facility inefficiencies and capacity levels running at on a daily basis 
the impact of this transition resulted in approximately million of pre production start up costs  or of net sales and resulted in a write down of obsolete film and packaging inventory of approximately million or of net sales 
the inventory write down was a direct result of our decision in the third quarter ending april  to shift certain production to our overseas third party manufacturing suppliers 
we have reduced our work force from employees to at the chase city facility  and are currently in the process of moving hard and soft candy production to our third party manufacturing suppliers overseas 
we anticipate that additional expenses may arise due to movement from chase city to our overseas suppliers 
on september   west coast ports were shut down abruptly and remained closed as contract negotiations between dock workers and shipping companies broke off negotiations for new contracts 
the shut down occurred during the company s peak inventory shipping period for orders for the holiday season 
the shut down had an effect on our first quarter of shipments to our customers 
a large portion of containers  which were to be received  remained either at ports or on shipping vessels on the water 
in addition  empty containers were not brought back to ports in the pacific rim  which we needed to move some of our other products 
a slow down by the long shore men on shipping products was still prevalent 
our first quarter revenues were impacted by the shut down and resulted in a delay of approximately million in sales
