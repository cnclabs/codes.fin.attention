item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since our founding in  we have developed and marketed software and services to companies in the process industries 
in addition to internally generated growth  we have acquired a number of businesses  including hyprotech on may  we acquired hyprotech in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
our operating results include the operating results of hyprotech only for periods subsequent to the date of acquisition 
we typically license our engineering solutions for terms of three to five years and license our manufacturing supply chain solutions for terms of years 
see item business products software and services 
software license revenues  including license renewals  consists principally of revenues earned under fixed term and perpetual software license agreements and is generally recognized upon shipment of the software if collection of the resulting receivable is probable  the fee is fixed or determinable  and vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value exists for all undelivered elements 
we determine vsoe based upon the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
maintenance and support vsoe represents a consistent percentage of the license fees charged to customers 
consulting services vsoe represents standard rates  which we charge our customers when we sell our consulting services separately 
for an element not yet being sold separately  vsoe represents the price established by management having the relevant authority when it is probable that the price  once established  will not change before the separate introduction of the element into the marketplace 
revenues under license arrangements  which may include several different software products and services sold together  are allocated to each element based on the residual method in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and subsequently recognized when earned 
we have established sufficient vsoe for professional services  training and maintenance and support services 
accordingly  software license revenues are recognized under the residual method in arrangements in which software is licensed with professional services  training and maintenance and support services 
we use installment contracts as a standard business practice and have a history of successfully collecting under the original payment terms without making concessions on payments  products or services 
maintenance and support services revenues are recognized ratably over the life of the maintenance and support contract period 
maintenance and support services include telephone support and unspecified rights to product upgrades and enhancements 
these services are typically sold for a one year term and are sold either as part of a multiple element arrangement with software licenses or are sold independently at time of renewal 
we do not provide specified upgrades to our customers in connection with the licensing of our software products 
service revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized using the proportional performance method  measured by the percentage of costs primarily labor incurred to date as compared to the estimated total costs primarily labor for each contract 
when a loss is anticipated on a contract  the full amount thereof is provided currently 
service revenues from time and expense contracts and consulting and training revenues are recognized as the related services are performed 
services that have been performed but for which billings have not been made are recorded as unbilled services  and billings that have been recorded before the services have been performed are recorded as unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in accordance with the emerging issues task force released issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  reimbursement received for out of pocket expenses is recorded as revenue and not as a reduction of expenses 
we license our software in us dollars and several foreign currencies 
we hedge material foreign currency denominated installments receivable with specific hedge contracts in amounts equal to those installments receivable 
historically  we experience minor foreign currency exchange gains or losses due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  the impact of which have typically not been material 
we do not expect fluctuations in foreign currencies to have a significant impact on either our revenues or our expenses in the foreseeable future 
significant events year ended june  the restructuring and other charges  totaling million in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations  consist of million of charges associated with our october restructuring plan as described below  and million of accrued legal costs  related to the ftc challenge of our acquisition of hyprotech as described below 
in october  we determined that the goodwill should be tested for impairment as a result of lowered revenue expectations and the overall decline in our market value 
an independent third party valued our three business reporting units  license  consulting services  and maintenance and training 
the valuation was based on an income approach  using a five year present value calculation of income  and a market approach  using comparable company valuations 
based on this analysis  it was determined that the full values of the goodwill associated with the license unit and consulting services unit were impaired 
it was also determined that the fair value of the maintenance and training reporting unit exceeded its carrying value  resulting in no impairment of its goodwill 
this amounted to a million aggregate impairment charge  recorded in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
on august   the ftc announced that it has authorized its staff to file a civil administrative complaint alleging that our acquisition of hyprotech in may was anticompetitive and seeking to declare the acquisition in violation of section of the ftc act and section of the clayton act 
it is too early to determine the likely outcome of the ftc s challenge 
because of the length of the appeals process  the outcome of this matter may not be determined for several years 
if the ftc were to prevail in this challenge  it could seek to impose a wide variety of remedies  some of which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate under our current business plans and on our results of operations 
these potential remedies include divestiture of hyprotech  as well as mandatory licensing of hyprotech software products and our other engineering software products to one or more of our competitors 
as of june   we had accrued million to cover the cost of professional service fees associated with our cooperation in the ftc s investigation since its commencement on june   and estimated future professional services fees relating to the initial administrative proceeding and any subsequent appeals 
in january  we executed a loan arrangement with silicon valley bank 
this arrangement provides a line of credit of up to the lesser of i million or ii of eligible domestic receivables  and a line of credit of up to the lesser of i million or ii of eligible foreign receivables 
the lines of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate at june  plus  which may be reduced to the bank s prime rate upon the achievement of two consecutive quarters of net income 
we are required to maintain a million compensating cash balance with the bank  or be subject to an unused line fee and collateral handling fees 
the lines of credit will initially be collateralized by nearly all of our assets  and upon achieving certain net income targets  the collateral will be reduced to a lien on the accounts receivable 
we are required to meet certain financial covenants  including minimum tangible net worth  minimum cash balances and an adjusted quick ratio 
in august  we executed an amendment to the loan arrangement that adjusted the terms of certain financial covenants  and cured a default of the tangible net worth covenant as of june  the loan arrangement expires in january summary of restructuring accruals fiscal in october  we initiated a plan to further reduce operating expenses in response to first quarter revenue results that were below our expectations and to general economic uncertainties 
in addition  we revised our revenue expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year and beyond  primarily related to our manufacturing supply chain product line  which has been affected the most by the current economic conditions 
the plan to reduce operating expenses resulted in headcount reductions  consolidation of facilities  cancellation of certain internal capital projects and discontinuation of development and support for certain non critical products 
as a result of the discontinuation of development and support for certain products  coupled with the revised revenue expectations  certain long lived assets were reviewed and determined to be impaired in accordance with sfas no 
these actions resulted in an aggregate restructuring charge of million 
in june  we reviewed our estimates to this plan and recorded a million increase to the accrual  primarily due to revisions of the facility sub leasing assumptions  as well as increases to severance and other costs 
as of june   there was million remaining in accrued expenses relating to the remaining severance obligations and lease payments 
during the year ended june   the following activity was recorded in thousands closure consolidation of facilities employee severance  benefits  and related costs impairment of assets and disposition costs total restructuring charge     write off impairment of assets   payments    accrued expenses  june      we expect that the remaining obligations will be paid by december fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we initiated a plan to reduce operating expenses and to restructure operations around our two primary product lines  engineering software and manufacturing supply chain software 
we reduced worldwide headcount by approximately or employees  closed and consolidated facilities  and disposed of certain assets  resulting in an aggregate restructuring charge of million 
as of june   there was million remaining in accrued expenses relating to the remaining severance obligations and lease payments 
during the year ended june   the following activity was recorded closure consolidation of facilities employee severance  benefits  and related costs total accrued expenses  june     payments   accrued expenses  june     we expect that the remaining obligations will be paid by december during the first quarter of fiscal  in light of further economic uncertainties  our management made a decision to adjust our business plan by further reducing spending 
this change in business plan consisted of a reduction in worldwide headcount of approximately of the workforce and a reduction of certain future discretionary expenses 
as a result of these measures  we recorded a restructuring charge of million  primarily for severance  for the quarter ended september  during the year ended june   the following activity was recorded closure consolidation of facilities employee severance  benefits  and related costs total accrued expenses  june  payments accrued expenses  june  fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal  the revenues realized were below expectations as customers delayed spending in the widespread slowdown in information technology spending and the deferral of late quarter purchasing decisions 
at that time  we also reduced our revenue expectations for the fourth quarter of fiscal year and for the fiscal year based on the reduced revenue expectations  management evaluated the business plan and made significant changes  resulting in a restructuring plan for our operations 
this restructuring plan included a reduction in headcount  a substantial decrease in discretionary spending and a sharpening of our e business focus to emphasize our marketplace solutions 
the restructuring plan resulted in a pretax charge totaling million 
as of june   there was million remaining in accrued expenses relating to the restructuring 
during the year ended june   the following activity was recorded closure consolidation of facilities employee severance  benefits  and related costs total accrued expenses  june    payments accrued expenses  june  we expect that the remaining obligations will be paid by march fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we undertook certain actions to restructure our business 
the restructuring resulted from a lower than expected level of license revenues which adversely affected fiscal year operating results 
the license revenue shortfall resulted primarily from delayed decision making driven by economic difficulties among customers in certain of our core vertical markets 
the restructuring plan resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge totaling million 
as of june   there was million remaining in the accrued expenses relating to the restructuring 
during the year ended june   the following activity was recorded closure consolidation of facilities accrued expenses  june  net sub lease receipts lease payments accrued expenses  june  we expect that the remaining obligations will be paid by december critical accounting estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition for both software licenses and fixed fee consulting services  impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets  accounting for income taxes  and allowance for doubtful accounts 
revenue recognition software licenses we recognize software license revenue in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
and sop no 
 as well as the various interpretations and clarifications of those statements 
these statements require that four basic criteria must be satisfied before software license revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement between ourselves and a third party exists  delivery of our product has occurred  the sales price for the product is fixed or determinable  and collection of the sales price is probable 
our management uses its judgment concerning the satisfaction of these criteria  particularly the criteria relating to the determination of whether the fee is fixed and determinable and the criteria relating to the collectibility of the receivables  particularly the installments receivable  relating to such sales 
should changes and conditions cause management to determine that these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  all or substantially all of the software license revenue recognized for such transactions could be deferred 
revenue recognition consulting services we recognize revenue associated with fixed fee service contracts in accordance with the proportional performance method  measured by the percentage of costs primarily labor incurred to date as compared to the estimated total costs primarily labor for each contract 
when a loss is anticipated on a contract  the full amount of the anticipated loss is provided currently 
our management uses its judgment concerning the estimation of the total costs to complete the contract  considering a number of factors including the experience of the personnel that are performing the services and the overall complexity of the project 
should changes and conditions cause actual results to differ significantly from management s estimates  revenue recognized in future periods could be adversely affected 
impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review the carrying value of long lived assets when circumstances dictate that they should be reevaluated  based upon the expected future operating cash flows of our business 
these future cash flow estimates are based on historical results  adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future markets and operating conditions  and are continuously reviewed based on actual operating trends 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates  and accordingly cause a full impairment of our long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we conduct at least an annual assessment on january st of the carrying value of our goodwill assets 
we obtain a third party valuation of the reporting units associated with the goodwill assets  which is based on either estimates of future income from the reporting units or estimates of the market value of the units  based on comparable recent transactions 
these estimates of future income are based upon historical results  adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future markets and operating conditions  and are continuously reviewed based on actual operating trends 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
in addition  the relevancy of recent transactions used to establish market value for our reporting units is based on management s judgment 
during the year ended june   we recorded charges related to the impairment of certain long lived assets and intangible assets and a portion of our goodwill 
the timing and size of future impairment charges involves the application of management s judgment and estimates and could result in the write off of all or substantially all of our long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill  which totaled million as of june  accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liabilities together with the assessment of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
tax assets also result from net operating losses  research and development tax credits and foreign tax credits 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period  the impact will be included in the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could result in a tax provision equal to the carrying value of our deferred tax assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices 
in determining these provisions  we analyze our historical collection experience and current economic trends 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be required for all or substantially all of certain receivable balances 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by certain consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated year ended june  revenues software licenses service and other total revenues expenses cost of software licenses cost of service and other selling and marketing research and development general and administrative costs related to acquisition goodwill impairment charge restructuring and other charges charges for in process research and development total expenses income loss from operations interest income interest expense write off of investments other income expense  net income loss before provision for benefit from income taxes comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues 
revenues are derived from software licenses  consulting services and maintenance and training 
total revenues for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal total revenues from customers outside the united states were million or of total revenues and million or of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
the geographical mix of revenues can vary from period to period 
software license revenues represented and of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
revenues from software licenses in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal software license revenues are attributable to software license renewals covering existing users  the expansion of existing customer relationships through licenses covering additional users  licenses of additional software products  and  to a lesser extent  to the addition of new customers 
greater software license revenues in fiscal were driven by the inclusion of software license revenue associated with hyprotech  offset by an overall decline in demand for our manufacturing supply chain products 
revenues and expenses associated with hyprotech are included in our results from operations from the may  date of acquisition  for fiscal this includes the month of june and for fiscal this includes the full fiscal year 
revenues from service and other consist of consulting services  post contract support on software licenses  training and sales of documentation 
revenues from service and other for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal this decline in revenue is reflective of a decrease in consulting revenue  partially offset by the inclusion of maintenance revenue associated with hyprotech 
the decline in consulting revenue primarily is related to the decline in demand for our manufacturing supply chain software products  along with which we typically sell consulting projects 
cost of software licenses 
cost of software licenses consists of royalties  amortization of previously capitalized software costs  costs related to delivery of software  including disk duplication and third party software costs  printing of manuals and packaging 
cost of software licenses for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal cost of software licenses as a percentage of revenues from software licenses increased to for fiscal from for fiscal these increases are primarily the result of a royalty arrangement with accenture  which was effective as of july  under which we pay royalties on the licensing of certain manufacturing supply chain products 
cost of service and other 
cost of service and other consists of the cost of execution of application consulting services  technical support expenses and the cost of training services 
cost of service and other for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal cost of service and other  as a percentage of revenues from service and other  decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal this decrease in absolute dollars is due to the reductions in headcount reflected in the restructuring charges of may and october the decrease as a percentage of service and other revenues was due to the headcount reductions  as well as the increase of revenues from software maintenance as a percentage of service and other revenue  a service that provides higher margins than consulting services 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal  while decreasing as a percentage of total revenues to from 
the decreases are attributable to the headcount reductions reflected in the restructuring charges of may and october  partially offset by costs associated with our october aspenworld conference  which occurs bi annually  the inclusion of costs associated with hyprotech  increases in certain foreign based sales expenses where currencies strengthened as compared to the us dollar  and an increase in sales commissions related to significantly higher license revenues in the three months ended september  as compared to the three months ended september  research and development 
research and development expenses consist of personnel and outside consultancy costs required to conduct our product development efforts 
capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated remaining economic life of the relevant product  not to exceed three years 
research and development expenses for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal  and decreased as a percentage of total revenues to from 
these decreases are attributable to the effect of reductions in headcount reflected in the restructuring charges of may and october  partially offset by the inclusion of costs associated with hyprotech and increases in certain foreign based research and development expenses where currencies strengthened as compared to the us dollar 
we capitalized software development costs that amounted to of our total research and development costs during fiscal  as compared to in fiscal this increase is due to product development activity related to the accenture co development alliance  as well as a smaller level of overall research and development spending 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries of administrative  executive  financial and legal personnel  outside professional fees and amortization of identifiable intangibles 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal  and increased as a percentage of total revenues to from 
these increases are due primarily to the full year of amortization of identifiable intangibles related to the may acquisition of hyprotech  increases to our bad debt reserve  and the inclusion of general and administrative costs associated with hyprotech  all offset by the effect of reductions in headcount reflected in the restructuring charges of may and october goodwill impairment charge 
in october  we determined that the goodwill should be tested for impairment as a result of lowered revenue expectations and the overall decline in our market value 
this amounted to a million aggregate impairment charge  recorded in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
restructuring and other charges 
during fiscal  we recorded million in restructuring and other charges 
of this amount  million is associated with our october restructuring plan  and million represents accrued legal costs  related to the ftc challenge of our acquisition of hyprotech 
the october restructuring plan resulted in a restructuring charge recorded in the three months ended december  in june we reviewed our estimates to this plan and recorded a million increase to the accrual  primarily due to revisions of the facility sub leasing assumptions  as well as adjustments to severance and other costs 
the components of the restructuring plan are as follows closure consolidation of facilities approximately million of the restructuring charge relates to the termination of facility leases and other lease related costs 
of this amount  approximately million was recorded in the three months ended december  and approximately million was recorded as a result of the june increase to the accrual 
the facility leases had remaining terms ranging from several months to eight years 
the amount accrued is an estimate of the remaining obligation under the lease or actual costs to buy out leases  reduced by expected income from the sublease of the underlying properties 
the june increase to the accrual is primarily due to revised estimates related to sublease assumptions  as actual sub lease rates have been significantly less than originally estimated and we have experienced delays contracting with sub lessors 
employee severance  benefits and related costs approximately million of the restructuring charge relates to the reduction in headcount 
of this amount  approximately million was recorded in the three months ended december  and approximately million was recorded as a result of the june increase to the accrual 
approximately employees  or of the workforce  were eliminated under the restructuring plan implemented by management 
all geographic regions and business units were affected  including services  sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative 
impairment of assets and disposition costs approximately million of the restructuring charge relates to charges associated with long lived assets that were reviewed for impairment under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and were either written down to fair value or written off due to the fact that the underlying assets will no longer be utilized 
of this amount  approximately million was recorded in the three months ended december  and approximately million was recorded as a result of the june increase to the accrual 
the resulting charges include a million impairment charge related to the intellectual property purchased from accenture in february the fair value of this asset was determined by forecasting the future net cash flows associated with the asset and then was compared to its carrying value 
this intellectual property is used primarily in the development of manufacturing supply chain software products  within our license line of business 
as noted above  the revenue expectations for the manufacturing supply chain product line were significantly reduced by management  which prompted the recoverability review  and ultimately  the impairment 
million in impairment charges related to acquired technology  computer software development costs and purchased software 
these assets were considered to be impaired because they will either no longer be used or their carrying values were in excess of their fair values 
the assets that will no longer be used were identified by management s decisions to either discontinue future development efforts associated with certain products or discontinue internal capital projects 
the carrying values of the remaining assets were compared to the fair values of those assets resulting in an impairment 
the fair values were determined by forecasting the future net cash flows associated with the products 
all of these assets were part of the license line of business 
a million impairment charge related to assets and liabilities associated with certain products which we are divesting 
these assets have historically been considered to be part of the license line of business 
as part of the cost reductions  management decided that we would no longer devote resources to the development or support of these products 
the fair value of the related assets was determined from letters of intent to purchase the intellectual property 
interest income 
interest income is generated from investment of excess cash in short term and long term investments and from the license of software pursuant to installment contracts 
under these installment contracts  we offer a customer the option to make annual payments for its term licenses instead of a single license fee payment at the beginning of the license term 
historically  a substantial majority of the asset optimization customers have elected to license these products through installment contracts 
included in the annual payments is an implicit interest rate established by us at the time of the license 
as we sell more perpetual licenses for value chain solutions  these sales are being paid for in forms that are generally not installment contracts 
if the mix of sales moves away from installment contracts  interest income in future periods will be reduced 
we sell a portion of the installment contracts to unrelated financial institutions 
the interest earned by us on the installment contract portfolio in any one year is the result of the implicit interest rate established by us on installment contracts and the size of the contract portfolio 
interest income was million for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this increase primarily is due to the increase of installment contracts associated with hyprotech 
interest expense 
interest expense was incurred under our convertible debentures  amounts owed to accenture  and capital lease obligations 
interest expense in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal this increase primarily is due to interest on the amounts owed to accenture 
foreign currency exchange loss 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily incurred through the revaluation of receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
foreign currency exchange loss in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal this decrease was due to the implementation of a more effective hedging policy for hyprotech s receivables 
in fiscal  an effective hedging policy had not yet been implemented 
income loss on equity in joint ventures and realized gain on sales of investments 
income loss on equity in joint ventures and realized gain on sales of investments was a million loss in fiscal as compared to million in income in fiscal the loss in fiscal is related to losses in the joint ventures  caused by the general economic slowdown during the year 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
we provided a full valuation against the benefit generated during fiscal and recorded a provision for income taxes of million for fiscal the provision for fiscal represents income taxes on income generated in certain foreign jurisdictions where we did not have operating loss carryforwards 
we generated significant us tax loss carryforwards during both fiscal and the provision for fiscal was comprised of an income tax provision related to foreign subsidiaries  a benefit from income taxes and an offsetting increase in the tax valuation 
under sfas no 
 a deferred tax asset related to the future benefit of a tax loss carryforward should be recorded unless we make a determination that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax asset would not be realized 
accordingly  a valuation allowance would be provided against the deferred tax asset to the extent that we cannot demonstrate that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
in determining the amount of valuation allowance required  we consider numerous factors  including historical profitability  estimated future taxable income  the volatility of the historical earnings  and the volatility of earnings of the industry in which we operate 
we periodically review our deferred tax asset to determine if such asset is realizable 
in fiscal  we concluded  in accordance with sfas no 
 that we should not recognize the full value of our deferred tax asset under the more likely than not test and therefore increased the amount of the valuation allowance 
in fiscal  we determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset would be realized

comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues 
total revenues for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal total revenues from customers outside the united states were million or of total revenues and million or of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
the geographical mix of revenues can vary from period to period 
software license revenues represented and of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
revenues from software licenses in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal lower software license revenues in fiscal were driven by significant delays in purchases by our customers in the process industries  due to the struggling economic environments in the united states and europe  which resulted in license revenues for the whole fiscal year being lower than our initially anticipated levels  all of which was offset by software licenses revenues recorded by hyprotech in fiscal revenues from service and other for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal excluding reimbursable out of pocket expenses of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  revenues from service and other increased or million from fiscal to fiscal cost of software licenses 
cost of software licenses for fiscal remained consistent with the prior year  decreasing to million from million in fiscal cost of software licenses as a percentage of revenues from software licenses increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in the cost of software licenses as a percentage of revenues from software licenses is the result of decreased license revenue  and the largely fixed nature of the costs that are included in cost of software licenses 
cost of software licenses contributed by hyprotech was not significant in fiscal cost of service and other 
cost of service and other for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal cost of service and other  as a percentage of revenues from service and other  increased to for fiscal from for fiscal excluding reimbursable out of pocket expenses of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  cost of service and other increased or million from fiscal to fiscal in addition  cost of service and other as a percentage of revenues from service and other remained consistent  increasing to in fiscal from in fiscal on this basis  the increase in cost of service and other is consistent with the increase in revenues from service and other 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal  while increasing as a percentage of total revenues to from 
the increase in selling and marketing costs was primarily attributable to an expense base that increased in the initial part of fiscal to support an expected higher license revenue level  including our investment in additional headcount to support our initiatives in the areas of expanding partnerships  in addition to sales and marketing expenses contributed by hyprotech in june fiscal also included additional expenses as compared to fiscal relating to our plans to expand certain new business initiatives  including petrovantage 
research and development 
research and development expenses for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal  and increased as a percentage of total revenues to from 
the increase in costs was attributable to a full year of costs relating to the june acquisitions of certain technology divisions of cpu and the houston consulting group  non capitalizable costs incurred in association with the accenture strategic alliance  a general increase in normal development activities and costs contributed by hyprotech in june the increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues is primarily related to lower than anticipated revenues 
we capitalized software development costs that amounted to of our total research and development costs during fiscal of this amount  related to internal costs and costs incurred by accenture  as part of the accenture strategic alliance 
the remaining related to our traditional development efforts  as compared to in fiscal general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal  and increased as a percentage of total revenues to from 
fiscal also includes million associated with the amortization of goodwill  for which there is no corresponding charge in fiscal  resulting in a comparative increase of million or 
these increases were due primarily to the full year of amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions of icarus  cpu and the houston consulting group  an increase to our bad debt reserve due to the current economic environment  an increase in certain non recurring professional fees and costs related to the settlement of minor litigation 
amortization of intangible assets  including goodwill in fiscal  was million in fiscal and million in fiscal  respectively  a decrease of in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
general and administrative expenses contributed by hyprotech were not significant in fiscal restructuring and other charges 
during fiscal  management undertook two separate restructuring plans 
the first occurred in august and amounted to million  primarily related to severance 
the second occurred in may and amounted to million  related to severance  facility consolidations and the write off of certain assets 
in addition  during fiscal  we revised estimates on previously recorded restructuring plans  resulting in a reversal of an aggregate million of facility accruals and a million increase to a severance settlement 
august restructuring plan 
during august  in light of economic uncertainties  management made a decision to adjust the business plan by reducing spending  which resulted in a restructuring charge of million  primarily for severance 
approximately employees  or of the workforce  were eliminated under the changes to the business plan implemented by management 
areas impacted included sales and marketing  services  research and development  and general and administrative 
may restructuring plan 
in the third quarter of fiscal  revenues were lower than our expectations as customers delayed spending due to the general weakness in the economy 
like many other software companies  we reduced our revenue expectations for the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year based upon the impact of these reduced revenue expectations  management evaluated our current business and made significant changes  resulting in a restructuring plan for our operations 
this restructuring plan included a reduction in headcount  tighter cost controls  the close down and consolidation of facilities  and the write off of certain assets 
close down consolidation of facilities approximately million of the restructuring charge relates to the termination of facility leases and other lease related costs 
the facility leases had remaining terms ranging from several months to nine years 
the amount accrued reflects our best estimate of the actual costs to buy out leases or to sublease the underlying properties 
employee severance  benefits and related costs approximately million of the restructuring charge relates to the reduction in headcount 
approximately employees  or of the workforce  were eliminated under the changes to the business plan implemented by management 
business units impacted included sales and marketing  services  research and development  and general and administrative  across all geographic areas 
write off of assets approximately million of the restructuring charge relates to the write off of prepaid royalties related to third party software products that we will no longer support 
adjustments to previously recorded restructuring charges 
in march  due to revised sub lease assumptions at one of our facilities  we recorded a million reversal to the restructuring accrual that had been recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal in june  due to revisions to the life of the expected sublease end dates for two facilities  we recorded million reversals to both the restructuring accrual that had been recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal and in the fourth quarter of fiscal charge for in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of hyprotech in may  million of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development projects based upon an independent appraisal 
this allocation represented the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete research and development projects 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date 
at the acquisition date  hyprotech was conducting design  development  engineering and testing activities associated with the completion of its next generation product 
this project involved developing a new componentized architecture that would result in a next generation software suite 
in addition  design and development was in progress for the next release cycle for several of hyprotech s other products 
at the acquisition date  the technologies under development ranged from to percent complete based on engineering man month data and technological progress 
anticipated completion dates ranged from three months to two years at an estimated cost of million 
in making this purchase price allocation  we considered present value calculations of income  an analysis of project accomplishments and remaining outstanding items and an assessment of overall contributions  as well as project risks 
the values assigned to purchased in process technology were determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technologies into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects  and discounting the net cash flows to their present values 
the revenue projections used to value the in process research and development were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
the resulting net cash flows from the projects are based on estimates of cost of sales  operating expenses  and income taxes from the projects 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on estimated cost of capital calculations 
due to the nature of the forecasts and the risks associated with the projected growth and profitability of the developmental projects  discount rates of to percent were considered appropriate for the in process research and development 
risks related to the completion of technology under development include the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in achieving technological feasibility  anticipated levels of market acceptance and penetration  market growth rates and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets 
interest income 
interest income was million for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this decrease is due to the general decline in interest rates during fiscal which affected interest earned on installment contracts and our short term investments 
interest expense 
interest expense in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal write off of investment 
during fiscal and we invested million in optimum logistics ltd 
consisting of cash and stock  of which was refunded in march this investment entitled us to a minority interest in optimum logistics and was accounted for using the cost method 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that our investment in optimum logistics was impaired and this investment of million was written off  in addition to million of other write offs 
foreign currency exchange loss 
foreign currency exchange loss in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal this increase was due to the weakening of the us dollar against european currencies and translation losses attributable to hyprotech s receivables during the month of june for which we had not yet implemented an effective hedging policy 
income on equity in joint ventures and realized gain on sales of investments 
income on equity in joint ventures and realized gain on sales of investments was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal in fiscal this consisted entirely of income on equity in joint ventures 
in fiscal  this primarily consisted of million of realized gains on the partial sale of two investments and million of income on equity in joint ventures 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million and a benefit from income taxes of million for fiscal and  respectively 
the provision for fiscal represents income taxes on income generated in certain foreign jurisdictions where we did not have operating loss carryforwards 
we generated significant us tax loss carryforwards during both fiscal and the provision for fiscal also included a benefit from income taxes and a corresponding increase in the tax valuation of million 
quarterly results our operating results and cash flow have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  including purchasing patterns  timing of introductions of new solutions and enhancements by us and our competitors  and fluctuating economic conditions 
because license fees for our software products are substantial and the implementation of our solutions often requires the services of our engineers over an extended period of time  the sales process for our solutions is lengthy and can exceed one year 
accordingly  software revenues are difficult to predict  and the delay of any order could cause our quarterly revenues to fall substantially below expectations 
moreover  to the extent that we succeed in shifting customer purchases away from point solutions and toward integrated solutions  the likelihood of delays in ordering may increase and the effect of any delay may become more pronounced 
we ship software products within a short period after receipt of an order and usually do not have a material backlog of unfilled orders of software products 
consequently  revenues from software licenses  including license renewals  in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
historically  a majority of each quarter s revenues from software licenses has been derived from license agreements that have been consummated in the final weeks of the quarter 
therefore  even a short delay in the consummation of an agreement may cause revenues to fall below expectations for that quarter 
since our expense levels are based in part on anticipated revenues  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any revenue shortfall and any revenue shortfall would likely have a disproportionately adverse effect on net income 
we expect that these factors will continue to affect our operating results for the foreseeable future

in fiscal and  operating activities used million and million of cash  respectively 
in fiscal  investing activities provided million of cash primarily as a result of the maturity of short term investments  offset in part by an increase in computer software development costs and purchases of property and leasehold improvements 
in fiscal and  investing activities used million and million of cash  respectively 
in fiscal  financing activities used million of cash primarily due to payments made on our amount owed to accenture and on our long term debt and capital lease obligations 
in fiscal and  financing activities provided million and million of cash  respectively 
historically  we have financed our operations principally through cash generated from public offerings of our convertible debentures and common stock  private offerings of our series b convertible preferred stock and common stock  operating activities  and the sale of installment contracts to third parties 
additionally  in august we closed on a private offering of the series d preferred 
in august  we issued and sold  shares of series d preferred  along with warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
concurrently  we paid million and issued  shares of series d preferred  along with warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock  to repurchase all of the outstanding series b i and b ii preferred 
the series d preferred  earns cumulative dividends at an annual rate of  that are payable when and if declared by the board  in cash or  subject to certain conditions  common stock 
each share of series d preferred is initially convertible into shares of common stock  subject to anti dilution and other adjustments 
as a result  the shares of series d preferred initially were convertible into an aggregate of approximately  shares of common stock 
the series d preferred is subject to redemption at the option of the holders as follows on or after august  and on or after august  we intend to use million in proceeds from the sale of our series d preferred to repay a portion of the convertible debentures at or prior to maturity 
we cannot use those proceeds for any other purpose without the consent of the holders of the series d preferred 
we may also attempt to increase the sale of our installment contracts and use these proceeds from such sales to fund additional repurchases of our convertible debentures at or prior to maturity 
historically  we have had arrangements to sell long term installments receivable to two financial institutions  general electric capital corporation and fleet business credit corporation 
these contracts represent amounts due over the life of existing term licenses 
during fiscal  and  we sold million  million and million of installments receivable  respectively 
as of june  there was approximately million in additional availability under the arrangements 
we expect to continue to have the ability to sell installments receivable  as the collection of the sold receivables will reduce the outstanding balance  and the availability under the arrangements can be increased 
at june  we had a partial recourse obligation that was within the range of million to million 
we may in the future establish new arrangements to sell additional installment contracts to other financial institutions and increase our cash position 
in january  we executed a loan arrangement with silicon valley bank 
this arrangement provides a line of credit of up to the lesser of i million or ii of eligible domestic receivables  and a line of credit of up to the lesser of i million or ii of eligible foreign receivables 
the lines of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate at june  plus  which may be reduced to the bank s prime rate upon the achievement of two consecutive quarters of net income 
we are required to maintain a million compensating cash balance with the bank  or be subject to an unused line fee and collateral handling fees 
the lines of credit will initially be collateralized by nearly all of our assets  and upon achieving certain net income targets  the collateral will be reduced to a lien on our accounts receivable 
we are required to meet certain financial covenants  including minimum tangible net worth  minimum cash balances and an adjusted quick ratio 
as of june   there were million in letters of credit outstanding under the line of credit  and there was million available for future borrowing 
in august  we executed an amendment to the loan arrangement that adjusted the terms of certain financial covenants  and cured a default of the tangible net worth covenant as of june  the loan arrangement expires in january as of june   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
our commitments as of june  consisted primarily of the maturity of the convertible debentures  amounts owed to accenture  capital lease obligations  and leases on our headquarters and other facilities 
other than these  there were no other material commitments for capital or other expenditures 
our obligations related to these items at june  are as follows in thousands thereafter non cancellable operating leases     non cancellable capital leases and debt obligations   amounts owed to accenture includes royalty minimums   maturity of convertible debentures  total commitments      we believe our current cash balances  availability of sales of our installment contracts  availability under the silicon valley bank line of credit  cash flows from our operations and proceeds from our august series d preferred financing will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
however  we may need to obtain additional financing thereafter or earlier  if our current plans and projections prove to be inaccurate or our expected cash flows prove to be insufficient to fund our operations because of lower than expected revenues  unanticipated expenses or other unforeseen difficulties  due to normal operations or ftc related costs 
in addition  we may seek to take advantage of favorable market conditions by raising additional funds from time to time through public or private security offerings  debt financings  strategic alliances or other financing sources 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a number of factors  including market conditions  our operating performance and investor interest 
these factors may make the timing  amount  terms and conditions of any financing unattractive 
they may also result in our incurring additional indebtedness or accepting stockholder dilution 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may have to forego strategic acquisitions or investments  reduce or defer our development activities  or delay our introduction of new products and services 
any of these actions may seriously harm our business and operating results

foreign exchange forward contracts are only purchased to hedge certain customer installments receivable amounts denominated in a foreign currency 
foreign exchange hedging we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations on customer installments receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
the objective of these contracts is to limit the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movement on our operating results 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we had million of foreign exchange forward contracts denominated in japanese  british  swiss  singapore and euro currencies which represented underlying customer installments receivable transactions at the end of fiscal we adopted sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal as a result  at each balance sheet date  the foreign exchange forward contracts and the related installments receivable denominated in foreign currencies are revalued based on the current market exchange rates 
resulting gains and losses are included in earnings or deferred as a component of other comprehensive income 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs 
gains and losses related to these instruments for fiscal were not material to our financial position 
we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  operating results or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments
