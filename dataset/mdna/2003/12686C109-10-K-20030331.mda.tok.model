cablevision systems corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies in preparing its financial statements  the company is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following restructuring charges in  the company recorded a charge to income representing the cost of restructuring its operations 
the costs included in the charge principally consisted of employee termination costs  such as severance pay and outplacement services  and provisions for lease termination costs  including an estimate of costs incurred during a projected vacancy period  estimated brokerage commissions and tenant allowances 
in  the company announced a new operating plan and restructuring which included the closing of retail electronics store locations  the elimination of certain staff positions  the reduction of capital expenditures and the disposition of its motion picture theater business 
additionally  the company reached an agreement with its supplier of set top boxes which reduced the company s purchase commitments for set top boxes from million in  million in  and million in to a total remaining commitment of million in and nothing thereafter and requires the company to make certain other cash payments aggregating million plus interest on a portion of such amount with respect to  among other things  a license for certain software valued at million based on an independent appraisal 
in connection with this plan  the company recorded restructuring charges  which include employee termination costs  such as severance pay and outplacement services costs  and provisions for lease termination costs including an estimate of costs incurred during a projected vacancy period  estimated brokerage commissions and tenant allowances and other related costs and the cost associated with the reduction in required digital set top box commitments 
costs related to employee terminations are estimated on an individual by individual basis  giving effect to the announced severance plan 
costs for lease terminations are projected in consultation with real estate professionals 
actual lease termination costs may differ from these estimates as a result of changes in market conditions 
changes in estimates  as the plan is implemented and additional facts are gathered  are reflected in current operations as adjustments to the restructuring charges  separately reported and identified 
impairment of long lived assets the company s long lived assets at december  include excess costs over fair value of net assets acquired of approximately billion  approximately billion of other intangible assets and approximately billion of property  plant and equipment 
such assets accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated total assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangibles the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or material related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and was required to analyze its goodwill for impairment issues during the first six months of fiscal  and then on a periodic basis thereafter 
during the years ended december  and  the company recorded an impairment loss of million and million representing the balance of goodwill related to certain theaters of clearview cinemas 
in  the company recorded an impairment loss of million representing the write down of fixed assets relating to the company s retail electronics business 
valuation of deferred tax assets deferred tax assets have resulted primarily from the company s historical net operating losses 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
the company s ability to realize its deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income to allow for the utilization of its net operating loss carry forwards and deductible temporary differences 
if such estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
in and  the company s income tax expense reflected reductions in the valuation allowances related to its net deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
in  the income tax benefit of the company reflects an increase in the valuation allowance of million 
at the end of the second quarter  nbc exchanged part of its interest in rainbow media holdings for shares of rainbow media group common stock 
as a result of this exchange  rainbow media holdings became a member of the consolidated federal income tax return of the company 
the exchange was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the valuation allowance was reduced to zero  resulting in a reduction to the recorded goodwill  without any income statement benefit 
plant and equipment the direct costs and a portion of certain indirect costs  such as employee benefits  facilities and warehousing  associated with the construction of the company s cable transmission and distribution system and the provision of new cable service installations  are capitalized 
certain of these costs are based on estimates of activity levels and other historical statistics 
these estimates are evaluated at least semi annually  and any changes that result  which may be significant  are reflected in the results of operations in the period in which the evaluations are performed

upon the closing of the transaction  the previously existing amc bravo and rainbow media group credit facilities terminated by their terms and outstanding borrowings were repaid 
in january  rainbow media holdings monetized the value of the general electric common stock received in the transaction through the execution of prepaid forward contracts  collateralized by an equivalent amount of the underlying general electric stock 
these contracts set a floor and ceiling on the company s participation in the changes in the underlying stock price and at maturity are expected to offset negative changes in the fair value of the general electric stock  while allowing for upside appreciation potential to the ceiling price 
at maturity  the contracts provide for the option to deliver cash or shares of general electric stock  with a value determined by reference to the stock price at maturity

proceeds from the issuance of the security were used to reduce restricted group bank debt 
restricted group as of december   our restricted group consisted of csc holdings and all of its subsidiaries holding our cable operations  which encompassed approximately million subscribers  the commercial telephone operations of lightpath on long island  new york  and our consumer high speed data operations  which encompassed approximately  subscribers as of such date 
the restricted group s primary sources of liquidity have been cash flow from operations  its bank credit facility and its access to the capital markets as evidenced by its outstanding senior  senior subordinated and redeemable preferred stock issuances and proceeds from asset sales 
in addition  in march  the restricted group received million in cash from rainbow media holdings 
currently  the restricted group has a billion revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks 
the facility matures on june   requires no interim commitment reductions  and permits maximum leverage of times cash flow as defined in the credit agreement through march  as of march   the restricted group had outstanding borrowings under its credit facility of  million and outstanding letters of credit of million  resulting in undrawn revolver commitments of million 
the restricted group s revolver contains certain covenants that may limit its ability to utilize all of the undrawn funds available thereunder  including covenants requiring the restricted group to maintain certain financial ratios and restricting the permitted use of borrowed funds 
the restricted group s plant upgrade  combined with additional amounts required for the start up and operation of new businesses such as digital video services  voice over internet protocol service  lightpath s non long island based commercial telephone business  and business high speed data services create a net funding requirement 
in addition  we expect that the restricted group will fund certain expenditures relating to the construction and launch in of a direct broadcast satellite  expected to total million in  as well as certain investments in northcoast communications until the sale described above is consummated 
we currently expect that the net funding and investment requirements for will be met with borrowings under the restricted group s existing bank credit facility and that the restricted group s available borrowing capacity under that facility will be sufficient to meet such requirements 
r l dbs has requested an extension of the launch date of a direct broadcast satellite to august  due to the satellite manufacturer s need for additional time for scheduling and testing of the launch vehicle for the satellite 
the fcc requires commencement of service offerings by not later than december  we continue to evaluate our strategic and financial alternatives with respect to our investment in r l dbs 
these alternatives could include launch of a nationally or regionally marketed broadcast satellite business 
our liquidity projections do not include the impact of any further investment beyond the projected million investment in depending upon the scope of further investment in a satellite business venture  or in any other investment alternative  significant additional funding may be required 
funding for such further investment could come from pending or future asset sales  issuance of new debt or equity securities  or strategic or financial partners 
the restricted group s future access to the public debt markets and the cost of any future debt issuances are influenced by its credit ratings  which are provided by moody s investor services and standard poor s 
standard and poor s recently reaffirmed the ratings on the restricted group s outstanding securities and retained a negative outlook on the restricted group s ratings 
moody s recently took our ratings off of credit watch  reaffirmed our bond credit ratings and gave the company s ratings a stable outlook 
any downgrades by either rating agency would increase the restricted group s interest rate on future debt issuances and could adversely impact its ability to raise additional funds

the facility contains certain covenants that may limit amc  the independent film channel and we s ability to utilize all of the undrawn funds available thereunder  including covenants requiring the maintenance of financial ratios and restricting the permitted use of borrowed funds 
currently amc  the independent film channel and we partnerships generate net free cash flow  however  certain of rainbow media holdings operations  including regional news and the developmental activities of certain of rainbow media holdings businesses  including projected investments in new programming content and services such as the video on demand programming services being developed  including the mag rack service  require funding 
such funding may be obtained through cash generated from other rainbow media holdings operations or through borrowings under the rainbow media holdings credit facility 
we believe we have sufficient availability from cash from operations and committed credit facilities to fund rainbow media holdings cash requirements through in january  fox sports networks exercised its right to put its interest in fox sports net chicago and fox sports net bay area to regional programming partners 
fox sports networks put right with respect to its interest in the of regional programming partners that it owns was not exercised and is not exercisable again until december rainbow media holdings and fox sports networks must determine the fair market value of fox sports networks interest in these two businesses  either through negotiation or through an independent appraisal process

in the event that rainbow media holdings elects to effect the ipo  such ipo must be consummated within days of fox sports networks delivery of the put notice 
if rainbow media holdings elects to purchase fox sports networks interests  payment for such interest s may be made  at rainbow media holdings election  either i with shares of cablevision common stock  valued at the then current market price based on a day trailing average  or ii with a three year bullet promissory note of regional programming partners bearing interest at prime plus and secured by the fox sports networks interest s purchased

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks from changes in certain equity security prices and interest rates 
the company s exposure to interest rate movements results from its use of floating and fixed rate debt to fund its working capital  capital expenditures  and other operational and investment requirements 
to manage interest rate risk  the company has entered into interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable and fixed interest rates 
such contracts fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to provide an economic hedge against the risk of rising rates and or convert fixed rate borrowings to variable rates to provide an economic hedge against the risk of higher borrowing costs in a declining interest rate environment 
in addition  from time to time the company may utilize short term interest rate lock agreements to hedge the risk that the cost of a future issuance of fixed rate debt may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
the company does not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
the company s exposure to changes in equity security prices stems primarily from the comcast  at t  charter communications  at t wireless services  general electric  and adelphia communications common stock held by the company 
the company has entered into prepaid forward contracts to hedge its equity price risk and to monetize the value of these securities 
these contracts  at maturity  are expected to offset negative changes in the fair value of these securities  while allowing for certain upside appreciation potential 
in the event of an early termination of such contracts  however  the company would be obligated to repay the monetization indebtedness less the sum of the fair value of the underlying stock and the fair value of the equity collar  calculated at the termination date 
the underlying stock and equity collars are carried at fair market value on the company s consolidated balance sheet and the monetization indebtedness is carried at its accreted value 
fair value of debt based on the level of interest rates prevailing at december   the carrying value of the company s fixed rate debt and redeemable preferred stock of  million exceeded its fair value of  million by approximately million 
the fair value of these financial instruments is estimated based on reference to quoted market prices for these or comparable securities 
the company s floating rate borrowings bear interest at current market rates and thus approximate fair value 
the effect of a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates prevailing at december  would increase the estimated fair value of fixed rate debt and redeemable preferred stock instruments by approximately million 
this estimate is based on the assumption of an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across all maturities 
interest rate derivative contracts as of december   the company had outstanding interest rate swap contracts to convert floating rate debt to fixed rate debt covering a total notional principal amount of  million 
as of december   the fair market value of these interest rate swap contracts was approximately million  a net liability position  as reflected under derivative contracts in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
assuming an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across the yield curve  a basis point decrease in interest rates from december  prevailing levels would decrease the fair market value of these contracts by approximately million to a net liability position of million 
in addition  the company had outstanding prepaid interest rate swap contracts with a notional value of  million entered into in connection with its monetization transactions 
as of december   such contracts had a fair market value of million  a net liability position  reflected as liabilities under derivative contracts in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
assuming an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across the yield curve  a basis point increase in interest rates from december  prevailing levels would decrease the fair market value of these contracts by approximately million to a liability of million 
equity price risk as of december   the fair market value and the carrying value of the company s holdings of comcast  at t  charter communications  at t wireless  general electric and adelphia communications common stock aggregated million
