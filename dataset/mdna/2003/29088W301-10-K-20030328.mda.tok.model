item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a technology company providing food safety  individual animal tracking and supply management services to the beef production industry 
through december   our primary revenue source was cattle marketing both cattle brokerage and auction barn activities 
in the first half of  we determined the best way to improve our productivity and the use of our working capital would be to sell or dispose of all of our cattle operations and focus primarily on food safety and supply chain management 
during the second half of  we aggressively divested ourselves of these cattle operations and as of january   completed the divestiture of all our cattle operations

acquisitions and divestitures from may through january  we acquired thirteen cattle brokerage companies with the aim of increasing our presence and market share within the cattle industry 
through these acquisitions  we significantly increased our capacity to market cattle throughout the united states 
following these acquisitions  the cattle industry experienced difficulties due to an extended drought in the southern plains and the southeast  which led to a decrease in the availability of feeder cattle for sale  which led to a significantly reduced number of head sold in each quarter in in the fourth quarter of  we completed lease and operating agreements with three of our largest order buying facilities in order to reduce the working capital requirements for our owned operations 
in and  under new management  we began to focus our efforts on primarily two business groups  supply chain management and food safety technology

 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no

based on the results of the impairment test  all goodwill related to cattle operations was written off 
because of the significance of these acquisitions and divestitures and the resulting changes to our products and services  our historical financial results may not be indicative of our future performance 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  and principles of consolidation 
revenue recognition we historically generated the majority of our revenue from cattle sales transactions where we act as either a principal or agent in the purchase and sale of cattle 
for cattle sales transactions where we were the principal in the arrangement  we purchased cattle and took title from the seller  recorded the cattle as inventory until delivered to an accepted buyer and were exposed to both the inventory and credit risk that resulted from the transaction 
in these types of transactions  we recorded the gross revenue earned and related product costs incurred 
for cattle sales transactions in which we acted as an agent  we sold cattle consigned to us on a commission basis  where we were not subject to inventory and credit risk  or we sold cattle on a fee basis and we recorded the net revenue earned 
for all other products and services offered by us  we act as a principal to the transaction and gross revenue and related product cost are recognized as products are shipped or services are provided 
impairment of long lived assets we account for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no

 which we 
table of contents adopted as of january  this statement addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of

 but retains the fundamental provisions of sfas no 
for a recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and b measurement of long lived assets to be disposed by sale 
sfas no 
also supercedes the accounting and reporting of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
under sfas no 
 long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are classified as held for sale when six specific criteria are met 
assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
goodwill is included in an asset group when the asset group is or includes a reporting unit 
the results of operations of a component of an entity that has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale is reported in discontinued operations when the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity as a result of the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction 
a component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can clearly be distinguished  operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of an entity 
in the period in which a component of an entity has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale  the income statement for current and prior periods report the results of operations of the component  including any gain or loss resulting from adjustments to fair value  in discontinued operations 
assets not meeting the criteria of held for sale  continue to be classified as held and used until they are disposed of 
impairment losses for assets held and used are measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long lived asset asset group exceeds its fair value and are included in continuing operations 
during the second quarter of  we determined that we would sell or close all the remaining owned cattle operations 
in connection with the determination to divest these operations and pursuant to sfas no 
 we evaluated the fair value of the long lived assets  including intangibles of our cattle operations 
the assets of the operations  which were liquidated or sold  were adjusted to the estimated fair value and both the write down of these assets and the results of operations for these businesses are included in discontinued operations 
the remaining cattle operation  which was disposed in january  does not meet the criteria of held for sale and  accordingly  is considered held and used 
both the write down of the associated asset and the results of operations for this business is included in the operating results from continuing operations for all periods presented 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of emerge interactive  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
the consolidation also includes all activities with related entities  notwithstanding lack of technical majority ownership  which is necessary to present fairly our financial position and results of operations because of the existence of a parent subsidiary relationship by means other than record ownership of voting stock 
specifically  the activities conducted by related party entities related to the lease and operating agreements are consolidated even though we do not have a voting control technical majority ownership 
rather  we have consolidated these activities due to the parent subsidiary relationship created by the lease and operating agreements 
minority interest reflects the lessee operators equity interest in the activities under the lease and operating agreements consolidated in the financial statements 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the company and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  revenue from cattle sales decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease reflects a lower volume of cattle sales transactions brought about by industry conditions and our efforts to divest remaining cattle operations 
during the fiscal year ended december   we sold approximately  head of cattle versus  head sold in the comparable prior year period 
revenue from other products and services decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease reflects the effects of discontinuing platform sales and equine camera sales as well as a decrease in pcc sales 
the cattle revenue will desist in the next year  while revenue from other products and services are expected to increase significantly over the next several years 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the direct cost to acquire cattle  and cattle related products 
in addition  cost of revenue also includes the indirect overhead costs  such as support personnel  facilities costs  telecommunication charges and material purchases that are primarily associated with supporting our information management and individual animal tracking products and services 
with the lower volumes of cattle sales transactions generated in fiscal year  cost of revenue attributed to cattle sales decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  cost of revenue attributed to other products and services decreased to  for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is due principally to lower indirect overhead and a decrease in communications cost to support products 
we generated a gross profit of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit is due primarily to the decrease in total cattle sold as cost of goods decreased in proportion to the decrease in revenue 
the cost of cattle revenue will decrease to zero with the completion of the cattle divestures in january we anticipate that costs of revenue associated with other products and services will increase as sales of other goods and services increase 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefit costs  insurance program charges  material and supply purchases  professional service fees  telephone  travel  consulting  advertising and media expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily associated with the cost savings initiatives that began during the second quarter of and continued into  which included several workforce reductions 
this cost savings was partially offset by a provision against uncollectible receivables cattle deposits of approximately  taken in the second quarter of management has implemented significant restructuring efforts over the last year to resize the business to focus on the verifeye and supply chain management business models 
as a result  the prior periods are not readily comparable to our current and future efforts 
we anticipate selling  general and administrative expenses to continue to be reduced as the impact of our cost saving initiatives continue to become fully realized and our divestiture activity is completed 
technology and development our technology and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefit costs  payments to outside consultants  software purchases and maintenance charges and project material costs 
our expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily associated with the reduction of workforce 
in addition 
table of contents materials  supplies and consulting expenses had significant decreases 
furthermore  the company has fewer products under development and products such as cattlelog  our exclusive individual animal data collection and reporting system  is essentially complete 
the primary focus of our development team is our meat inspection system  verifeye 
we expect to continue to incur costs to develop and commercialize new products  expand our offerings and adapt our technologies to new markets

during  we recorded million in impairment and related charges including million in noncash asset impairment charges  million in severance and related employee costs and  in other closure  employee and professional costs 
the following paragraphs review our restructuring efforts and the basis for asset impairments 
in april  we determined that we would sell or dispose of our cattle operations 
the operations we determined to sell were evaluated to determine the fair value of the assets held for sale 
both the adjustment to fair value and the results of operations for these cattle operations have been recorded in discontinued operations 
the operations we determined to dispose were also evaluated to determine the fair value of the assets and we recorded impairment of the associated goodwill in the amount of million

as part of this decision  we determined the remaining fair value of the capitalized software expenses incurred to establish the original website design and recorded an impairment charge of  in addition  we recorded an impairment of  to write off the unamortized goodwill associated with our acquisition of cyberstockyard  inc in december  we performed an additional review of the intangible asset related to the purchase of professional cattle consultants  llc in may and determined that the additional capital expenditures required to update this technology and increase its market share would not be cost beneficial 
without this additional capital investment the estimated fair value of the intangible asset was  under the provisions of sfas no

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to the adoption of sfas  which changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
goodwill amortization charges of  are included in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  if we had not adopted sfas we would have recorded  in amortization expense for the current year

 compared to  is due to the impairment of both tangible and intangible assets recorded during and 
table of contents other income and expense interest and other income  net increased to million for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to miscellaneous income relating to the favorable settlement of certain consulting and litigation fees  which had been previously accrued

due to the losses incurred  we did not recognize income tax expense for the years ended december  and as of december   we had approximately million of federal income tax loss carry forwards that can be used to offset future taxable income

beginning with the effective date of each agreement  the cattle brokerage operations formerly conducted in wholly owned subsidiaries were conducted in entities owned solely by employees of the company 
the lease and operating agreements were generally for a one year term  renewable  and provided for us to receive of the net profits or losses as defined in the agreements and have certain control over operating activities while the lessee operators were responsible for obtaining lines of credit for working capital purposes and were responsible for the day to day operations of the activities  including payroll and operating expenses

we also engaged in both cattle purchase and sale transactions with certain related parties  primarily entities related to or owned by acquired companies 
these sales were made on the same credit terms as our other customers and suppliers

table of contents factors affecting our business  financial condition and results of operations cautionary statement this annual report on form k contains statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements can be identified by the use of predictive  future tense or forward looking terminology  such as anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  intends  may  will and words of similar meaning 
these statements include statements regarding  among other things  our product and service development  projected capital expenditures  liquidity and capital  development of additional revenue sources  expansion into new market segments  technological advancement  ability to develop brand awareness and market acceptance of our products 
these statements are based on management s current expectations and are subject to a number of uncertainties and risks that could cause actual results to differ significantly from those described in the forward looking statements  including the acceptance by our customers of our products and use of the internet in connection with our beef supply chain management services  our ability to grow revenue  our ability to increase margins  the impact of competition on pricing  general economic conditions  employee turnover  the impact of litigation and other factors 
other factors that may cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in factors affecting our business  financial condition and results of operation  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report and as set forth from time to time in our other public filings and public statements 
readers of this report are cautioned to consider these risks and uncertainties and to not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
in addition to the other information included in this report and our other public filings and releases  the following factors should be considered while evaluating our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects we have a history of net losses and expect to continue to incur net losses for the next year 
if we continue to incur net losses  our business may not ultimately be financially viable 
we have incurred significant net losses since inception 
we reported a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december   or of total revenue  and a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december   or of total revenue 
as of december   we had accumulated net losses totaling approximately million 
our revenue may not grow as anticipated and  as a result  our financial condition and results of our operations may be harmed and our business may not be financially viable in the future 
to achieve profitability  we must successfully address the following risks lack of wide scale commercial acceptance of our products and services  failure to introduce new products and services  inability to respond promptly to competitive and industry developments  failure to achieve brand recognition  and failure to upgrade and enhance our technologies to accommodate expanded product and service offerings and increased customer traffic 
if we are unable to successfully address any of these risks  our business may be harmed 
our two business segments are difficult to evaluate because they have a limited operating history 
although we were formed in  our current products and services offerings have a very limited operating history 
recently  we have focused our strategy on providing food safety and supply management services 
as of 
table of contents december   the products of our food safety group had not provided us with any revenue  although deposits for solo orders had been received 
also as of that date  the products and services of our supply chain management group had provided us with only a very small portion of our aggregate historical revenue 
if we are unable to develop a market for the products of our food safety group  are unable to expand the products and services of our supply chain management group  or if any of our products do not perform as we expect them to  our results of operations and prospects will be materially and adversely impacted 
our business may be harmed by competitors 
in the event the demand for food safety technology increases in the future  or if governmental agencies mandate compliance with certain food safety technology or procedures  we may face competition from companies that may develop competing technologies or services 
because the market for beef production consists primarily of a number of large producers  it is possible that these competing technologies or services will be created by companies with significantly greater resources than ours 
in the event we are unable to effectively compete with these new technologies or services  our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted 
our ability to develop new products is uncertain and our products may not develop as we anticipate 
the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of developing new products is inherently uncertain 
prospective products  such as our meat inspection system  require time and resources to develop  may not ultimately be commercially viable  may not achieve commercial acceptance in the marketplace and may fail to receive regulatory approval  if required 
in addition  new products by competitors could adversely affect the realization of products that are commercially successful 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  our business and competitive position will be harmed 
proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position 
we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark law and confidentiality agreements with third parties 
we cannot guarantee that any of our pending patent or trademark applications will be approved 
even if they are approved  the patents or trademarks may be challenged by other parties or invalidated 
because brand recognition is an important component of our business strategy  the protection of our trademarks is critical to our success 
in addition  we depend upon our proprietary database of industry and client information to provide our clients with our information services 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products and technology or obtain access to our confidential proprietary database 
other parties may also breach confidentiality agreements and other protective contracts 
we may not become aware of these breaches or have adequate remedies available 
in addition  effective copyright  patent and trademark protection may be unavailable in certain countries to which we might expand our operations 
we are also reliant on our exclusive licensing arrangement with iowa state university and the agricultural research service 
if we breach this agreement  our rights to the technology incorporated into our food safety products could be limited or eliminated  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in technology markets  there is generally frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation 
we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims  including claims that we infringe third party proprietary rights 
while we are not aware of any patents  copyrights or other rights that would prevent us from manufacturing and commercializing our products or services in the united states and abroad  there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert infringement claims against us 
there also can be no assurance that former employers of our present and future employees will not claim that our employees have improperly disclosed confidential or proprietary information to us 
any of these claims  with or without merit  could subject us to costly litigation and divert the attention of our personnel 

table of contents we expect our quarterly operating results to fluctuate 
if we fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the market price of our common stock could decline 
we expect that our revenue and operating results will vary in the future as a result of a number of factors 
our quarterly results of operations may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
our operating results in the future may not follow any prior trends and should not be relied upon as an indication of future results 
the factors that affect our quarterly operating results include our ability to generate revenues and profits in our two business groups  our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers  our ability to develop and market new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis  the introduction of new or enhanced products and services by us  and continued purchases by our existing customers 
in addition  a number of factors that are beyond our control will also affect our quarterly operating results  such as demand for our products and services  product and price competition  the introduction of new or enhanced products and services by our competitors  and significant downturns in our targeted markets 
internet capital group and safeguard will be able to control matters requiring stockholder approval 
the concentration of ownership of our common stock may delay  deter or prevent acts that would result in a change of control  which could reduce the market price of our common stock 
internet capital group and safeguard are affiliated entities 
internet capital group and safeguard together have the power to vote approximately as of december  of the aggregate number of votes to which the holders of our common stock are entitled 
as a result  these stockholders will be able to control all matters requiring stockholder approval 
in addition  currently four of the nine members of our board of directors also serve as directors  officers and or senior executives of internet capital group and safeguard 
internet capital group has the right to elect two directors to our board 
under the joint venture agreement  safeguard and internet capital group have agreed to vote for two designees of safeguard and two designees of internet capital group in all future elections of directors 
internet capital group and safeguard will therefore have the ability to significantly influence our management 
our common stock price is likely to be highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock  like the market for internet related and technology companies in general  has been and will likely continue to be highly volatile 
any significant fluctuations in the future might result in a material decline in the market price of our common stock 
these fluctuations may be caused by factors such as actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations  
table of contents conditions or trends in the cattle industry  new sales formats of new products or services  changes in or failure by us to meet financial estimates of securities analysts  conditions or trends in the internet industry  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships or joint ventures  capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  and sales of common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we held no derivative securities as of december  our exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and their potential impact on our investment portfolio 
we invest in marketable debt securities that meet high credit quality standards and limit our credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of investment 
as of december   our investments consisted of  in cash equivalents with maturities of less than three months 
due to the short term  conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations or the fair value of our portfolio 
the impact on our future results of operations and the future value of our portfolio will depend largely on the gross amount of our investments
