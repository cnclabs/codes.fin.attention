item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that are based upon current expectations 
our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under risk factors  forward looking statements and elsewhere in this report 
you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with selected financial data and the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview paradigm genetics  inc the company or paradigm was founded on september  as a biotechnology company driving research and development productivity by focusing its integrated suite of technologies on the product development cycle  from target discovery to enhancement of the safety and efficacy profiles 
the company uses a systems biology approach to understand gene function in the context of biological pathways and to develop assays and biomarkers for molecular diagnostic solutions for life sciences companies 
we currently have commercial partnerships with bayer crop sciences bayer in the area of crop production  the monsanto company monsanto in the areas of crop production and nutrition and vddi pharmaceuticals in the area of infectious diseases 
our commercial partnership with bayer was signed in september and was extended in june under the terms of the agreement  the companies will collaborate on herbicide discovery for up to an additional five years through september this includes three years of committed funding through september  plus a two year option through september the commercial partnership with monsanto was signed in november and began contributing revenues in the second quarter of fiscal year during september  we announced that monsanto had amended the commercial partnership agreement by eliminating its option to terminate the agreement without cause in exchange for broader commercialization rights 
this amendment commits monsanto to a total partnership term of six years with committed funding through january during november we announced that the research plan under the commercial partnership with monsanto had been revised 
the revision to the research plan slowed the timing of our revenue recognition during the fourth quarter  but will not alter the amount of revenue we will recognize from the commercial partnership 
our commercial partnership with vddi pharmaceuticals was signed in february  for the development of antibiotics for the treatment of gram positive bacterial infections 
under the agreement  we used our metabolic profiling platform to prioritize lead compounds targeting the essential bacterial enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide synthetase for further preclinical development 
vddi pharmaceuticals began contributing to our revenues in the third quarter of this commercial partnership ended in december  and as such will no longer contribute to our revenue 
we also have a million five year contract with niehs that was signed in september and began contributing to our revenue in the fourth quarter of under the terms of the contract we will use our technologies to determine how toxicants work and cause damage at the cellular level 
in addition we have three government grants 
our advanced technology program atp grant from nist was awarded in june for million over five years 
the grant will be shared equally between paradigm and lion bioscience ag this grant is in the area of target validation and will support the development of a target assessment technologies suite tats  which is intended to increase the number and success rate of validated targets for product development by the pharmaceutical and other life sciences industries 
we anticipate significant commercial applications for the new technologies 
the remaining two grants are with the national science foundation nsf in the areas of modification of terpenoid production in mint  and the development of a high throughput gene discovery system in arabidopsis using geminivirus 
the first grant was awarded in june for modification of terpenoid production in mint  and in july a second grant was awarded for a high 
table of contents throughput gene discovery system in arabidopsis using geminivirus 
during the year ended december  we generated revenues from a grant from the us department of energy that ended in june we have invested heavily in developing our genefunction factory  metabolic profiling platform  and functionfinder systems 
we occupy office and laboratory space totaling approximately  square feet 
during we reorganized our operations to better focus our resources in order to grow the human healthcare and agricultural businesses 
all costs associated with the reorganization were incurred and expensed during we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million and total stockholders equity was approximately million 
our net loss increased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in our net loss was due to lower revenues from our commercial partnership with bayer  offset  in part  by a decrease in total operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased to approximately million for the year ended december   from approximately million for the year ended december  we expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to advance our internal research and development programs  primarily in the healthcare area 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenues are derived from commercial partnerships and government contracts and grants 
payments from our commercial contracts are generally related to refundable or nonfundable fees  milestone achievements or assay deliveries 
payments for refundable and nonrefundable fees and milestone achievements are recognized as revenues on a progress to completion basis over the term of the respective commercial partnership  except with respect to refundable fees for which revenue recognition does not commence until the refund right expires 
payments related to assay deliveries are recognized as revenues when accepted by the other party 
payments received under the company s commercial partnerships and government contracts and grants are generally non refundable regardless of the outcome of the future research and development activities to be performed by the company 
payments from government contracts and grants are recognized as revenues as related expenses are incurred over the term of each contract or grant 
progress to completion under commercial partnerships is measured based on a comparison of the number of genes analyzed to the total number of genes to be analyzed  on a contract by contract basis 
to the extent payments received exceed revenue recognized for each contract or grant the excess portion of such payments are recorded as deferred revenues 
to the extent revenues recognized exceed payments received for each contract or grant the excess of such revenues are recorded as accounts receivable 
the company is currently recognizing revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
sab issued by the securities and exchange commission 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues 
revenues are comprised of amounts recognized under our commercial partnerships  our contract with niehs  our atp grant  two grants from nsf and a grant from the us department of energy that ended in june total revenues decreased to approximately million for the year ended 
table of contents december   as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower throughput in our genefunction factory related to work on our commercial partnership with bayer  and the expiration of our us department of energy grant in june this decrease was offset  in part  by newly generated revenues from our commercial partnership with vddi pharmaceuticals that ended in december  our contract with niehs  our atp grant and our two grants with nsf 
revenues relating to our commercial partnership with bayer decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   our commercial partnership with bayer was expanded and extended for up to an additional six years  through september  with a further two year option period through september we have completed the majority of the work under this commercial partnership and are as of december  ahead of schedule

at the end of  we were substantially ahead of schedule for the gene discovery component of our work for bayer 
under the terms of our agreement  payments from bayer for this gene discovery work are fixed and are paid quarterly regardless 
we expect that revenues related to this commercial partnership will decline in when compared to  given that most of the work currently planned has been completed 
revenues relating to our commercial partnership with monsanto decreased to approximately million for the year ended december   from approximately million for the year ended december  we expect that revenues related to this commercial partnership will remain flat in when compared to our commercial partnership with vddi pharmaceuticals commenced in february revenues for the year ended december  from this contract were approximately million 
this commercial partnership ended in december and as such will no longer contribute to our revenue 
our government contract with niehs commenced in september revenues for the year ended december  were approximately  we expect that that revenue related to this contract will increase in when compared to grant revenues increased to approximately  for the year ended december  compared to approximately  for the year ended december  grant revenues for the year ended december  were generated from our atp grant and our two new grants with nsf 
grant revenues for the year ended december  were generated from the us department of energy grant 
we are expecting that our grant revenues will increase in when compared to  due to revenues from our atp grant increasing in offset  in part  by decreases in our grant revenue from nsf as one of the grants ended in december and the other ends in june research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  including the recognition of deferred compensation  costs of supplies  facility costs  license fees and depreciation of laboratory equipment 
research and development expenses decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  of this decrease  approximately million was due to lower personnel costs related to a decrease in the number of research and development staff  approximately million was due to lower supplies costs  approximately million was due to lower consulting fees paid  approximately was due to the lower amortization of deferred compensation  and approximately million was due to lower depreciation expenses 
these decreases were offset in part  by approximately million increase in facilities costs  approximately million in repairs and maintenance expenses and approximately million in license fees 
during our operations were reorganized to better enable us to focus our resources on our core business opportunities  resulting in a reduction in our research and development expenses 
all related costs were incurred and expensed

we are expecting selling  general and administrative expense to decrease in compared to as we continue to realize the benefits of our cost cutting initiatives undertaken in divestiture 
during february we sold our plant genotyping business  paragen  to dna landmarks 
we are reporting the operating losses from paragen  the related write off of goodwill and associated assets  offset in part by approximately  of proceeds from the sale as loss from discontinued operations of million 
we are expecting a minimal income contribution from discontinued operations as we recognize royalties from the sale during we purchased paragen in from celera for  shares of our common stock  which were subsequently registered for resale on an s registration statement 
stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense represents the amortization of deferred compensation related to stock options granted during to employees at an exercise price below the estimated fair value of our common stock at the date of grant 
deferred compensation is amortized over the vesting period of the related stock options  which is generally four years

interest income expense net  increased to an expense of approximately  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to a reduction in interest earned on our cash balances offset by a decrease in our interest expense 
we expect that net interest expense will continue to increase as we use our cash balances to fund our operations and service our debt 
net loss 
net loss increased to approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in the net loss was primarily due to a decrease in revenues between the two periods and the loss from discontinued operations related to paragen  offset in part by savings related to lower research and development costs and lower selling  general and administrative costs

table of contents forward looking statements our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations and other statements contained in this report are forward looking and involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors 
we believe that our existing cash and investment securities and anticipated cash flow from existing revenue sources will be sufficient to support our current operating plan into we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong 
it is possible that we may seek additional funding within this time frame 
we may raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot assure you that additional funding  if sought  will be available or  even if available  will be available on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the number  breadth and progress of our research programs the achievement of the milestones under certain of our existing commercial partnerships our ability to establish additional and maintain current and additional commercial partnerships our commercial partners success in commercializing products developed under our commercial partnership agreements our success in commercializing products to which we have retained the rights under our commercial partnerships the costs incurred in enforcing and defending our patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our products

these risks include  but are not limited to  our early stage of development  history of net losses  technological and product development uncertainties  reliance on research collaborations  uncertainty of additional funding and ability to protect our patents and proprietary rights 
these and other risks are discussed below in part i  of this report  titled business risk factors 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while  at the same time  maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short and long term investments in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
the company s investments consist of securities of various types and maturities of five years or less  with a maximum average maturity of three years 
these securities are classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as part of accumulated other comprehensive income 
gains and losses on investment security transactions are reported on the specific identification method 
dividend and interest income are recognized when earned 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and establishes a new cost basis for the security 
the securities held in the company s investment portfolio are subject to interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates affect the fair market value of the available for sale securities 
a rise in interest rates would have an adverse impact on the fair market value of fixed rate securities 
if interest rates fall  floating rate securities may generate less interest income 
the company manages its exposure to interest rate risks through investing in securities with maturities of five years  or less 
additionally  the company is exposed to risk from changes in interest rates as a result of its borrowing activities 
at december   the company had total debt of million 
the company s debt consists of equipment financing loans with approximately million outstanding  with interest rates ranging from to  and capital lease obligations of approximately  outstanding  with effective interest rates ranging from to 
see notes and of notes to financial statements 
paradigm was not exposed to material market risks associated with activities in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  or commodity instruments as of the year ended december
