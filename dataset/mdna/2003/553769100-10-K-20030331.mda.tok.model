the following financial information reflects the reclassification  due to their increasing significance  of promotional allowances from expenses to a deduction from total revenues 
unless stated otherwise  references to total revenues  revenues and gross profit are before deducting promotional allowances 
these reclassifications do not affect net income or ebitda 
overview through subsidiaries  we own and operate the mountaineer racetrack gaming resort in chester  west virginia and the ramada inn and speedway casino in north las vegas  nevada 
since acquiring mountaineer in  we have focused our business on its operations and expect mountaineer to continue to account for the majority of our revenues and profits for the foreseeable future 
in addition  in order to leverage our expertise and capitalize on new development opportunities  we are expanding our racing operations to pennsylvania and ohio 
in the event these states enact new gaming laws  like those in west virginia that permit slot machines at racetracks  we would expect our racing facilities in these states to benefit greatly from the addition of slot machines 
we recently obtained a license to build a new thoroughbred horse racetrack with parimutuel wagering in erie  pennsylvania 
construction of the new thoroughbred horse racetrack facility at presque isle downs is expected to cost approximately million 
if legislation is passed in pennsylvania legalizing slot machines at racetracks  then we will spend significantly more up to million  exclusive of gaming equipment to also develop a gaming area 
additionally  we expect to spend approximately million exclusive of closing costs for acquisition of real property for the new racetrack 
we plan to build the new horse racetrack and commence operations as soon as practicable  subject to favorable resolution of a pending judicial review of our license  the ability to obtain clear title to the property to which our license relates and which we currently have under option and other construction related risks 
on december   we entered into a merger agreement with scioto downs  inc  which owns and operates a harness horse racing facility with parimutuel wagering in columbus  ohio 
since introducing slot machines at mountaineer in  we have achieved strong  consistent growth in revenues and ebitda 
our total revenues have increased more than tenfold  from million in to million in during this period  the number of slot machines operated at mountaineer increased from to  similarly our ebitda has grown from million in to million in our growth continues to remain strong as our total revenues and ebitda for the year ended december  grew and  respectively  over despite operating disruptions from recently completed expansion projects  including  among other things  a new room luxury hotel 
we attribute much of this increase not only to increases in the number of slot machines operated  but also to periodic legislative enhancements that have permitted more popular types of games and  most recently  higher wagering limits 
we expect that our recent investments in infrastructure and amenities  which allow us to provide our patrons a higher quality  diversified gaming and entertainment experience  will continue to drive growth in our revenues and ebitda 
to this end  we will seek to broaden our customer base by expanding our marketing campaign to promote mountaineer as a destination hotel  convention and resort facility with the addition of our new luxury hotel and convention center 
results of operations we anticipate that mountaineer park  particularly gaming operations  will continue to be the dominant factor in our financial condition 
increases in the number of slot machines and periodic legislative enhancements that have permitted more popular types of games and  most recently  higher wagering limits  as well as the investment in infrastructure an amenities  allow mountaineer park to provide patrons a high quality  diversified gaming and entertainment experience in a resort atmosphere 
although mountaineer park achieved revenue growth in excess of during  disruption from construction and inefficiencies inherent in commencing new operations affected margins 
nevertheless  management continues to believe that efficiencies will improve incrementally as the business related to the new amenities matures

on december   we entered into a merger agreement to acquire scioto downs  inc  which owns and operates a harness horse racing facility with parimutuel wagering in columbus  ohio 
we agreed to pay per share  in cash  for the  outstanding shares of scioto downs common stock 
each scioto downs shareholder may elect to receive  instead of the per share amount  an amount per share equal to plus ten annual contingent earnout payments commencing the first calendar year in which scioto downs is permitted to conduct new forms of gaming based upon of the growth of scioto downs ebitda compared to the average of scioto downs ebitda for the three years ended october  management estimates that these payments would aggregate approximately million  assuming all shareholders elected to receive cash  and would be initially less if some shareholders elected to receive the earnout payments 
management expects to finance such payments with cash flow from operations  cash on hand  and availability under our proposed million third amended and restated revolving credit facility 
the company has completed its due diligence investigation of scioto downs and has elected to proceed with the transaction subject to the remaining terms  conditions and governmental approvals 
the merger is expected to result in an increase in parimutuel and food and beverage revenues as well as an increase in related operating costs 
during  we anticipate paying approximately million in connection with the completion of the contract for the construction of our new hotel  subject to receipt of the architect s final certificate of payment and the agreement of the parties thereto 
we also have various commitments including those under various consulting agreements  operating leases  and our pension plan and union contract 
we have also entered into employment agreements with certain employees for periods ranging from one to five years 
compensation under the employment agreements consists of both cash payments and stock option commitments 
the company anticipates cash payments in the amount of approximately million exclusive of incentive payments over the next four years under the employment agreements

see the section entitled business risks related to our business for a description of certain circumstances that may affect our sources of liquidity 
we may also expand our current stock repurchase plan to permit us to repurchase our common stock in amounts and at times determined by our board of directors from time to time 
although we have no current plans to do so  we may also finance our expansion through the public or private sale of additional debt or equity securities 
our level of indebtedness presents other risks to investors  including the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness when due  and that we may not be able to meet tests and covenants of such debt agreements and achieve satisfactory resolution of such non compliance with the lenders 
in such an event  the holders of our indebtedness may be able to declare all indebtedness owing to them to be due and payable immediately  and proceed against any collateral securing such indebtedness 
these actions could limit our ability to borrow additional funds and would likely have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
a debt rating downgrade would not impact the terms of borrowings under our expected third amended and restated credit facility or the senior notes 
however  a debt rating downgrade could impact the terms of and our ability to obtain additional new financing

outstanding options 
as of march   there were outstanding options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock 
if all such options were exercised  we would receive proceeds of approximately million 
we utilize the treasury stock method in determining the dilutive effect of outstanding options and warrants 
our policy is as follows our basic earnings per share eps is computed as net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighed average number of common shares outstanding during the year 
diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through stock options  warrants  and other convertible securities utilizing the treasury stock method 
diluted earnings per share is calculated by using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusted to include the potentially dilutive effect of these occurrences 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are included in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
these policies  along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by our management in their application  have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition video lottery and parimutuel revenues are recognized at the time the wagers are made and are net of winning payouts to patrons 
the distributions from these revenues are governed by the west virginia lottery commission and the west virginia racing commission 
after deduction of a administrative fee paid to the west virginia lottery commission  the mountaineer park receives of the first million of video lottery net win per year  based upon west virginia s fiscal year of july june net win in excess of the threshold  which is fixed by statute  is subject to a surcharge 
after reduction for the administrative fee and the surcharge  the net win percentage to be received by the company is 
we recognize the reduction in revenue occasioned by the surcharge and the reduction in the percentage of net win allocable to us during the period in which the net win exceeds the predetermined threshold 
accounting for the change in the net win percentage to be retained by the company in this manner ensures that revenue is being recognized when all services have been rendered and the amount is fixed or determinable 
the amended lottery act also creates a separate capital reinvestment fund for each racetrack to which the state will contribute of the surcharge attributable to each racetrack 
generally  for each dollar a racetrack expends on eligible capital improvements for the racetrack and adjacent property  the track will receive a dollar from the capital reinvestment fund 
depending upon the amount of a project  any amount expended in excess of the balance in the capital reinvestment fund may be carried forward three subsequent years 
we recognize amounts due from the capital reinvestment fund as qualifying capital expenditures are identified 
revenues from food and beverage are recognized at the time of sale and revenues from lodging are recognized on the date of stay 
other revenues are recorded at the time the services are rendered or sales are completed 
lodging  food and beverage gratuitously provided to customers are not recognized as revenues 
impairment of long lived assets and intangibles we review the carrying value of our long lived assets including goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable annually effective in for goodwill 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
fair value can be estimated utilizing a number of techniques including quoted market prices  prices for comparable assets  or other valuation processes involving estimates of cash flows  multiples of earnings or revenues 
at december   we evaluated the financial performance and the carrying value of the property and equipment at the reno property 
based upon this evaluation  we determined that the assets were impaired and wrote them down by million to estimated fair value 
in estimating fair value  we considered recent property sales  current property listings and estimates of future cash flows related to this location 
the fair value of these assets  as well as other assets  could be different using different estimates and assumptions in the valuation techniques 
the fair value at december  was reassessed based upon pending purchase offers 
we completed the sale of the reno property in at an amount that approximated its carrying value 
self insurance effective october  we began self insuring for employee health coverage

frequent players program at mountaineer members of mountaineer s frequent players program can accumulate points for wagering and other purchases that can be redeemed for tokens  lodging  food and beverage and merchandise 
based upon historical redemptions of frequent player program points  we estimate unredeemed points and record a corresponding liability 
changes in the program  increases in membership and changes in the redemption patterns of our participating patrons could cause this liability to fluctuate 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the bases used for financial reporting and income tax reporting of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we have not provided for a valuation allowance at december  because we feel that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future operations 
newly issued accounting standards in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes sfas no

 reporting the results of operations  for a disposal of a segment of a business

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our variable rate long term debt arrangements 
under our current policies  we use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes for a portion of our debt arrangements 
however  with the issuance of the fixed rate long term senior notes and repayment of the balance outstanding under the second amended and restated credit agreement in march  our exposure to interest rate changes will be limited to amounts which may be outstanding under the expected million third amended and restated credit agreement see liquidity and sources of capital 
the existing interest rate derivative expires on december  depending upon the amounts outstanding under the third amended and restated credit agreement and without consideration of interest rate derivatives designated as hedges if any  a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would result in an annual interest expense change of up to approximately  at december  the fair value of credit facilities approximates the carrying value
