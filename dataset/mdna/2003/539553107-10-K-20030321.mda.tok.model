item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto  included in item hereof 
general local financial s primary asset is the capital stock of the bank 
in pursuit of management s growth strategy  the bank focuses on increasing its commercial and consumer lending 
the bank also targets increases in noninterest income and increases in direct consumer lending 
during the fourth quarter of  the company took steps to strengthen its regulatory capital position through the issuance of million of trust preferred securities 
likewise  in two separate issuances during  the company issued a total of million additional trust preferred securities 
the trust preferred securities will be used as tier i capital to the extent allowable by regulatory guidelines 
during  the company  acting under a board authorized repurchase program  repurchased million shares or approximately of its outstanding shares of common stock 
in october  the company authorized an additional stock repurchase program under which the company would be authorized to repurchase in the open market from time to time an additional million shares 
through december   million shares have been repurchased under that program 
the purchase of any or all of such shares authorized for repurchase will be dependent on management s assessment of market conditions and may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice 
the shares repurchased by the company under the stock repurchase program are held as treasury shares 
in november  the bank completed an acquisition of us national bank  a privately held national banking association located in midwest city  oklahoma 
as of the date of purchase  us national bank had loans  deposits and liabilities of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the acquisition substantially broadened the bank s presence in the midwest city market  where it now services approximately million of deposits 
the bank s business strategy is to provide its customers with a range of banking products and services of a regional bank while retaining the appeal and level of individualized service of a community bank 
management believes that as a result of the company s strong commitment to highly personalized relationship oriented customer service  its varied products  its strategic branch locations and the long standing community presence of its managers  lending officers and branch personnel  it is well positioned to attract new customers and to increase its market share of loans and deposits 
changes in financial condition from december  to december  cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents consisting of cash  cash due from banks and interest bearing deposits with other banks amounted to million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the company manages its cash and cash equivalents based upon the company s operating  investing and financing activities 
see liquidity and capital resources 
securities 
the company views its securities available for sale as a source of asset liquidity 
liquidity is derived from this source by receipt of interest and principal payments and prepayments  by the ability to sell these securities at market prices  and by utilizing unpledged securities as collateral for borrowings 
securities are identified as either held for maturity or available for sale  based on various factors including asset liability management strategies  liquidity and profitability objectives  and regulatory requirements 
held to maturity securities are carried at cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts 
amortization or accretion of mortgage backed securities is periodically adjusted for estimated prepayments 
available for sale securities are those that may be sold prior to maturity based upon asset liability management decisions 
securities identified as available for sale are carried at fair value 
unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities  less applicable deferred taxes  are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
during  local financial s securities portfolio decreased by million 
in december  the company reclassified million or of its total securities portfolio as held to maturity  including some of its single family loans  which were securitized during the company had a net unrealized gain  net of tax  of million in its available for sale securities portfolio at december  compared to a net unrealized gain  net of tax  of million at december  the following table sets forth information regarding the carrying and market value of the company s securities at the dates indicated dollars in thousands december  carrying market carrying market carrying market value value value value value value available for sale collateralized mortgage obligations       mortgage pass through securities   us government and agency securities   municipal securities held to maturity collateralized mortgage obligations     mortgage pass through securities     us government and agency securities   municipal securities loans receivable 
net loans receivable amounted to billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
net loans receivable increased by million or during the year ended december  in keeping with its strategy  the bank grew its commercial lending portfolio but at a slower rate than prior years 
the total commercial lending portfolio grew from billion at december  to billion at december  management intends to continue its controlled growth in lending with the primary focus being on commercial lending activities that enable the bank to provide other banking services to the customers 
for additional information  see business lending activities in item hereof and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item hereof 
contractual principal repayments and interest rates 
the following table sets forth scheduled contractual amortization of the company s total loan portfolio at december   as well as the dollar amount of such loans which are scheduled to mature after one year which have fixed or adjustable interest rates 
demand loans  loans having no schedule of repayments and no stated maturity and overdraft loans are reported as due in one year or less dollars in thousands principal repayments contractually due after one in one year year through after five or less five years years residential real estate    commercial    consumer    total    of the billion of loan principal repayments contractually due after december   billion have fixed rates of interest and million have adjustable rates of interest 
all are presented net of undistributed loan proceeds 
scheduled contractual principal repayments do not reflect the actual maturities of loans 
the average maturity of loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of prepayments and  in the case of conventional mortgage loans  due on sale clauses  which generally give the bank the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event  among other things  that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current mortgage loan rates are substantially higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and  conversely  decrease when rates on existing mortgages are substantially lower than current mortgage loan rates due to refinancing of adjustable rate and fixed rate loans at lower rates 
nonperforming assets and allowance for loan losses 
nonperforming assets consisting of non accruing loans  accruing loans greater than days delinquent and foreclosed assets at december  continued at a relatively low rate  totaling million or 
of total assets  as compared to million or 
at december  although the bank is currently experiencing lower nonperforming asset rates than most of its peers  it anticipates these rates to increase as the slower national economy may have an impact on the bank s middle market commercial borrowers who typically have less ability to withstand economic downturns 
the following table presents information on the company s nonperforming assets at the dates indicated dollars in thousands december  non accruing loans      accruing loans greater than days   delinquent foreclosed assets   total nonperforming assets      total nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets as of december   the company s allowance for loan loss totaled million or of total loans 
during the year ended december   the company s net charge offs totaled million as compared with million for the year ended december  the company s process for determining the adequacy of the allowance is based on a comprehensive analysis of the institution s loan portfolio that considers all significant factors that affect the collectibility 
the allowance is maintained at a level that is adequate to absorb all estimated inherent losses in the portfolio as of this date 
specific and general valuation allowances are increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by charge offs of loans  net of recoveries 
specific allowances are provided for impaired loans for which the expected loss is measurable 
general valuation allowances are provided based on a formula  which incorporates the factors discussed above 
the bank periodically reviews the assumptions and formula by which additions are made to the specific and general valuation allowances for losses in an effort to refine such allowances in light of the current status of the factors described above 
management realizes that an institution s past loss history should be considered in evaluating the inherent loss potential of the loan portfolio 
consequently  management has deemed it prudent to develop and implement a migration analysis for the determination of inherent loss potential for both its homogeneous and nonhomogeneous loan portfolio 
homogeneous loan categories consist of one to four family residential mortgages and consumer loans 
homogeneous loans are analyzed on a group or pool basis for evaluation of credit quality and impairment under sfas no 
nonhomogeneous loan categories consist of commercial loans 
these assets are reviewed individually for the purpose of evaluating credit quality and impairment under sfas no 
the migration loss percentage factors used for each risk class or grade for both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous loan categories are based on the results of a migration analysis 
in addition to historical loss experience  the company also considers other factors likely to cause estimated credit losses to differ from historical loss experience

results of operations general 
the company s results of operations depend substantially on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  consisting primarily of loans receivable  mortgage backed and investment securities and various other short term investments  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  consisting primarily of deposits  fhlb of topeka advances  senior notes and mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities 
on an ongoing basis  the company s results of operations will be affected by the level of its noninterest income including deposit related income  loan fees and service charges  net gains losses on sales of assets and the increase in the cash surrender value of the bank owned life insurance  the level of its noninterest expense  such as compensation and employee benefits  equipment and data processing expense  occupancy expense  advertising expense and professional fees  its provisions for losses on loans resulting from the company s assessment of the adequacy of its allowance for losses on loans  and provisions for income taxes 
net income 
the company reported net income of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
included in these results are the effect of the company s purchase and retirement during  and of  million and million of senior notes  resulting in a  million and  loss  net of tax  respectively 
net income increased by million or during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to a decline in interest expense paid on deposit accounts as well as increased deposit related income 
net income increased by million or during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to the increase in the net interest income which came as a result of income earned on the company s available for sale securities portfolio as well as declining interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income 
net interest income is determined by the company s net interest spread ie  the difference between the yields earned on its interest earning assets and the rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income rose in all comparative periods presented 
the overall decline in the national economy drove interest rates to historical lows 
during  the company s interest bearing liabilities repriced faster than its interest earning assets 
accordingly  the company s net interest spread increased from in to in in all periods presented  the company has continued to increase its net interest earning assets interest earning assets less interest bearing liabilities 
average interest earning assets increased by million or during with loans being the highest yielding asset 
average interest bearing liabilities increased million or during the company s net interest margin  which is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets  decreased from for to for reflecting the slower rate of growth in net interest income during interest income 
total interest income decreased by million or during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of the decline in the average yield on interest earning assets  which fell from to or basis points during the comparative period 
interest income on loans fell million or during the year ended december  this decline was primarily due to the decline in the average yield  which dropped from to during that same period 
the company continues to increase its average balance of loans outstanding particularly focusing on growth in the commercial portfolio 
however  current economic conditions have slowed new loan origination growth and early pay offs and refinancings caused further yield declines within the portfolio as new loans are added at current lower rates 
total interest income increased marginally by million or during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  as an increase in interest income received on the securities portfolio offset a decline in interest income received on loans 
during the year ended  loan growth slowed and rates fell causing overall yield declines in the loan portfolio 
interest income on loans receivable declined million or during the year ended december  during this same period  the company s average available for sale securities portfolio increased million or 
while the average yield on the securities portfolio fell from to  the rate decline did not offset the volume increases  and accordingly  interest income on securities rose million or during the comparative periods 
interest expense 
interest expense on deposits  which is the largest component of the company s interest bearing liabilities  declined million or during the year ended december  the decreased expense was primarily rate driven as the average cost of deposits fell from to during the period  offsetting increases in the average balance of those deposits  which rose million or 
similarly  during the year ended december   interest expense on deposits declined million or when compared to the year ended december  however  this decline was a result of both rate and volume declines in the deposit base 
the average cost of deposits during the year ended december   was as compared with for the same period in the prior year 
this rate decline coupled with a decline in the average balance of total deposits of million or during the comparative period led to the overall decline in interest expense 
interest expense on fhlb advances increased million or during the year ended december  primarily due to an increase in the average outstanding balance of those borrowings  which rose from million during to million during this increase in volume offsets a decline in the average cost of those borrowings from to  respectively 
during the year ended december  volume increases again drove an increase in interest expense as compared to the prior year as the average balance of borrowings for increased million 
during this same period the average cost of those borrowings declined basis points 
interest expense on securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased during the year ended december  to  from million in the year ended december  this decline was primarily rate driven as the average yield on those borrowings fell from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  during the periods presented  interest expense on senior notes consisted of interest accrued with respect to the notes issued in connection with the purchase and recapitalization of the company 
during the past four years  the company has successfully purchased and retired million of the original million senior notes resulting in the continued decrease in interest expense 
during the fourth quarter of  the company issued million in trust preferred securities bearing an interest rate of 
likewise in july and october  the company issued an additional million in floating rate trust preferred securities  bringing the total outstanding balance of mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities at december  to million

the provision for loan losses is charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered appropriate by management based on i an estimate by management of loan losses that occurred during the current period and ii an ongoing adjustment of prior estimates of losses occurring in prior periods 
to serve as a basis for making this provision each quarter  the company maintains an extensive credit risk monitoring process that considers several factors  including among other things  current economic conditions affecting the company s customers  the payment performance of individual large loans and pools of homogeneous small loans  portfolio seasoning  changes in collateral values  and detailed reviews of specific large loan relationships 
for large loans deemed to be impaired due to an expectation that all contractual payments will probably not be received  impairment is measured by comparing the company s recorded investment in the loan to the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the fair value of the collateral or the loan s observable market price 
while management endeavors to use the best information available in making its evaluations  future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary if economic conditions change substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations 
in addition  regulatory examiners may require the bank to recognize additions to its allowance based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
the company established provisions for loan losses of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
during such respective periods  loan charge offs net of recoveries amounted to million  million and million 
noninterest income 
total noninterest income amounted to million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the components of noninterest income consist of deposit related income  loan fees and loan service charges  net gains on sale of assets  the increase in the cash surrender value of the bank owned life insurance  commission revenue and other miscellaneous income 
the million or increase in noninterest income in was due to increases in deposit related service charges as the company has placed increased emphasis on developing new sources of noninterest revenue 
the million or increase in noninterest income in was due primarily to increases in deposit related service charges as well as increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance resulting from the additional million purchased during the year 
noninterest expense 
total noninterest expense increased million or during the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to increases in compensation and employee benefits expense  which includes the cost of fully accruing the tax offsetting bonus feature of stock options issued to selected officers which was partly offset by the elimination of million in goodwill that would have been amortized in under prior accounting rules 
during the year ended  total noninterest expense increased million or 
the increase was attributable to increases in compensation and employee benefits expense as the company added personnel to support its growth strategy as well as a million pre tax loss incurred on the repurchase of million of the company s senior notes 
provision for income taxes 
during the years ended december   and  the company recognized million  million and million  respectively  of provisions for income taxes 
at december   the company had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards available for state income tax purposes 
the state net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts between and at december   and  a valuation allowance for all available state net operating loss carryforwards was established as it was determined to be more likely than not that the benefit of the deferred tax asset would not be realized 
historically  the company has generated income for federal income tax purposes 
based on the company s current strategy  no valuation allowance for other deferred tax assets has been established as the company believes it is more likely than not that sufficient income for federal income tax purposes will be realized

liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
liquidity refers to the company s ability to generate sufficient cash to meet the funding needs of current loan demand  savings deposit withdrawals  principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding borrowings and to pay operating expenses 
it is management s policy to maintain greater liquidity than required in order to be in a position to fund loan originations  to meet withdrawals from deposit accounts  to make principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding borrowings and to make investments that take advantage of interest rate spreads 
the company monitors its liquidity in accordance with guidelines established by the company and applicable regulatory requirements 
the company s need for liquidity is affected by loan demand  net changes in deposit levels and the scheduled maturities of its borrowings 
the company can minimize the cash required during the times of heavy loan demand by modifying its credit policies or reducing its marketing effort 
liquidity demand caused by net reductions in deposits are usually caused by factors over which the company has limited control 
the company derives its liquidity from both its assets and liabilities 
liquidity is derived from assets by receipt of interest and principal payments and prepayments  by the ability to sell assets at market prices and by utilizing unpledged assets as collateral for borrowings 
liquidity is derived from liabilities by maintaining a variety of funding sources  including deposits  advances from the fhlb  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short and long term borrowings 
the company s liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of funds management 
liquid assets are generally invested in short term investments such as overnight money funds and short term government agency securities 
if the company requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  various forms of both short and long term borrowings provide an additional source of funds 
at december   the company had million in available borrowing capacity with the fhlb 
at december   the company had outstanding loan commitments including unused lines of credit for home equity  commercial real estate and commercial business loans of approximately million and an additional million in performance standby letters of credit 
certificates of deposit  which are scheduled to mature within one year  totaled million at december   and borrowings  which are scheduled to mature within the same period totaled million 
the company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan commitments and that  based upon past experience and current pricing policies  it can adjust the rates of certificates of deposit to retain a substantial portion of its maturing certificates and also  to the extent deemed necessary  refinance any maturing borrowings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of the repricing of assets and liabilities 
it is the objective of the company to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  management s strategy is to match asset and liability balances within maturity categories to limit the company s exposure to earnings variations and variations in the value of assets and liabilities as interest rates change over time 
the company s asset and liability management strategy is formulated and monitored by the asset liability management committee  which is comprised of the chief executive officer  the president  the chief financial officer  the director of retail operations and the portfolio manager of the company  in accordance with policies approved by the board of directors of the company 
the asset liability management committee meets monthly or as needed to review  among other things  the sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  including those attributable to hedging transactions  purchase and sale activity  and maturities and prepayments of loans  investments and borrowings 
the asset liability management committee also approves and establishes pricing and funding decisions with respect to overall asset and liability composition and reports to the board of directors 
one of the primary goals of the company s asset liability management committee is to effectively increase the duration of the company s liabilities and or effectively contract the duration of the company s assets so that the respective durations are matched as closely as possible 
this duration adjustment can be accomplished either internally by restructuring the company s statement of financial condition  or externally by adjusting the duration of the company s assets and or liabilities through the use of hedging contracts  such as interest rate swaps  caps and floors 
the company s current strategy is to hedge internally through the use of core transaction deposit accounts which are not as rate sensitive as other deposit instruments and fhlb advances  together with an emphasis on investing in shorter term or adjustable rate assets which are more responsive to changes in interest rates  such as us government agency mortgage backed securities with variable maturities  short term us government agency securities and commercial and consumer loans 
the foregoing strategies are more fully described below 
a commonly used method for evaluating interest rate risk includes an analysis of the interest rate sensitivity gap  which is defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
normally  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
due to differences between institutions statements of financial condition  these variances may affect institutions differently 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if an institution were perfectly matched in each maturity category 
the following table summarizes the anticipated maturities or repricing of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december   based on the information and assumptions set forth in the notes below dollars in thousands more than three to more than three years within three twelve one year to to five over five months months three years years years total interest earning assets loans receivable       securities available for sale       held to maturity       other interest earning assets   total       interest bearing liabilities deposits money market and now accounts       passbook accounts       certificates of deposit       fhlb advances     securities sold under agreements to repurchase   senior notes   mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities    total       excess deficiency of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities       cumulative excess of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities       cumulative excess of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities as a percent of total assets adjustable rate loans and securities are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they mature and fixed rate loans and securities are included in the periods in which they are scheduled to be repaid  based on scheduled amortization  in each case as adjusted to take into account estimated prepayments based on  among other things  historical performance 
balances have been reduced for nonaccrual loans 
does not include unrealized gain on securities classified as available for sale 
comprised of cash and due from banks  deposits with other banks  fhlb stock and federal reserve bank stock 
adjusted to take into account assumed annual decay rates  which were applied against money market  now and passbook accounts 
additionally  adjustable rate trust preferred securities are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they mature  while fixed rate trust preferred securities are included in the period in which they are scheduled to mature 
although interest rate sensitivity gap is a useful measurement and contributes toward effective asset and liability management  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates based solely on that measure 
as a result  the asset liability management committee also regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and economic value of equity eve  which is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  and evaluating such impacts against the maximum potential changes in net interest income and eve that is authorized by the board of directors of the company 
the following tables set forth for the indicated dates the estimated dollar and percentage change in the company s net interest income over a four quarter period and eve based on the indicated changes in interest rates assuming an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities 
december  december  net interest income net interest income next four quarters next four quarters estimated estimated change in basis change change points in interest from base change from base change rates s from base s from base december  december  eve eve estimated estimated change in basis change change points in interest from base change from base change rates s from base s from base the base net interest income is an estimate made by utilizing yields and rates on assets and liabilities in the existing statement of financial condition as of the dates shown adjusted for assumptions based on  among other things  future loan and deposit changes and estimated loan prepayment speeds 
the decrease in net interest income nii for the next four quarters when projected as of december  as compared to the projections as of december  in the base case is mainly due to a drop in overall market interest rates that decreases net interest margin and to a decrease in forecasted interest earning assets 
the increased sensitivity in the nii as projected in the down shocks is largely due to the drop in market rates to levels that prevent certain deposit and borrowing rates to decline the full basis points assumed in the shock thereby squeezing net interest income 
the decrease in eve from december  to december  in the base case is primarily due to an increase in the market value of the convertible fixed rate fhlb advances caused by the drop in market rates and the repurchase of local financial stock 
the increased sensitivity in the eve shocks is principally caused by three factors i the increased duration of deposits at december  due to the low rate environment  ii the duration extension of the convertible fixed rate fhlb advances that occurs as market rates drop and iii the decline in duration of mortgage backed securities due to increased prepayments caused by lower residential market rates 
the model reflects only the effects of assumptions made by management while running the different interest rate shocks 
the only variables between the different rate shocks are the interest rates  prepayment speeds and the rate of replacement for prepaying securities 
the prepayment assumptions used in the model are based on historical and market estimates 
standard present value calculation methodology is used to discount the estimated future cash flows of assets and liabilities at appropriate discount rates 
management of the company believes that the assumptions used by it to evaluate the vulnerability of the company s operations to changes in interest rates are reasonable  however  the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities and the estimated effects of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and eve could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or actual experience differs from the historical experience on which they are based 
the preceding discussion about the company s risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements
