overview the company develops  manufactures and markets immunoassay and bioluminescence based test kits for rapid and cost effective detection of a wide variety of substances in the food safety and water quality markets through its test kit segment 
through its antibody segment  the company also provides antibody and immunoreagent research  development and production services 
since its inception  the company and its predecessors have  in addition to conducting internal research and development of new products  entered into research and development agreements with multiple corporate partners that have led to the introduction of various products to the food safety  water quality and other markets 
the company expects that internal research and development projects  primarily in the food safety area  will continue to represent a larger percentage of its research and development expenditures 
the company believes that its competitive position has been enhanced through the combination of talent  technology and resources resulting from the relationships it developed and the acquisitions it concluded during the past five years 
these relationships and acquisitions have enabled the company to achieve meaningful economies of scale for the unique products it offers through the utilization of its consolidated facilities in newark  delaware  for the manufacture of test kits and antibodies  its facility located in oceanside  california  for the manufacture of instruments  and its facility located in windham  maine for the manufacture of antibodies 
on july   the company purchased certain assets of molecular circuitry  inc mci 
the purchased assets consist primarily of various proprietary growth media technology that will be used in combination with the company s diagnostic tests for food borne pathogens  including salmonella and e 
coli 
the assets purchased also include the sales and marketing rights to the ruminant feed test product line that the company and mci had been jointly developing in collaboration with mcdonald s corporation 
in consideration for these and other related assets  the company issued to mci  unregistered shares of the company s common stock with a value of per share or million in the aggregate  computed by averaging the closing price of the company s common stock on the nasdaq national market for the period beginning two business days before the acquisition and ending two business days after the acquisition  plus an additional  in transaction related costs 
in addition  the company will pay mci a continuing royalty for years on sales of specified products and or components of products  which royalty will be charged to operations if and when incurred 
on september   the company acquired azur environmental azur  a privately held manufacturer of proprietary rapid test systems  including the microtox r toxicity test system  which measures toxicity in drinking and process water 
mentioned in more than peer reviewed scientific articles and with more than  instruments sold worldwide  the microtox r toxicity test system has been approved in regulations or standards in canada  eight european countries  and has been submitted to the us environmental protection agency for approval 
under the terms of the merger agreement with azur  the company issued  shares of series c preferred stock  with a fair market value of approximately million in the aggregate  as determined by an independent valuation firm 
on november  the  series c preferred shares were automatically converted into  shares of the company s common stock in accordance with their original terms 
with the acquisitions of hti bioproducts  inc and certain assets of atlantic antibodies  the company formed a new operating segment  strategic biosolutions  which has now become one of the largest producers of antibodies in the united states 
the mission of strategic biosolutions is to supply monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies  immunochemical reagents and related services to medical diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies  as well as research institutions 
the company believes that its products in the food safety and water quality testing markets are unique and fill potentially large  unmet needs for rapid  easy to use analytical methods 
the company also believes that its products and technology currently being developed have broad application in diverse markets including the food and beverage and water treatment industries 
the company believes that its established product base  quality manufacturing expertise  experienced sales and marketing organization  established network of distributors  corporate partner relationships and proven research and development expertise will be critical elements of its potential future success 
revenues in any particular quarter may not be indicative of revenues for any subsequent quarter during the year  or for the entire year 
with the anticipated increase in sales of the company s microtox r test systems these tests are generally not affected by seasonal patterns and as sales of food safety products in the us and to other parts of the world develop over the next few years  the company expects its seasonal and other fluctuations in revenues and other operating results to become gradually less pronounced 
results of operations year ended december  versus year ended december  revenues net revenues decreased million or in over the following table sets out revenues by business segment and market category 
in thousands year ended increase percent decrease change kit segment water quality   food safety    contract and other total kit revenues    antibody segment   total net revenues    revenues for the water quality category increased slightly in  primarily due to increasing sales of the microtox r toxicity screening systems  with more than north american water systems  most of which serve more than  households  utilizing the system for drinking water 
the company acquired the microtox r test systems in september  after distributing this product since early the company continues to work with customers as they assess their vulnerability to threats of intentional contamination as currently required under us law and is expanding its efforts to market its microtox r test systems to potential customers in the food and beverage industry 
the increase in microtox r sales has been somewhat offset by a decrease in sales of tests in the remediation market 
sales in this category have been slower due to weak general economic conditions 
the company expects water quality revenues to grow in  particularly due to increased demand for microtox r and its attendant consumables as water processors and end users have a heightened awareness of the potential threat of chemical contamination  intentional or otherwise 
food safety revenues decreased primarily due to the significant decline in of starlink r test kit sales from record sales levels in as the removal of starlink r corn from the nation s grain supply commenced late in starlink r  which was approved only for non food uses  was discovered in food products in and resulted in the need for growers  handlers  processors  shippers and exporters to test corn for the presence of starlink r 
the company believes that reliance on genetically modified organism gmo technology continues to grow both in the us and abroad  and that as a result demand for the company s testing products  other than tests for starlink r  will increase as well 
sales of company s gmo tests for cottonseed increased during and the company believes it now supplies every major cottonseed company in terms of seed sales in the us many countries outside the us and canada have adopted labeling regulations that could stimulate demand  as well as food manufacturers developing protocols to comply with these regulations 
since the july launch of the rapidchek r lateral flow test for e 
coli o  several field evaluations have been performed by major independent laboratories 
the results from these evaluations have prompted a globally recognized food safety laboratory corporation to begin a nationwide implementation of the rapidchek r e 
coli o test method into its testing protocols 
this corporation expects its implementation to be complete by the end of march also  a leading global foodservice provider has completed an in depth study of the rapidchek r e 
coli o test method 
according to statements made by the foodservice provider  the findings of this study revealed that laboratories performing the rapidchek r test found a reduction in overall false positives when compared to a well recognized competitive test  and that rapidchek r showed greater sensitivity and was easier to use than the competitive brand 
this foodservice provider has endorsed the use of rapidchek r tests for e 
coli o testing by its meat suppliers 
several of these meat suppliers initiated use of rapidchek r in january another significant evaluation performed by a us regulatory agency has shown that the rapidchek r e 
coli o growing media performs better than other leading brands in either hour or hour methods 
based on the foregoing  the company expects to attract a meaningful share of the growing e 
coli testing market 
in january the company commercially launched its newest food pathogen test to detect salmonella in food 
salmonella testing is the most common test performed on a wide variety of foods including meats  dairy and processed foods 
the company s new test has several advantages over competitive methods including a simplified preparation process that makes the test easier to perform versus competitive brands 
the product s performance standard meets all necessary regulatory requirements 
the company has submitted the salmonella test for third party validation by the american organization of analytical chemists research institute aoac and plans are currently underway for key evaluations with major food companies and laboratories 
the company expects to complete a licensing agreement of a lateral flow reading instrument to read and record test results from all of its lateral flow tests  including the lateral flow test used to detect salmonella 
in february the company released its screening test for the detection of meat and bone meal in animal feed  which is linked to the transmission of bse  commonly known as mad cow disease 
this test  known as feedcheck tm  was designed in a lateral flow format to be more sensitive and easier to use than other rapid  on site methods 
compared to certain competitive products  this test does not require weighing or boiling of samples 
by eliminating these steps  the feedcheck tm test is faster  easier to use and will not require equipment such as scales and heating devices 
the method for animal feed has been designed with multiple tests per strip to address the various analytical requirements throughout the world 
the feedcheck tm product has been shown to detect as little as bovine meat and bone meal in feed 
these product features are important to comply with customer specifications and governmental regulations throughout the us  europe and japan 
the test was developed in collaboration with molecular circuitry  inc and sponsored by mcdonald s corporation 
additionally  the company s research and product development efforts are continuing toward the completion of new products  including tests for the food pathogen listeria 
contract and other revenue declined as the company continued to place greater emphasis on devoting its research and development resources on internal projects  particularly in the food safety category 
antibody segment revenues declined slightly in as the company completed the consolidation of its san diego  california  operations into a single site at its maine location during several new or expanded relationships were established during as customers and prospects had the opportunity to validate manufacturing and quality procedures at the expanded manufacturing facilities in maine 
the company believes that these relationships will develop into increasing sales  as the antibody division earns additional projects under these relationships 
the company s project to develop a point of treatment diagnostic test for bayer s new product repinotan tm is continuing  with bayer s phase iii clinical trials expected to be completed during operating expenses operating expenses decreased million or in  due primarily to lower manufacturing expenses  as a result of lower starlink r related sales volume in gross profits total revenues less manufacturing costs decreased million or to million and gross margins declined to in from in the decline in gross margins is primarily attributable to the fact that the company s utilization of its manufacturing capacity was reduced as compared to  a result of lower sales volume during  resulting primarily from reduced starlink r related sales 
the company instituted several initiatives late in the fourth quarter and early in the first quarter to leverage its manufacturing capacity and improve its production yields 
one such effort is the elimination of separate test kit and antibody business units  resulting in a single manufacturing organization 
with a single manufacturing organization  the company believes it will be able to increase the productivity of its staff and reduce the administrative duties through a flatter organizational structure 
gross margins are expected to improve in  when the benefits of the company s efficiency initiatives are realized  and several new products in the food safety category are expected to be introduced to the market 
in addition  the company will have the full year affect of the expense savings from the consolidation of the antibody operation in maine 
research and development expenses increased  or  primarily due to continued investment in the animal feed test and the lateral flow food pathogen tests 
these expenses will remain about the same in as the company continues the development and introduction of new food safety products 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately the same in the year as in these expenses are expected to decline in as the company has stepped up its efforts to streamline its operations  including creating a single sales and marketing organization  which had previously been organized in three distinct teams in the water quality  food safety and antibody product categories 
the company believes that its new sales organization structure is more efficient and will be more effective in addressing all of the company s market opportunities 
other income in  the company sold most of the remaining assets of its antibody production facility near san diego  california 
the company recorded a gain on sale of  which represents the amount the company received above the carrying value of the assets sold 
also during  the company reached an agreement with its insurance carrier in settlement of costs related to a building fire on its maine property 
the company recorded a gain on disposal of  which represents the amount the company received above its investment in the assets destroyed

in thousands year ended increase percent decrease change kit segment water quality    food safety    contract and other  total kit revenues    antibody segment   total net revenues    water quality revenue growth was primarily attributable to strong demand since the events of september  for the company s general screening test for chemical toxicity  microtox r  which was acquired during in connection with the acquisition of azur environmental 
in the period from september  through december   the company sold approximately microtox r units primarily to the drinking water industry as a means to detect the presence of toxic concentrations of chemicals in water supplies 
revenues from the sale of these units and their attendant consumables were approximately million during the september  through december  period 
food safety revenue growth is primarily due to increased sales of tests to detect gmos in plants  seeds  grain and intermediate food products including tests to detect starlink r in corn 
antibody revenue declined slightly in as the company began consolidating its operations into a single site at its maine location during contract and other revenue declined as the company continued to place greater emphasis on devoting its research and development resources on internal projects particularly in the food safety category 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million  or  in this increase included additional costs of the consolidation of the california and maine facilities of  test kit inventory adjustments of approximately  and  of costs for a retainer and fees 
the consolidation expenses include relocation  moving  startup and severance expenses incurred in connection with the winding down of antibody production facilities in california and the startup of combined operations at its windham  maine facilities 
of these expenses  approximately  were related to manufacturing expenses associated with the closing and startup of the antibody facilities and the balance were selling  general and administrative expenses primarily associated with the relocation to windham  maine 
the inventory adjustments resulted from a computational and procedural error that resulted in higher inventory values 
these items were identified as the company completed its accounting for the fiscal year 
to correct this error  inventory was reduced by  and manufacturing expenses were increased by  the retainer and related fees relates to an engagement of an investment bank to explore strategic alternatives 
this engagement commenced in july for a one year term

manufacturing expenses increased million  or  to million 
after the effect of the  adjustment for the maine consolidation and the  inventory adjustment described above  manufacturing expenses increased million  or  from the year earlier period 
this increase is primarily attributable to increased sales in and the increased costs attendant to the consolidation of the antibody facilities  which required the company to run certain duplicative operations to facilitate the transition 
gross profits total revenues less manufacturing costs increased  or  to million and gross margins declined to in from in after giving effect to the adjustments in described above  gross profits increased  or  and gross margins declined to in from in the decline in gross margins is attributable to the increased costs of production during the transition of the antibody manufacturing facilities from california to maine as described above  and lower selling prices for certain products in the food safety category at substantially higher volumes in research and development expenses were approximately the same in the year as in selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or  to million

based upon its cash on hand  credit facilities  current product sales and the anticipated sales of new products  the company believes it has  or has access to  sufficient resources to meet its operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company s ability to meet its long term capital needs will depend on a number of factors  including compliance with existing and new loan covenants  the success of its current and future products  the focus and direction of its research and development program  competitive and technological advances  future relationships with corporate partners  government regulation  the company s marketing and distribution strategy  its successful sale of additional common stock and or the company s successfully locating and obtaining other financing  and the success of the company s plan to make future acquisitions 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to meet the future liquidity requirements that may arise from these inherent and similar uncertainties 
accounting standards critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  deferred taxes  long lived assets and contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the company believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the consolidated results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
valuation of accounts receivable accounts receivable as of december  and december   were net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  respectively 
the recorded allowance is continually evaluated based on current market conditions  an analysis of customer specific facts and circumstances  and the size and composition of the overall portfolio 
if receivables become uncollectible  these write offs are charged against the allowance 
valuation of inventories inventories  which consist primarily of test kit components  bulk antibody serum and antibody products are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
realization of inventories is dependent upon the successful marketing of our products 
judgments are made regarding the carrying value of inventory based on current market conditions 
market conditions may change depending upon competitive product introductions and customer demand 
if market conditions change or if the introduction of new products by the company impacts the market for previously released products  the company may be required to write down the cost of its inventory 
deferred taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax items are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences  net of the existing valuation allowances at december  at december   management has concluded that a full valuation allowance is necessary for deferred tax assets in certain state jurisdictions and the entire balance of foreign deferred tax assets 
revenue recognition product related sales are composed of the sale of immunoassay and bioluminescence based test kits and the sale of antibodies and immunochemical reagents 
the sale of all immunoassay and bioluminescence based test kits  bulk antibodies and immunochemical reagents are recognized upon the shipment of the product and transfer of title or when related services are provided 
for the twelve months ended december   and these sales represented  and of total company revenues  respectively 
sales of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies under customer contracts and purchase orders are recognized under the percentage of completion method and are recorded based on the percentage of costs or time incurred through the reporting date versus the estimate for the complete contract or project 
the company recognizes revenues in this manner as production of these types of antibodies generally takes between two and twelve months to complete and costs are incurred throughout the production process 
for the twelve months ended december   and these sales represented  and of total company revenues  respectively 
contract revenues are recognized upon the completion of contractual milestones 
for the twelve months ended december   and these sales represented  and of total company revenues 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
new accounting standards and disclosures in june  the fasb issued sfas no
