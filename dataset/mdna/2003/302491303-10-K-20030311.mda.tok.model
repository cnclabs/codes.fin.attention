item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our company we are a diversified  global chemical company providing innovative solutions and applications to a wide variety of end markets 
we operate in three business segments agricultural products  specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals 
agricultural products principal focus is on insecticides  which are used to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a wide spectrum of pests  and on herbicides  which are used to reduce the need for manual or mechanical weeding by inhibiting or preventing weed growth 
specialty chemicals consists of our biopolymers and lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture  structure and physical stability  pharmaceutical additives for binding and disintegrant use and lithium specialties for pharmaceutical synthesis and energy storage 
our industrial chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials  including soda ash  peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals 
agricultural products our agricultural products segment manufactures and sells proprietary  branded insecticides and herbicides 
we have a strong position in two widely used classes of insecticides  pyrethroids and carbamates  and possess a niche portfolio of proprietary herbicides 
these products are used for the protection of cotton  corn  rice  cereals  vegetables and other crops 
in addition in north america we sell into the professional pest control and home and garden markets 
we differentiate ourselves through a highly focused strategy in selected crops and regions  and by leveraging proprietary chemistries and pest specific research and development r d to develop and market new insecticides and new applications of our existing products 
we have also developed strategic alliances with companies such as ishihara sangyo kaisha  ltd 
isk  a japanese crop protection company  to access new markets and develop new insecticides 
specialty chemicals our specialty chemicals segment is comprised of our biopolymers and lithium businesses 
biopolymer manufactures and sells microcrystalline cellulose  carrageenan and alginates  products that add texture  structure and physical stability to a wide range of beverage  dairy  meat and bakery products and or that act as binders and disintegrants for tablets and capsules 
our lithium business is a technology based business in which mined lithium is processed and sold for use in a broad array of specialty products  including pharmaceuticals  specialty polymers and energy storage devices 
the majority of specialty chemicals sales are to customers engaged in non cyclical end markets  such as food and pharmaceuticals 
industrial chemicals our industrial chemicals segment manufactures soda ash  peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals 
through our manufacturing facility in green river  wyoming  we process naturally occurring soda ash  a commonly used ingredient in detergents and chemical processing and an essential ingredient in glass 
we produce hydrogen peroxide  leveraging our geographically advantaged plant locations throughout north america to reach our customers 
we also market specialty grades of hydrogen peroxide and specialty peroxygens to the electronics  polymers and food processing industries 
our european subsidiary  fmc foret  sa foret  leverages its low production costs and strong brand name to manufacture and sell phosphorus chemicals  peroxygens  sulfur derivatives  silicates  zeolites and other products in europe  africa and the middle east 
we are also a percent owner with solutia  inc solutia of astaris llc astaris  a north american producer of phosphorus chemicals used in a wide array of markets  including the detergent  food  agricultural and industrial markets 
we account for astaris as an equity investment 
the majority of industrial chemicals sales are to customers engaged in relatively non cyclical end markets 
the reorganization of our company we implemented our plan to split fmc into separate chemical and machinery companies in through a two step process 
the first step included an initial public offering ipo of percent of fmc technologies  inc technologies  which took place in the second quarter of technologies consists of our former energy systems and food and transportation systems business segments 
subsequent to the ipo  technologies made net payments of million to fmc in exchange for the net assets distributed to technologies on june   which we used to retire short term and long term debt 
the second step  the distribution of our remaining percent ownership in technologies the spin off occurred on december  total net assets distributed on december  were million 
we believe that the spin off of technologies has allowed us to focus our efforts in the chemical industry through improved customer orientation  increased innovation and overall growth in certain businesses 
in an effort to align our business with our future growth plans  we took various strategic measures in  and  including the restructuring of businesses  reduction of staff  plant shut downs  plant mothballing and the impairment of certain underperforming assets 
we believe these steps will increase our financial flexibility as operating conditions change 
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of asset  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we have described our accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
we have reviewed these accounting policies  identifying those which we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements 
we have reviewed with the audit committee those accounting policies that we have deemed critical 
critical accounting policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  current conditions and other reasonable factors 
environmental we provide for environmental related obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated 
where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability  that estimate has been used 
where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other  the lower end of the range has been used 
estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the us environmental protection agency epa  or similar government agencies  are generally accrued no later than when a record of decision rod  or equivalent  is issued  or upon completion of a remedial investigation feasibility study ri fs that is accepted by fmc and the appropriate government agency or agencies 
estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management  as well as by our financial and legal management and  if necessary  adjusted as additional information becomes available 
the estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination  required remediation methods  and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 
our liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation and or study of sites at which our company is alleged to have disposed of hazardous substances 
such costs principally include  among other items  ri fs  site remediation  costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan  fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort  and future monitoring costs 
estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies  specific site consultants engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites 
provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income  net of probable and estimable recoveries from named potentially responsible parties prps or other third parties 
such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values 
in calculating and evaluating the adequacy of its environmental reserves  the company has taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and the analogous state laws on all prps and has considered the identity and financial condition of each of the other prps at each site to the extent possible 
we also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated  as well as the status of our claims against such parties 
although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of prps and other third parties with absolute certainty  the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a site by site basis 
our liability includes management s best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before its consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties 
we believe that any recorded recoveries related to prps are realizable in all material respects 
we have recorded recoveries in environmental reserves  continuing and discontinued  representing probable realization of claims against insurance companies  us government agencies and other third parties  of million and million  respectively  at december  and these recoveries are recorded as an offset to the environmental reserve  continuing and discontinued 
cash recoveries for the years  and were million  million and million  respectively 
we expect to continue to receive payments for recoveries in the future 
our total environmental reserves  before recoveries  totaled million and million at december   and  respectively 
in addition  at december  we have estimated that reasonably possible environmental loss contingencies may exceed amounts accrued by as much as million 
impairments and valuation of long lived assets our long lived assets include property  plant and equipment and long term investments  goodwill and intangible assets 
we review the carrying value of these assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the standard requires that we test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition 
in cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets 
the fair value of long lived assets is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable 
the estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices  volumes  costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time 
we recognized million and million in asset impairments in and  respectively  related to our industrial chemicals and specialty chemicals segments 
we also prepare an annual impairment test of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets is based on estimated discounted cash flows 
the assumptions used to estimate fair value include management s best estimate of future growth rates  discount rates and market conditions over a reasonable period 
we performed this test in and determined that no impairment charge was required 
total goodwill as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
depreciation for financial reporting is reported on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the fixed asset 
estimated useful lives are based on historical useful life trends as well as common industry practice 
useful lives are as follows years land improvements  to years buildings depending on location and use  to years machinery and equipment depending on type and use 
depreciation expense totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
pension and other postretirement benefits we provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans  as well as other postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees 
the costs or benefits and obligations related to these benefits reflect our key assumptions related to general economic conditions  including interest discount rates  healthcare cost trend rates  expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increases for employees 
the costs or benefits and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions  including things such as the average retirement age  mortality tables  employee turnover  and plan participation 
to the extent our plans actual experience  as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans demographics  differs from these assumptions  the costs and obligations for providing these benefits  as well as the plans funding requirements  could increase or decrease 
when actual results differ from our assumptions  the difference is typically recognized over future periods 
we use certain calculated values of assets under methods permitted under sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions  sfas both to estimate the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans funding requirements 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a market related value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a five year period 
we use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans funding requirements 
the actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range  high or low  of the actual market value of assets  and is adjusted accordingly 
the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may affect periodic benefit costs in future periods  however  we do not expect this to have a significant impact in we recorded million and million of pension and other postretirement benefit cost in and  respectively  and a million credit in pension and other postretirement benefit cost in we expect pension and other postretirement benefit costs to increase in  due to a combination of factors  including changes in key assumptions such as the discount rate and an increase in the amortization of prior service cost 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  was recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
the recorded amounts for pension benefit obligations include additional minimum pension liabilities of million and million at december  and  respectively  which were recorded as other comprehensive losses in stockholders equity 
the company s operating cash flows for included a million voluntary cash contribution to the us qualified pension plan 
although we are not required to make any cash contributions to this plan in  we are considering making voluntary cash contributions of approximately million 
we select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of high quality corporate bonds with particular focus on the moody s investors service  inc moody s aa rated corporate and industrial bond indices at the end of each respective year 
bonds in these indices have remaining maturities of at least years and the indices are constructed to have an average remaining maturity of approximately years 
we selected a discount rate of percent at december  for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
as described within sfas  the expected rate of return on plan assets is viewed as a long term  average rate of return to be earned on the assets invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
in developing the expected long term rate of return on asset assumption for our plan  we take into consideration the technical analysis using a geometric average performed by our outside actuaries  including historical market returns  information on long term real return expectations by asset class  inflation assumptions  and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates 
we also consider the historical performance of our own plan s trust  which has averaged percent over the last years in excess of comparable market indices for the same period as well as other factors 
the current asset allocation for our plan is approximately percent equities us and non us and percent fixed income investments 
given an actively managed investment portfolio  the expected returns by asset class for our portfolio  using a geometric average  and after being adjusted for an estimated inflation rate of approximately three percent  are between nine and eleven percent for both us and us equities  and between five and seven percent for fixed income investments  which generates a total expected portfolio return in excess of percent 
we continually monitor the appropriateness of this rate in light of current market conditions 
for the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in this assumption see our discussion below 
sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions 
a one half percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by million at december  and million at december   and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
a one half percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by million at december  and million at december   and increased pension and other postretirement benefit by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
a one half percent increase in the assumed expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
a one half percent decrease in the assumed long term rate of return on assets would have increased pension costs by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for this allowance  we have considered future taxable income and our ongoing tax planning strategies 
in the event that we determined that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
similarly  should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
at december  and  the valuation allowance was million and million  respectively 
results of operations  and overview our consolidated revenue for the years ended december   and was  million   million and  million  respectively 
in  our first full year as an independent pure play chemical company  we earned net income of million compared to a net loss of million in and net income of million in diluted earnings per common share for the year was compared to a diluted loss per common share of in and diluted earnings per common share of in net income for included restructuring and other charges and a discontinued operations loss totaling million after tax or per common share on a diluted basis 
in net income included restructuring and other charges  asset impairments and a discontinued operations loss totaling after tax or per common share on a diluted basis 
in net income included restructuring and other charges  asset impairments and a discontinued operations loss totaling million after tax or per common share on a diluted basis 
see results of operations and segment results for a detailed discussion of events affecting our results for  and all results discussed in this analysis address the continuing results of our chemical businesses 
the results of technologies  which was spun off on december   have been reclassified to discontinued operations within our consolidated statement of income for the years ended december  and and consolidated statement of cash flow for the years ended december  and see the reorganization of our company for an overview of our spin off of technologies 
results of operations compared to in the following discussion  year refers to the year ending december  and prior year refers to the year ending december  all comparisons are between these periods unless otherwise noted 
revenue for the year ended december  was  million compared to  million in  down percent 
lower revenue in compared to was principally attributable to lower revenue in our industrial chemicals and agricultural products segments 
our industrial chemicals segment saw generally lower selling prices and lower sales volumes due to unfavorable market conditions 
also affecting revenue were decreased agricultural products sales resulting from lower herbicide sales and unfavorable weather conditions in asia 
in  we expect increased revenue from our specialty chemicals and agricultural products segments as well as improved domestic markets served by industrial chemicals 
asset impairments 
there were no asset impairments in asset impairments totaled million million after tax in based upon a comprehensive review of our long lived assets  we recorded asset impairment charges in our industrial chemicals and specialty chemicals segments in industrial chemicals recorded impairment charges of million of which million related to the impairment of assets in our sodium cyanide operations while million was for the impairments in our us based phosphorus chemicals business 
a weakening market in our sodium cyanide business led us to impair the assets of this business in the second quarter of we subsequently exited this business in our us based phosphorus chemicals business is comprised of our percent interest in astaris and the activities of our corporate phosphorus division  which manages remediation and other environmental projects associated with the former astaris elemental phosphorus plant in pocatello  idaho 
based upon a comprehensive review of our long lived assets  we recorded asset impairment charges of million related to our us based phosphorus business in the second quarter of the components of asset impairments related to this business include a million impairment of environmental assets built to comply with a resource conservation and recovery act rcra consent decree the consent decree at the pocatello  idaho facility  a further million of other non environmental phosphorus related fixed assets and a million impairment charge for our investment in astaris 
driving these charges were a decline in market conditions  the loss of a potential site on which to develop an economically viable second purified phosphoric acid ppa plant and our agreement to pay into a fund for the shoshone bannock tribes the tribal fund resulting from an agreement to support a proposal to amend the consent decree  which permitted the earlier closure of the largest remaining waste disposal pond at pocatello 
in addition  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to our specialty chemicals segment s lithium operations in argentina 
we established this operation  which includes a lithium mine and processing facilities  approximately six years ago in a remote area of the andes mountains 
the entry of a south american manufacturer into this business resulted in decreased revenues 
in addition  market conditions continued to be unfavorable 
as a result  our lithium assets in argentina became impaired  as the total capital invested is not expected to be recovered 
restructuring and other charges totaled million million after tax in compared to million million after tax in in an effort to mitigate the effects of the continued economic weakness in the markets served by our industrial chemicals business we undertook several key reorganization and cost saving initiatives that resulted in million of restructuring charges in included in this amount was a million restructuring charge for the mothballing of the basic production line at our hydrogen peroxide facility in spring hill  west virginia 
of the severances incurred related to the spring hill mothballing  the majority will occur in the first half of we also mothballed our granger caustic facility  in green river  wyoming resulting in a million restructuring charge 
the majority of this charge was for facility shutdown activities and severances  all of which occurred in in addition we recorded a million restructuring charge for severance costs related to reorganization efforts to reduce costs in our us phosphorus chemicals division  alkali  peroxygens and at foret 
the majority of these charges were for severances  all of which occurred in we estimate that our industrial chemicals restructuring activities will result in approximately million of combined annual cost savings and cost avoidance 
in agricultural products we incurred million of restructuring charges in of which million related to the idling and reorganization of our sulfentrazone plant in baltimore in connection with our new herbicides strategy see segment results compared to 
a million restructuring charge was recorded for reorganization costs to implement a new distribution strategy in europe  which will allow us to rely on certain strategic alliances to further penetrate and expand our european markets 
of the severances related to these restructurings occurred in we estimate that the restructuring activities will result in approximately million of combined annual cost savings and cost avoidance 
we recorded million of restructuring charges in our specialty chemicals segment in in an effort to realign product divisions within biopolymer  both domestically and internationally 
the majority of these costs resulted in the severance of people 
these severances are expected to occur in the first half of we estimated that our specialty chemicals restructuring activities will result in approximately million of combined annual cost savings and cost avoidance 
reorganization costs of million and other charges of million were also recorded in the period 
these charges are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
also  of the million of restructuring charges recorded in million was spent in we expect the remainder to be spent in in a change in market conditions and the implementation of our overall corporate strategy resulted in restructuring and other charges of million  detailed as follows in millions gross recoveries net us phosphorus chemicals division consent decree obligation financing commitments to astaris tribal fund other phosphorus restructuring pocatello shutdown shutdown activities remediation fmc s share of astaris shutdown obligations total us phosphorus chemicals division workforce related facility shutdown fmc s reorganization total restructuring and other charges partial reversal of consent decree obligations 
commitment from astaris related to shutdown and remediation 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
industrial chemicals recorded restructuring and other charges of million in of which million was for restructuring at several sites  including million for the mothballing of our granger  wyoming soda ash facility  and million was for our us based phosphorus business 
there were severances from the restructuring of industrial chemicals  the majority of which occurred in  with the remainder occurring in in connection with the impairment of our us based phosphorus chemicals business in the second quarter of we recorded other charges for a million reserve for further required consent decree spending at the pocatello site related to environmental capital projects required to complete the construction of facilities to treat the sites waste streams  million for financing obligations to the astaris joint venture keepwell payments and a million payment to the tribal fund for various tribe activities in order to permit capping of a specific waste disposal pond at pocatello 
subsequent to the recording of these charges in the second quarter of  the astaris joint venture announced its plans  in october  to cease production at the pocatello  idaho elemental phosphorus facility in december this decision reflected the shift in astaris s sourcing strategy away from production of high cost elemental phosphorus to lower cost ppa  and also reflected the availability of low cost alternative feedstock materials  projected higher future environmental compliance costs at pocatello and our desire to avoid additional capital spending on environmental compliance assets required under the consent decree 
in connection with the decision to shut down pocatello we recorded restructuring charges of million in the fourth quarter of we spent million and million of these reserves in and  respectively  with the remaining reserves to be spent over the next to years as we manage the site s decommissioning and environmental issues 
these charges included reserves for decontamination  demolition  and other shut down costs of million  environmental remediation requirements resulting from the decision to shut down the facility of million and our percent share of costs recorded by astaris for its obligations associated with the shutdown  or million 
offsetting these charges was a reversal in the amount of million representing the unspent portion of the reserve recorded in the second quarter of for required consent decree spending at the pocatello site to build environmental compliance assets because the decision to shut down the site eliminated the need for further spending 
we also recorded as an offset to these charges a commitment from astaris to pay us million over the next years  reflecting the joint venture s obligation to contribute to our costs for the shutdown and remediation of the site 
we received million from astaris in related to this commitment and expect future payments to be funded from astaris s savings from the shutdown 
also included in the million of restructuring and other charges related to the us based phosphorus business was a charge of million for other restructuring activities which were not directly related to the shutdown of pocatello 
included in this charge were restructuring activities related to severance and decommissioning of a coke facility as well as charges related to the shutdown of two furnaces at pocatello 
the decision to shut down pocatello was consistent with astaris s plan to shift raw material supply for most products from high cost elemental phosphorus to lower cost ppa 
high energy  operating and environmental costs of producing elemental phosphorus have reinforced the relative cost advantage of ppa 
over time we expected to shift our supply chain to ppa at an annual cost savings of approximately million to astaris 
in addition  astaris was able to avoid estimated future costs of million per year associated with operating the environmental compliance assets related to the consent decree 
the decision to shut down pocatello in the fourth quarter of has allowed us to avoid spending of million for the remaining capital costs associated with completing the construction of environmental compliance assets and any start up costs for this plant  which could have been significant 
further  there also had been a concern that environmental compliance costs could escalate in future years and add further costs 
in addition  estimated future costs at astaris were expected to include a need to refurbish furnaces at pocatello in at an estimated cost of million 
in we recorded million of severance and other costs related to our agricultural products segment as a result of our strategic refocusing on key geographic markets and crops and the realignment of our r d resources to our core strength in insecticides 
the majority of the spending related to these charges occurred in these charges will result in future savings in both selling and administrative expenses and research and development costs 
the annualized savings from these restructurings were approximately million 
there were severances related to these charges  the majority of which occurred in of the remaining restructuring and other charges of million  approximately million related to corporate reorganization costs due to the spin off of technologies with remaining charges of million related to restructuring in specialty chemicals 
the majority of the spending associated with these charges occurred in and in the first half of the benefit of the restructuring and other charges from our corporate reorganization and spin off are not subject to reasonable estimation 
the benefits were directly related to improving stockholder value through creating a focused chemical company 
there were approximately severances related to these charges  the majority occurring in net interest expense in was million compared to million in the increase in interest expense can largely be attributed to higher average debt levels and higher interest rates from our refinancing 
see liquidity and capital resources and note to our consolidated financial statement included in this form k for further details on the refinancing and its effects on our results 
provision benefit for income taxes 
we recorded an income tax provision of million in compared to a benefit of million in resulting in effective tax rates of percent and percent  respectively 
the tax benefit is a direct result of the significant restructuring and other charges and impairments recorded in the differences between the effective tax rates for these periods and the statutory us federal income taxes rate relate primarily to differing foreign tax rates  depletion  the impairment of certain assets  foreign sales corporation benefits and incremental state taxes 
discontinued operations 
we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of million million after tax in for environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance 
see environmental obligations below and note to our consolidated financial statement included in this form k for further details 
we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of million million after tax in included in this amount are earnings of technologies  including interest expense of million  which was allocated to discontinued operations in accordance with accounting principles board statement no 
apb and later relevant accounting guidance  costs related to the spin off and an additional income tax provision related to the reorganization of our worldwide entities in anticipation of the separation of technologies from fmc 
in addition  we recorded a charge of million for updated estimates of environmental remediation costs related to our other discontinued businesses 
net income loss 
we recorded net income of million in compared to a net loss of million for this variance reflects million of asset impairments and million of restructuring and other charges recorded in net income in compared to  excluding asset impairments and restructuring and other charges  was lower due to lower sales in agricultural products and industrial chemicals  somewhat offset at the earnings level by lower costs through savings from our recent restructuring activities 
we expect net income to be lower in compared to mostly due to increased interest expense as a result of our recent refinancing and poorer performance from astaris in a difficult phosphorus market see liquidity and capital resources 
other financial data capital expenditures totaled million in compared to million in lower capital expenditures are the result of the lack of requirements for capital expansions and our continued focus on essential value creating projects 
also reducing capital expenditures was the lack of spending related to environmental assets at pocatello 
the need for continued spending on these environmental assets was eliminated in the fourth quarter of with the shutdown of pocatello 
the following are line items from our segment profit and loss statement used to reconcile segment operating profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
corporate expenses were million in and million in corporate expense represents shared costs that cannot be reasonably allocated among the segments 
other income and expense  net is comprised primarily of lifo inventory adjustments and pension income or expense 
net other loss for the year was million compared to a net other loss of million in this variance is largely attributable to a lifo reserve adjustment offset by additional pension and postretirement expenses 
segment results compared to segment operating profit is presented before taxes  asset impairments  restructuring and other charges  interest expense  net and other income and expense  net 
information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
agricultural products agricultural products revenue for the year ended december  was million  down percent  compared to million for the year ended december  herbicide sales decreased to million in compared to million in mainly due to a planned reduction in sulfentrazone sales  as we shift our focus from soybeans to higher value crops  and poor weather conditions in north america 
insecticide sales were down slightly at million in compared to million in mostly due to weaker insecticide demand in asia from drought conditions in australia and channel inventory reductions  somewhat offset by the development of new applications  so called new labels  and higher pest infestation levels on cotton in north america 
a stronger demand and new applications in our non agricultural markets such as turf ornamental and household pests also favorably affected sales in earnings for the year ended december  were million compared to million in the prior year 
lower herbicide sales and the absence of a million profit protection payment from ei du pont de nemours and company dupont were more than offset by lower selling  administrative and research costs 
see agricultural products under segment results compared to earnings also reflect agricultural products continuing strategic refocusing on key geographic markets and crops and to realign our r d resources to our core strengths in insecticides 
related to these refocusing efforts were restructuring charges in both and in we recorded million of restructuring charges for the idling and reorganization of our sulfentrazone plant in baltimore and to implement our new distribution strategy in europe 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million charge to eliminate all herbicide discovery research as well to reduce our direct sales and support staff to align resources to key geographic markets and crops 
restructuring charges are not included in the results of our business segments 
see restructuring and other charges under results of operations december  compare to december  for further details 
we believe our agricultural products segment will continue to show improvement in through new labels  sales growth from global alliances  continued cost savings and our refocus strategy 
specialty chemicals specialty chemicals revenue for the year ended december  was million  up percent from million in biopolymer revenue increased to million from million in reflecting a stronger pharmaceutical demand for microcrystalline cellulose  for its use in binders  and steady demand for carrageenan and microcrystalline cellulose in the food ingredients market 
partially offsetting increased revenue were lower alginate sales due to weaker industrial markets and an unfavorable carrageenan mix in food ingredients 
in lithium  revenue performance was million in compared to million in a stronger organolithium performance in the pharmaceutical and specialty polymer markets and increased demand for energy storage materials for both rechargeable and non rechargeable batteries were offset by lower exports of lithium salts to japan  due to a weaker economy  and the absence of a sale into the pharmaceutical markets which occurred the fourth quarter of earnings of million for the year ended december  were percent higher compared to million for higher earnings can be attributed to higher sales from overall biopolymer growth  a decrease in manufacturing costs in lithium  due largely to the devaluation of the argentine peso  and the absence of a million million after tax charge from the required change in accounting for amortization related to goodwill 
specialty chemicals goodwill was the direct result of biopolymer s acquisition of pronova biopolymer as 
lithium s earnings were also favorably impacted by higher butyllithium sales 
in addition  the large pharmaceutical sale in lithium  discussed above  delivered a high margin sale in that was not repeated in during  our biopolymer business experienced profit pressures within the industrial markets it serves principally with its alginate product line 
as a result  in we initiated a restructuring to reduce headcount and streamline production costs 
we believe that this action will further focus biopolymer s commercial efforts on core  high value markets  including pharmaceutical formulation  food ingredients and personal care 
we will focus our efforts on improving alginates profitability in by concentrating on higher value markets 
industrial chemicals industrial chemicals revenue was million for the year ended december   down percent  compared to million in alkali revenue decreased to million in from million in due to lower overall volumes  lower soda ash export prices and the first quarter sale of our sodium cyanide business 
a portion of the decline in soda ash revenues is attributable to the substitution by some of our industrial customers of caustic soda for soda ash  which occurs when caustic prices decline substantially as they did in the first quarter of furthermore  we experienced lower international sales volumes through the american natural soda ash association ansac  a foreign sales association for us soda ash 
foret saw a decrease in revenue to million in the current year compared to million in reflecting lower phosphate sales  due in part to the loss of a major european detergent customer and generally lower volumes and lower prices throughout its product lines 
somewhat offsetting decreased revenue at foret was the favorable translation effect of a stronger euro 
peroxygens hydrogen peroxide and active oxidants revenue decreased to million in from million in due to generally lower selling prices and lower persulfate volumes  reflecting a depressed printed circuit board market 
increased hydrogen peroxide volumes in non pulp markets along with stronger sales into the pulp markets in the second half of  somewhat offset lower average selling prices and lower persulfate volumes 
overall we have maintained earnings levels recording million of earnings in compared to in the prior year 
relatively flat earnings on lower sales reflected lower material costs  significant cost savings from our and restructuring efforts and lower operating costs related to reduced environmental compliance spending at pocatello 
reacting to market weakness in industrial chemicals in we recorded restructuring charges of million to improve our cost position through reorganization changes and mothballing significant parts of our granger caustic facility and spring hill  west virginia hydrogen peroxide facility 
during we recorded significant charges to impair and subsequently restructure our us based phosphorus chemicals business 
total charges for included an impairment charge of million and restructuring and other charges of million 
segment earnings do not include these charges 
asset impairments and restructuring and other charges are not included in our business segment results

the restructuring of our us based phosphorus chemicals business in late has allowed us to continue to improve our cost structure and competitive position as we move away from the production and sourcing of elemental phosphorus 
our us based phosphorus chemicals business s cost position should continue to improve as its ppa production increases 
the shutdown of pocatello also allowed fmc to eliminate capital spending on the environmental projects in and avoid significant start up and certain on going operating costs for environmental compliance issues at the site 
the restructuring activities in should improve our cost and competitive position in hydrogen peroxide from the mothballing at spring hill 
lower joint venture earnings at astaris and lower volumes and price throughout the segment offset the cost savings from our restructuring activities 
lower earnings from astaris were due to a percent decrease in sales to million in from million in the prior year 
a decreased benefit from the former power resale contract with idaho power and higher than expected startup costs at astaris s ppa plant were somewhat offset by lower sourcing costs 
the total resale power benefit to astaris in was approximately million compared to approximately million in this benefit will not continue in we generally foresee minimal improvement in economic and competitive conditions within industrial chemicals in because of a deterioration at astaris resulting from increased competitive rivalry at astaris and the lack of any benefit from the power resale we expect that equity losses from this joint venture will offset the anticipated improved profit performance of other products in our industrial chemicals segment in furthermore  we expect to make keepwell payments based on astaris s performance 
results of operations compared to revenue was  million in  down percent from  million in reflecting weaker demand from the industrial markets served by our industrial chemicals business segment and lower sulfentrazone sales in our agricultural products business segment 
asset impairments totaled million million after tax for compared to million million after tax in industrial chemicals recorded an impairment charge of million in a charge of million was for the impairment of assets in our sodium cyanide operations and million was for the impairment of our us based phosphorus business

we established this operation  which includes a lithium mine and processing facilities  approximately five years ago in a remote area of the andes mountains 
see asset impairments under results of operations compared to above for further details related to these charges 
during  we recorded asset impairments of million million after tax 
impairments of million were recognized because of the formation of astaris  including the write down of certain phosphorus assets retained by our company and the accrual of costs related to our planned closure of two phosphorus facilities 
other asset impairments were due to the impact of underlying changes within the specialty chemicals segment 
restructuring and other charges 
a change in market conditions and in our corporate strategy resulted in restructuring and other charges of million million after tax in a charge of million million after tax was recorded in industrial chemicals recorded restructuring and other charges of million in the majority of this charge  million  was for restructuring and other charges associated with our us based phosphorus operation 
the balance of this charge  million  was for restructuring activities at several sites including million for the mothballing of our granger soda ash facility 
also in we recorded million of severance and other costs related to our agricultural products segment  as a result of our decision to refocus certain r d activities 
the majority of the spending related to these charges occurred in of the remaining charges  million related to corporate reorganization costs due to the spin off of technologies and to several minor reorganization costs in our specialty chemicals segment 
the majority of the spending related to these charges occurred in and the first half of we reduced our workforce by approximately people in connection with our restructuring activities  the majority of which occurred within the same year 
during  we recorded restructuring and other charges of million million after tax 
restructuring charges of million were attributable to the formation of astaris and the concurrent reorganization of our industrial chemicals sales  marketing and support organizations  the reduction of office space requirements in our philadelphia chemical headquarters and pension expense related to the separation of phosphorus personnel from our company 
in addition  we recorded million of environmental charges from increased cost estimates for ongoing remediation of several phosphorus properties 
other restructuring charges included million for other projects 
of the approximately employee severances that were expected to occur through the completion of these programs in  occurred at december  while the remainder occurred in interest expense  net in was million compared to million in the decrease in net interest expense in was primarily the result of lower average debt levels during the year 
income loss from continuing operations was a loss of million in compared to income of million in most of the decline can be attributed to asset impairments and restructuring and other charges of million million after tax in compared to charges of million million after tax in also contributing to the decline were poor economic conditions affecting the chemical industry worldwide 
provision benefit for income taxes 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million in resulting in an effective tax rate of percent compared to income tax expense of million and an effective tax rate of percent in discontinued operations 
we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of million million after tax in included in this amount is a loss from technologies of million and a charge of million for updated estimates of environmental remediation costs related to our other discontinued businesses 
during  we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of million million after tax 
of this amount  million were from the earnings of the spun off technologies offset by an million loss for a settlement of litigation related to our discontinued defense systems business 
net income loss 
we recorded a net loss of million for compared to net income of million in this variance reflects the effect of significant asset impairments and restructuring and other charges recorded in other financial data capital expenditures were million in compared to million in decreased capital expenditures in reflected lower spending related to environmental assets at pocatello 
the need for these environmental assets was eliminated in the fourth quarter of with the shutdown of pocatello

corporate expenses were million in and million in corporate expense represents shared costs of the segments that cannot be reasonably allocated 
other income and expense  net is comprised primarily of lifo inventory adjustments and pension income or expense

agricultural products agricultural products revenue decreased to million in from million in agricultural products segment operating profit declined to million  down percent from herbicides revenue decreased percent to million in compared to million in reflecting the lack of sulfentrazone sales to dupont in herbicide sales were down reflecting these lower sulfentrazone sales  however  earnings in included a one time  profit protection payment from dupont of million see below 
excluding this payment  segment operating profit decreased percent in total sulfentrazone sales to dupont were million in insecticide revenue totaled million in compared to million in the insecticide revenue decrease was mostly due to weakness in asian and latin american markets 
in we entered into an exclusive agreement with dupont to provide them sulfentrazone in north america for use on soybeans 
however  the sale of formulated products incorporating sulfentrazone did not reach expectations and the contract purchases were cancelled in dupont no longer has exclusive rights to the use of sulfentrazone on soybeans in north america 
we began developing new markets in  expanding our sulfentrazone sales  including sales into the north america soybean market 
we believe that we have recovered approximately one third of the sulfentrazone volumes lost from the absence of dupont s purchases 
during the fourth quarter of  agricultural products began a restructuring of its operations to focus on key markets and products 
a restructuring charge of million million after tax was taken in to support these plans 
specialty chemicals specialty chemicals revenue was million in  down from million in due to lower revenue in both biopolymer and lithium 
specialty chemicals segment operating profit declined to million  or percent from million in the prior year 
biopolymer revenue decreased to million in compared to million in due to a combination of a weaker euro  weaker demand from customer inventory corrections and lower selling prices for alginates and carrageenan in specialty markets

the and revenue comparison was further affected by the inclusion of sales from our us based phosphorus chemicals business in the first three months of  which totaled million 
subsequent to march of  us phosphorus chemical sales have been deconsolidated and reflected through our equity investment in astaris 
lower operating profit reflected economic weakness during the year  increased power costs  consent decree spending at pocatello and the ppa plant startup costs 
during we continued to execute our business plan for our industrial chemicals business segment which included significant restructuring activities as well as our continued review of long term assets for impairment 
the goal was to mitigate the future effects of the anticipated economic slowdown as well as prepare the business for long term growth while maximizing cash generation

estimates of environmental spending are included in liquidity and capital resources 
liquidity and capital resources during  we strengthened our liquidity position and obtained adequate capital resources for planned business operations by completing a series of financing transactions 
on june   we issued million shares of common stock and used the net proceeds of million to reduce amounts borrowed under our million senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
this was the first step in a refinancing plan in which we intended subsequently to issue unsecured bonds and renew and extend the maturity of our million revolving credit facility 
in june  subsequent to the completion of our common stock offering  moody s lowered its rating of our long term debt from baa to ba moody s rating of baa is the tenth level from the top of its ratings scale comprised of twenty long term debt ratings 
its downgrade of our long term debt rating by one level to ba  or the eleventh of twenty ratings  was from its lowest investment grade rating to the highest level of the non investment grade category 
moody s also lowered its rating of our short term debt from p to np  the fourth level from the top of its five level short term debt ratings scale 
subsequent to these actions by moody s  we ceased offerings under our commercial paper program and repaid maturities through borrowings under our million senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
also resulting from the downgrade in our credit ratings  availability decreased under our former accounts receivable securitization program  which was offset by increased borrowings under our million senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
the ratings downgrades resulted in several changes to our refinancing plan 
on october   we completed a refinancing in which we issued million aggregate principal amount of percent senior secured notes due the notes at a discount of million 
simultaneously  we entered into a new million senior secured credit agreement the credit agreement  which provides for a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan facility  and obtained a million supplemental secured standby letter of credit facility the supplemental letter of credit facility and together with the credit agreement  the credit facilities 
on october  we obtained million  net of discounts  from the credit agreement s term loan facility 
the net proceeds from the sale of the notes and borrowings under the credit agreement totaling million were used to fund million into a debt reserve account the debt reserve account  included in restricted cash  to redeem million in aggregate principal amount of our percent medium term notes due november and million aggregate principal amount of our percent debentures due in september repay all borrowings under and terminate our former revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility  which had outstanding amounts of million and million  respectively  both of which were terminated on october   fund into a restricted cash account the restricted cash collateral account  included in restricted cash  million to refinance and replace with cash collateral certain surety bonds and letters of credit supporting self insurance programs  environmental obligations and future business commitments and provide million of cash to collateralize letters of credit supporting variable rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds  and pay fees and expenses of approximately million  which included bank fees  and various other costs 
the supplemental letter of credit facility was utilized in connection with our refinancing to provide letters of credit totaling million in support of self insurance programs and environmental obligations 
among other restrictions  the credit facilities contain financial covenants related to leverage measured as the ratio of adjusted earnings to debt  interest coverage measured as the ratio of interest expense to adjusted earnings  consolidated net worth and capital spending 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants at december  see note of our consolidated financial statements included in this form k for a summary of the terms for both the notes and the new credit facilities 
prior to the completion of our refinancing  we obtained funding through an accounts receivable securitization program 
we sold receivables  without recourse  through our wholly owned bankruptcy remote subsidiary  fmc funding corporation  which then sold the receivables to an unrelated finance company 
the sold receivables and repurchase obligations related to the securitization program were not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
the accounting for our former accounts receivable securitization program was in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
the transfer of accounts receivable qualified as a sale under the provisions of sfas no 
as a result of our surrender of control of these financial assets  without recourse  in exchange for cash 
accordingly  we recorded a reduction of accounts receivable equal to the total amount of cash received from fmc funding corporation in connection with the transaction 
the downgrade of our long term debt rating by moody s in june reduced the funds available to us from this program 
funds from the accounts receivable securitization totaled million at december  on october  we terminated our accounts receivable securitization program with proceeds from our new financing 
we maintained a million committed revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in december the total amount outstanding under this facility at december  was million

at december   we had total debt of  million compared to debt of million as of december  this included million of short term debt at december   comprised almost entirely of foreign borrowings  compared to million at december  there were no revolving credit borrowings outstanding under our new credit agreement at december  during significant events affecting our liquidity included spending against restructuring and other reserves of million  including paying million for the shutdown and remediation our pocatello plant  paying million for scheduled maturities and for redemptions of long term debt  paying million to redeem all of the outstanding percent exchangeable senior subordinated debentures  redeeming million of our percent debentures due september and issuing million shares of common stock with net proceeds of million 
cash and cash equivalents at december  and december  were million and million  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to cash required by operating activities of million in and cash provided by operating activities of million in historically  cash flows from operating activities have funded a substantial portion of our cash requirements 
in and cash from operating activities was reduced by the net cash impact of spending related to our restructuring and other charges 
included in our operating cash activities in is million for spending on restructuring and other activities  including million for the shutdown and remediation of pocatello 
the future spending against restructuring reserves related to the pocatello shutdown of million at december is expected to continue through with progressively less spent in each of the future years 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased significantly in reflecting lower business activity  including lower inventory  in than in also favorably affecting our cash provided by operating activities was improved collections of accounts receivable especially within agricultural products  particularly in latin america 
cash required by discontinued operations for the twelve months ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the majority of the spending for our discontinued operations is for environmental remediation on discontinued sites and post employment benefits for former employees of discontinued businesses

cash required by investing activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the majority of this spending related to capital additions to our property  plant and equipment to maintain operating standards and comply with environmental  health and safety regulations 
also included in investing activities are keepwells to astaris of million and million for and  respectively 
a planned reduction in capital spending in compared to contributed to the decline in cash required by investing activities 
additionally  included approximately million for spending on environmental remediation assets at pocatello 
the fourth quarter decision to shut down pocatello enabled us to curtail this spending 
cash required by investing activities in was reduced by a net cash distribution by astaris to fmc of million 
cash provided by financing activities for of million decreased by million when compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in our financing activities included a net increase in long term debt of million from net proceeds of our refinancing of million 
the current year s activity also reflects million paid to redeem long term debt  a million decrease in our vendor financing and million paid to terminate our accounts receivable securitization program in october this program had an outstanding balance of million at december  our long term debt repayments included payments of million  million and million  respectively  in the first  second and fourth quarters of for scheduled maturities  the redemption of million aggregate principal amount of our percent debentures due september and several other minor maturities

commitments and other potential liquidity needs our cash needs include operating cash requirements  capital expenditures  scheduled maturities of long term debt  equity contributions to astaris  an expected contingent payment due at year end related to the acquisition of tg soda ash  environmental spending and restructuring spending 
we plan to meet these liquidity needs through cash generated from operations and borrowings under the new credit agreement 
we have provided an agreement to lenders of astaris under which we have agreed to make equity contributions to astaris sufficient to make up one half of shortfalls in astaris s earnings below certain levels 
astaris s earnings did not meet the agreed levels for and and we do not expect that such earnings will meet the levels agreed for we contributed million to astaris under this arrangement in and million in we expect our equity contributions to astaris in to be between million and million 
the proportional amount of astaris s indebtedness subject to this agreement from fmc was approximately million at december  in  certain amendments to the agreement under which fmc makes equity contributions to astaris that were necessary to complete our refinancing were obtained from astaris s lenders 
on june   we acquired tg soda ash  inc from elf atochem north america  inc for approximately million in cash and a contingent payment due at year end the contingent payment amount  which will be based on the financial performance of the combined soda ash operations between and  cannot currently be determined precisely but is expected to be in the range of million to million 
projected spending also includes approximately million of environmental remediation spending  of which million relates to pocatello and million for other operating and discontinued business sites 
this spending does not include expected spending of approximately million and million in and  respectively  on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities 
also  we expect to spend in the range of approximately million to million annually in and in for environmental compliance costs  which are an operating cost of the company and are not covered by established reserves 
other commitments that could affect our liquidity include the following in connection with the spin off of technologies  we retained liability for various contingent obligations totaling million at december  contractual releases obtained by fmc have reduced this amount to million at december  we expect this amount to decline further in contingent obligations include guarantees of the performance of technologies under various customer contracts  reimbursements on behalf of technologies under letters of credit  and guarantees of indebtedness of technologies 
we have a guaranty agreement from technologies providing for reimbursement to us if we are ever called upon to satisfy these obligations 
because of our expectation that the underlying obligations will be met and the existence of the guarantee from technologies  we believe it is unlikely that we would have to pay any of these contingent obligations 
in the ordinary course of business  we provide credit enhancements to governmental agencies  insurance companies  and others for our environmental obligations  self insurance programs and other future business commitments 
as part of our refinancing  we funded million into a restricted cash collateral account  to provide for future cash collateralization of a portion of these obligations 
additionally  we obtained million of standby letters of credit under our supplemental letter of credit facility

subsequent to december   as part of our refinancing  we obtained sufficient cash to collateralize  fully  these letters of credit 
we provide parent guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries 
the outstanding amounts of debt guaranteed were million and million  respectively  at december  and we provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain agricultural products customers in brazil for their seasonal borrowing needs 
the customers obligations to us are largely secured by liens on their crops 
the total of these guarantees at december  was million compared to million at december  we also provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain agricultural products customers in brazil to support their importation of third party agricultural products 
these guarantees totaled million and million december  and at december   respectively 
our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next five years and beyond are as follows expected cash payments by year contractual commitments beyond total in millions short term debt long term debt maturities lease obligations forward energy and foreign exchange contracts tg soda ash contingent payment astaris keepwell payments total before discounts 
before recoveries 
based on the low end of our estimated range 
astaris keepwell payments are based on the low end of our estimated range of possible keepwell payments 
dividends on november   our board of directors approved the spin off of the remaining percent of technologies making it an independent publicly traded company 
the spin off qualified as a tax free distribution to us stockholders 
stockholders of record as of december  received approximately shares of common stock of the new company for every share of our stock 
fractional shares were paid in cash to stockholders in lieu of fractional shares on december  no cash dividends were paid in no cash dividends were paid in other than amounts paid in lieu of fractional shares as discussed above

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings  cash flows  and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
it is our policy to minimize cash flow exposure to changes in currency and exchange rates through a controlled program of risk management by entering into derivative contracts with major financial institutions 
the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices 
the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen 
the market value foreign currency risk is calculated by us  using a third party software model which uses standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions spot and forward exchange rates as of the valuation date 
the market value energy price risk is calculated by a third party 
at december  and december   our net financial instrument position was a net liability of million and million  respectively 
the change in the net financial instrument position was due to improved positions in our natural gas forward contracts due to increased energy prices somewhat offset by favorable foreign currency forward contracts against a strengthening euro 
interest rate risk our debt portfolio at december  is composed of percent fixed rate debt and percent variable rate debt 
the largest portion of our variable rate debt is from our million term loan facility which was outstanding for approximately two months in the majority of our debt portfolio at december  was composed of fixed rate debt 
changes in interest rates have different impacts on the variable rate portions of our debt portfolio 
a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows  but does not impact the net financial instrument position 
based on the variable rate debt included in our debt portfolio as of december  and  a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not significantly affect net income in either year 
commodity price risk energy costs are approximately percent of our cost of sales and services 
we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of natural gas 
below is a sensitivity analysis reflecting the effect of changing energy prices 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous percent change in natural gas prices from their levels at december  and december with all other variables including interest rates held constant 
a percent increase in new york mercantile exchange nymx prices would result in a decrease of million in the net liability position of the relevant financial instruments into a net asset position at december  and decrease of million in the net liability position of the relevant financial instruments at december  a percent decrease in nymx prices would result in increases of million and million in the net liability position of the relevant financial instruments at december  and december   respectively 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro  the euro versus the norwegian krone  the us dollar versus the japanese yen and the us dollar versus the brazilian real 
foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business  thereby reducing our net asset exposure 
foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
below is a sensitivity analysis reflecting the effect of changing foreign currency rates 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december  and december   with all other variables including interest rates held constant 
a percent strengthening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would result in a increase of million in the net liability position and a decrease of million in the net asset position into a net liability of the relevant financial instruments at december  and december   respectively 
a percent weakening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would result in a decrease of million in the net liability position into a net asset position of the relevant financial instruments at december  and an increase of million in the net asset position of the relevant financial instruments at december  and december
