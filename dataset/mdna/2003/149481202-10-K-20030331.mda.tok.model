results of operations overview was another year of progress and growth in the us market for catuity s loyalty software products 
in addition  the us market for smart cards continued to emerge as the issuance of cards and the investment necessary for their adoption continued to accelerate over prior years levels 
in  visa expanded its efforts and mastercard announced its one smart initiative that will further the expansion of smart card use in the us one smart is designed to provide card issuers with a flexible  customizable approach to packaging applications to differentiate their smart card from all others  and to provide retailers and cardholders unique benefits from using the card 
during the fourth quarter of catuity underwent the extensive due diligence process required by mastercard and recently became a participant in the mastercard one smart program 
in the summer of visa began using our loyalty software in test markets  and in the latter part of the year  target began a roll out of their new pos equipment and use of our loyalty software in selected stores 
the company also completed the installation of its software at two new customers that will expand its use in and beyond 
during catuity received a notice of allowance from the us patent and trademark office on two of our patent applications 
the first of the two patents was issued in september we received the notice of allowance for the second patent in december and it was formally issued in march the company was also granted a patent in australia in and has patents pending in the us  canada  europe  australia  japan  brazil  and new zealand 
the most recent patent granted in the us is particularly valuable because of its scope involving our unique methods of data storage on smart cards 
we believe our patents help us meet our strategy of protecting our intellectual property  protecting our customers interests  and staying on the cutting edge of technology in our markets 
in march catuity resolved the welcome real time wrt legal matter 
the settlement brought the australian lawsuit that had been active in and early to closure 
as part of the settlement  wrt and catuity agreed to end all legal actions in australia with no material future financial consequences for either party and to prohibit the initiation of any future lawsuits over patents on a global basis by agreeing to compulsory mediation and binding arbitration in the event of any future patent disputes 
in november  catuity completed the private placement of  shares to two accredited institutional investors and  shares to boom australia pty 
ltd  the family trust of mr 
duncan pf mount  a non executive director of catuity 
boom australia s participation is subject to shareholder approval and is being sought at a special meeting of shareholders to be held on march  in sydney  australia 
the placement resulted in net proceeds of  excluding mr 
mount s  that will be used for general operating purposes  including furthering catuity s investigation into the data analytics and predictive modeling aspects of customer relationship management 
in addition to the private placement  during  a san francisco based fund acquired approximately  shares in catuity through open market purchases 
as a result of these efforts  catuity was able to strengthen its capital structure  and increase the holdings of institutional investors in the company 
during catuity established an executive stock purchase plan espp and an executive director stock purchase plan edspp as a way of increasing our executives holdings in the company and aligning their interests with those of our shareholders 
the edspp is subject to shareholder approval  which is also being sought in the march special meeting of shareholders 
the plans do not provide the executives any discount to our share price in the open market 
rather  they allow the executives to increase their holdings via a routine month end purchase of shares from the cash compensation that each executive deferred during that month 
all of the executives eligible to participate have thus far chosen to use of their cash compensation to purchase shares in the company each month 
there are a number of factors that impacted the smart card market in the us in the positive factors include the strong commitment by visa usa to the introduction of smart cards 
the integration of payment and loyalty  which began in and increased in  is expected to continue in catuity has been actively involved in developing interoperability standards to integrate loyalty transactions with payment transactions 
the pace with which card issuing banks issued smart cards and merchants began installing pos devices that are smart card compatible accelerated in the negative factors that affected the market included the sluggishness of the us economy in  the relative slowness of pos device suppliers to deliver multi application devices and the slowness of merchants to adopt pos devices that are smart card compatible 
these factors have resulted in a delay in the long anticipated  growth of smart cards in the us although the smart card market in general  and the smart visa rewards program are very important to us  we also continued to pursue contracts with customers using our software with magnetic stripe cards 
we expect that will be the first year that the company earns a significant percentage of its total revenue from license fees 
the speed with which our customers progress with their plans and the success they achieve in their product launches could have an impact on these estimates

when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application is generally accepted  we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing circumstances 
as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due regard to materiality 
accounts receivable the company records an allowance against gross accounts receivable to provide for doubtful accounts 
the allowance is estimated based on the age of the receivable  specific circumstances surrounding the collection of an invoice  and historical data on allowances as a percentage of aged accounts receivable balances 
actual collection on accounts may differ from the allowance the company has estimated 
revenue recognition the three distinct revenue streams that result from the company s business activities are license revenue  software development revenue  and service revenue 
license revenue is recognized in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  which provides for recognition of revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant obligations remain on the company s part with regard to implementation  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
sop generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element 
revenue recognized from multiple element arrangements is allocated to undelivered elements of the arrangement  such as maintenance  based on the relative fair value of each element 
the company s determination of fair value of each element in multi element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
the company limits its assessment of vsoe for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management for an element not yet sold separately 
the company has vsoe for maintenance services 
the company generally does not provide for a right of return in its license contracts 
software development revenue includes integration  customization and development fees of both the customer s hardware and software and the company s software 
software development revenue is billed on a fixed price basis 
the company recognizes revenue on fixed price contracts on the percentage of completion basis in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition  and sop  accounting for performance of construction type contracts  based on hours incurred as a percentage of estimated total hours of the respective contract 
the cumulative impact of any revisions in estimated total revenues and direct contract costs are recognized in the period in which they become known 
revenue in excess of billings is recognized as unbilled receivables and is included in work in process in the consolidated balance sheet 
billings in excess of revenue are recorded as deferred revenue until revenue recognition criteria are met 
had the company adopted the completed contract method for revenue recognition on software development based projects  the revenue recorded per period could materially differ from amounts recorded under the percentage of completion method 
service revenue includes training  consulting  installation support  post installation support and maintenance fees 
training  consulting  installation support and post installation support are generally billed on a time and material basis and revenue is recognized as the service is provided 
maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the maintenance term 
the company does not generally provide for right of return in its customer contracts 
deferred tax assets the company records a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
based on historical operating losses  it is difficult to determine the amount or timing of future earnings  therefore  there is currently no tax benefit recorded by the company 
accounting for equity instruments the company accounts for stock based awards issued to employees under the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
for all fixed stock based awards issued to employees  we record an expense based on the intrinsic value  if any  of the awards and amortize the expense over the vesting period 
had the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  the expense recorded per period could materially differ from amounts recorded under the intrinsic value method 
for variable awards issued to employees and awards issued to third parties  we record an expense based on the fair value of the award at each balance sheet date using the black scholes valuation model and amortize the expense over the vesting period 
for issuances of stock to third parties for services  we record an expense at the date of issuance based on the number of shares issued multiplied by the closing stock price of the date of issuance 
for stock issued to customers  we record a sales discount in a similar manner 
for the non recourse loans previously issued to a director to purchase stock  we record an expense based on the number of loan shares outstanding multiplied by the closing stock price on the date of the loan 
at each balance sheet date  we adjust the cumulative expense recorded to equal the number of non recourse loan shares outstanding multiplied by the closing stock price at each balance sheet date 
any increase or decrease in the cumulative expense is recorded in the statement of operations 
legal proceedings details of legal proceedings are included in item above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our expenses  assets and liabilities denominated in the australian dollar 
to date  we have not utilized any foreign currency hedging or other derivative instruments to reduce exchange rate risk 
we do not expect to employ these or other strategies to hedge the risk in the foreseeable future 
as of december   and the company s net current assets defined as current assets less current liabilities subject to foreign currency risk are  and  the potential decrease in net assets from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately  and  net current assets subject to foreign currency risk are larger as of december  compared to due to larger cash balances maintained in australia 
we are also exposed to interest rate risk on deposits of cash  which are affected by changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states and australia 
since we generally invest in very short term interest bearing deposits  we do not believe we are subject to any material market risk exposure
