the mechanical equipment group operations in continued to decline due to the economic downturn  especially in the telecommunications area 
this was the second year of reporting a reduction of sales in spite of a strong sales effort and management s work to introduce new products acceptance 
the industry remains highly competitive 
management continues to be committed to retain market share and continue its positive direction in spite of the existing current economic climate 
the toy segment operations in were little changed from the prior year 
the industry s attempts to introduce major new products into the marketplace have not materialized 
the us dollar weakness during the year along with the west coast dock strike and continuing increases in labor and other marketing costs  provided added pressure to maintain profit margins 
the small improvement in the toy segment operations is not reflective of any industry trend  but the continuation of customers balancing their inventory levels 
management remains committed to search for  review and test new items that fall within its pricing structure in its quest to improve sales and margin in this highly competitive environment

the mechanical equipment group operations in reflected the downturn of the economy 
competition remained intense for the reduced amount of available sales 
management s goals have remained consistent during the year in attempting to maintain a highly competitive market share and new product acceptance in spite of the adverse economic conditions 
the toy segment remained in a lackluster market 
industry attempts to introduce what are perceived to be hot new items had on an overall basis been unsuccessful 
new meaningful licenses had not surfaced 
the same challenges indicated in the past affect the industry namely product  labor and marketing costs 
the strength of the us dollar in purchasing product overseas  had little effect in reducing costs 
while the toy segment operations this past year showed a small improvement  management believed the results were not of a trend but of customers balancing their inventory levels 
management continued to seek  review and test new items that fall within its pricing structure in a highly competitive marketing area

critical accounting policies we have prepared our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
this has required us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affected the amounts we reported 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements contains the significant accounting principles that we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified a few critical accounting policies that required us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time of our estimates 
had we used different estimates and assumptions  the amounts we recorded could have been significantly different 
additionally  actual results that would have a material effect on our accounting policies that were affected by the estimates  assumptions  and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements are listed below 
inventories 
certain of our inventories are valued at the lower of cost  on the last in  first out lifo method  or market 
the remainder of our inventories are valued at the lower of cost  on the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
we periodically assess this inventory for obsolescence and potential excess by reducing the difference between our cost and the estimated market value of the inventory based on assumptions about future demand historical sales patterns 
if market conditions or future demand are less favorable than our current expectations  additional inventory write downs or reserves may be required  which could have an adverse effect on our reported results in the period the adjustments are made 
income taxes 
we comply with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we have determined that it is more likely than not that our future taxable income will be sufficient to realize our deferred tax assets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risks our cash and cash equivalent investments are exclusively in short term money market investments and us treasury money market investments with maturities generally less than days 
they are subject to limited interest rate risks 
a change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial statements
