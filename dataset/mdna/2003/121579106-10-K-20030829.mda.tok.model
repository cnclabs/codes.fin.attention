item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company maintains its records on the basis of a week fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to may the following discussion compares the twelve months weeks ended may  with the twelve months weeks ended june  and the twelve months weeks ended june  with the twelve months weeks ended june  critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue returns  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  financing operations  asset impairment  retirement benefits  risk participation agreements  vendor promotional allowances  reserves for closed store and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that the following represent its more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  although the list is not exhaustive page of the company s inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail first in  first out fifo inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventory at cost and resulting gross margin are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventory 
the retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
additionally  it is recognized that the use of the retail inventory method will result in valuing inventory at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventory 
inherent in the retail inventory method calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  merchandise markon  markups  markdowns and shrinkage which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margin 
management bel ieves that the company s retail inventory method and application of fifo provides an inventory valuation which approximates cost using a first in  first out assumption and results in carrying value at the lower of cost or market 
estimates are used to charge inventory shrinkage for the first three fiscal quarters of the fiscal year 
an actual physical inventory is conducted at the end of the fiscal year to calculate actual shrinkage 
the company also estimates its required markdown allowances 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional markdowns may be required 
while the company makes estimates on the basis of the best information available to it at the time estimates are made  over accruals or under accruals may be uncovered as a result of the physical inventory requiring fourth quarter adjustments 
the company has risk participation agreements with insurance carriers with respect to workers compensation and liability insurance 
pursuant to these arrangements  the company is responsible for paying claims up to designated dollar limits 
the amounts included in the company s costs related to these claims are estimated and can vary based on changes in assumptions or claims experience included in the associated insurance programs 
the company records reserves for future revenue returns 
the reserves are based on current revenue volume and historical claim experience 
if claims experience differs from historical levels  revisions in the company s estimates may be required 
page of the company tests for recoverability of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
this includes performing an analysis of anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of long lived assets 
if the carrying value of the related assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flow  the company reduces the carrying value to its fair value  which is generally calculated using discounted cash flows 
various factors including future sales growth and profit margins are included in this analysis 
to the extent these future projections change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the estimates 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying assets could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the assets that may not be reflected in an asset s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required
