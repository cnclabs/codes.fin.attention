item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates cohu s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon cohu s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires cohu to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  cohu evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation 
cohu bases its estimates on historical experience and current developments and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
cohu believes the following critical accounting policies  that are more fully described in the cohu consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein  affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition cohu generally recognizes revenue upon shipment and title passage for established products ie  those that have previously satisfied customer acceptance requirements that provide for full payment tied to shipment 
revenue for products that have not previously satisfied customer acceptance requirements or from sales where customer payment dates are not determinable is recognized upon customer acceptance 
accounts receivable cohu maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of cohu s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty cohu provides for the estimated costs of product warranties in the period sales are recognized 
cohu s warranty obligation is affected by historical product shipment levels  product performance and material and labor costs incurred in correcting product performance problems 
should product performance  material usage or labor repair costs differ from cohu s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
inventory cohu records valuation reserves on its inventory for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future product demand and market conditions 
if future product demand or market conditions are less or more favorable than those projected by management  changes to inventory reserves may be required 
income taxes cohu estimates income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet 
the net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based upon all available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
establishing a valuation allowance or increasing this allowance in an accounting period results in tax expense in the statement of operations 
cohu must make significant judgments to determine the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against net deferred tax assets 
our net deferred tax asset balance as of december   was million  net of a valuation allowance of million 
we recorded the valuation 
table of contents allowance in the fourth quarter of as a result of our recent losses and to reflect uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate future taxable income and our corresponding ability to utilize our deferred tax assets 
the deferred tax assets consist primarily of deductible temporary differences  tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards 
intangible assets at december   intangible assets other than goodwill were evaluated for impairment using undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets as required by fasb statement no 
we concluded that there was an impairment loss at december  related to certain intangible assets 
cohu was required to assess goodwill impairment in using the methodology prescribed by fasb statement no 
statement no 
requires that a transitional goodwill impairment test be performed as of january  and completed by june  cohu did not recognize any goodwill impairment as a result of performing this transitional test 
statement no 
also requires that goodwill be tested for impairment on an annual basis and more frequently in certain circumstances 
the required annual goodwill impairment test was performed as of october  cohu did not recognize any goodwill impairment as a result of performing this annual test 
recent accounting pronouncement in june   the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
statement no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
the adoption of statement no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the company does not expect the adoption of statement no 
to have a significant impact on the company s future results of operations or financial position 
results of operations cohu s primary business activity involves the development  manufacture  marketing and servicing of test handling equipment for the global semiconductor industry 
demand for cohu s products can change significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  changes in global economic conditions  supply and demand for semiconductors  changes in semiconductor manufacturing capacity and processes and competitive product offerings 
due to these and other factors  cohu s results of operations for the period to  may not be indicative of future operating results 
certain matters discussed below  including expectations of market conditions  challenges and plans  are forward looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted herein 
such risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
compared to cohu continued to be impacted by the downturn in the semiconductor equipment industry that began in late despite the downturn  our net sales increased to million in  compared to net sales of million in sales of semiconductor test handling equipment in  increased from the period and accounted for of consolidated net sales in  versus in sales of television cameras and other equipment accounted for of net sales in and decreased when compared to  while the combined sales of metal detection and microwave equipment increased 
cohu recognized a pretax gain in the third quarter of  of approximately million from the sale of its san diego facilities 
the third quarter of  was also impacted by a pretax charge of approximately million for acquired in process research and development as a result of cohu s july   purchase of the assets of automated systems 
in the fourth quarter of  cohu entered into a million license agreement for certain intellectual property and know how from livetools technology sa 
in december   cohu invested million in kryotech  inc preferred stock 
cohu is committed to invest an additional million in kryotech upon the successful completion of a joint development program between the companies 
cohu is accounting for its less than ownership interest in kryotech under the cost method 
a decrease in the value of this investment may result in a charge to cohu s future operating results 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in  primarily as a result of higher margins in the semiconductor equipment business 
within the semiconductor equipment segment  margins increased in  primarily as a result of decreased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
cohu computes the majority of its excess and obsolete inventory reserve requirements using a one year inventory usage forecast 
during and  we recorded net charges to cost of sales of approximately million million of charges for excess and obsolete less credits and million  respectively  primarily as a result of declines in customer forecasts that negatively impacted our forecasted inventory usage 
while we believe our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory are adequate to cover our exposures at december   reductions in customer forecasts may require additional charges to operations that could negatively impact our gross margin in future periods 
conversely  if our actual inventory usage is greater than our forecasted usage  reductions to our inventory reserve requirements may favorably impact our gross margin in future periods 

table of contents research and development expense r d as a percentage of net sales was in  compared to in  increasing in absolute dollars from million in  to million in the increase in r d was primarily the result of higher r d labor costs as a result of the automated systems acquisition completed in july   increased spending on product development in the semiconductor equipment business and the write off and amortization of certain intangible assets of million

at december   cohu assessed the need for a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets 
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income  in appropriate tax jurisdictions  in future years  to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and net operating tax loss and credit carryforwards 
in the fourth quarter of  the company established a valuation allowance of approximately million against deferred tax assets due to the uncertainties surrounding their realization 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods should cohu determine that estimates of future taxable income are reduced or increased 
cohu tested the million of goodwill resulting from the automated systems acquisition for impairment during  as required by fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
during  the company completed the required transitional and annual goodwill impairment tests 
the company did not record an impairment loss as a result of these impairment tests as the estimated fair value of the related reporting unit was in excess of the carrying amount of its assets  including goodwill 
a decline in the fair value of the reporting unit may indicate impairment that could result in a charge to cohu s future operating results 
cohu evaluated the intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment at december   as required by fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
the company compared the undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from the use of the intangible assets  including related goodwill  to their carrying value 
as a result of this analysis  the company determined that the intangible assets  other than goodwill  that resulted from the automated systems acquisition were impaired and an impairment loss of million representing the excess of the assets carrying value over their fair value was recorded in the fourth quarter of the impairment loss and amortization previously recorded is included in research and development expense 
as a result of the factors set forth above  our net loss was million in  compared to a net loss of million in compared to cohu was impacted by the severe downturn in the semiconductor equipment industry that began in late  and continued throughout all of  and as a result our net sales decreased to million in  compared to net sales of million in sales of semiconductor test handling equipment in  decreased from the  period and accounted for of consolidated net sales in  versus in sales of television cameras and other equipment accounted for of net sales in  versus in  and decreased while the combined sales of metal detection and microwave communications equipment decreased 
cohu recognized a pretax gain in the third quarter of  of approximately million from the sale of our san diego facilities 
we received a cash payment of million and a note receivable for million from the buyer 
the non recourse note bears interest at and is secured by a deed of trust on the property 
the third quarter of  was also impacted by a pretax charge of approximately million for acquired in process research and development as a result of our july   purchase of the assets of automated systems 
the million cash purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired in accordance with fasb statement no 
in accordance with statement no 
 goodwill amounting to million is not subject to amortization 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to in  from in  primarily as a result of lower margins in the semiconductor equipment business 
within the semiconductor equipment segment  margins decreased in  primarily as a result of decreased business volume and increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
during  we recorded charges totaling approximately million for excess and obsolete inventory primarily as a result of declines in customer forecasts that negatively impacted our forecasted inventory usage

net cash used for financing activities was million 
cash provided by financing activities included million received from the issuance of stock from stock option and purchase plans offset by million for the payment of dividends 
the company had million available under its bank line of credit and working capital of million at december  it is anticipated that present working capital and available borrowings under the line of credit will be sufficient to meet the company s operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
future minimum payments on operating leases as of december   are  totaling  in january   cohu announced that its delta design subsidiary was relocating its columbus  ohio operations to its headquarters facility in poway  california 
the consolidation is expected to reduce costs without impacting the revenue generating activities of delta design 
the company expects the consolidation to be completed in the second quarter of  and to record a charge to operations of approximately million in  for severance and other related costs 
trends  risks and uncertainties the semiconductor industry we serve is highly volatile and unpredictable 
cohu s operating results are substantially dependent on our semiconductor equipment business 
this capital equipment business is in turn highly dependent on the overall strength of the semiconductor industry 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply and excess capacity  which often have had a significant effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for capital equipment  including equipment of the type manufactured and marketed by cohu 
we anticipate that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment may also be subject to similar cycles and severe downturns  such as those experienced in  and late  continuing throughout and reductions in capital equipment investment by semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor test subcontractors will materially and adversely affect our business  financial position and results of operations 
in addition  the volatile and unpredictable nature of semiconductor equipment demand has in the past and may in the future expose us to significant excess and obsolete inventory write offs and reserve requirements 
in the years ended december  and december   we recorded pretax net inventory related charges of approximately million and million  respectively  primarily as a result of changes in customer forecasts 
a limited number of customers account for a substantial percentage of our net sales 
we rely on a limited number of customers for a substantial percentage of our net sales 
in  two customers of the semiconductor equipment segment accounted for in  and in of our net sales 
during the past five years  the percentage of cohu s sales derived from each of these and other significant customers has varied greatly 
such variations are due to changes in the customer s business and their purchase of products from our competitors 
it is common in the ic test handler industry for customers to purchase equipment from more than one equipment supplier  increasing the risk that our competitive position with a specific customer may deteriorate 
no assurance can be given that we will continue to maintain our competitive position with these or other significant customers 
furthermore  we expect the percentage of our revenues derived from significant customers will vary greatly in future periods 
the loss of  or a 
table of contents significant reduction in  orders by these or other significant customers as a result of competitive products  market conditions  outsourcing final ic test to test subcontractors that are not our customers or other factors  would adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers may cause significant fluctuations in our future annual and quarterly operating results 
the semiconductor equipment industry in general  and the test handler market in particular  is highly competitive 
the semiconductor test handler industry is intensely competitive and we face substantial competition from numerous companies throughout the world 
future competition may include companies that do not currently supply test handlers 
the japanese and korean markets for test handling equipment are large and represent a significant percentage of the worldwide market 
during the last five years we have had only limited sales to japanese and korean customers who have historically purchased test handling equipment from asian suppliers 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and customer support capabilities and offer more extensive product offerings than cohu 
in addition  there are emerging semiconductor equipment companies that provide or may provide innovative technology incorporated in products that may compete favorably against those of cohu 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and introduce new products with improved performance capabilities 
our failure to introduce new products in a timely manner  the introduction by our competitors of products with perceived or actual advantages  or disputes over rights of cohu or our competitors to use certain intellectual property or technology could result in a loss of our competitive position and reduced sales of or margins on our existing products 
we believe that competitive conditions in the semiconductor test handler market have intensified over the last several years 
this intense competition has adversely impacted our product average selling prices and gross margins 
if we are unable to reduce the cost of our existing products and successfully introduce new lower cost products we expect these competitive conditions to negatively impact our gross margin and operating results for the foreseeable future 
we are exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and investments 
cohu has made  and may in the future make  acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses with complementary products  services and or technologies 
in july   cohu acquired the assets of the automated systems business from schlumberger technologies  inc for million in cash 
a significant portion of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets 
in the fourth quarter of  cohu invested million in kryotech  inc preferred stock and million in intangible assets for certain technology 
acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks  including  but not limited to difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel  operations  technologies and products of acquired businesses  diversion of management s attention from other operational matters  the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses  lack of synergy  or the inability to realize expected synergies  resulting from the acquisition  failure to commercialize purchased technology  and the impairment of acquired intangible assets  including goodwill and equity investments  that could result in significant charges to operating results in future periods 
in addition  such acquisitions or investments may result in immediate charges to operating results 
mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect cohu s business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have taken and expect to continue to take remedial measures to address the slowdown in the semiconductor equipment industry that may affect our ability to be competitive 
we have taken and will continue to assess the need to take remedial measures to address the slowdown in the market for our products 
in particular  we reduced our workforce  including reductions in september and october  and january   delayed salary increases  reduced senior executives pay  implemented furloughs and reduced expense budgets 
further workforce reductions are possible if the current worldwide slowdown in demand for high technology products persists 
each of these measures could have long term effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent  decreasing or slowing improvements in our products and making it more difficult for us to respond to customers needs 
semiconductor equipment is subject to rapid technological change  product introductions and transitions may result in inventory write offs and our new product development involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
semiconductor equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological change 
we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to enhance existing products and develop new products with improved performance capabilities 
we expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development and must manage product transitions successfully  as introductions of new products could adversely impact sales or margins of existing products 
in addition  the introduction of new products by cohu or by our competitors  the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers  the migration to new ic test handling methodologies and the custom nature of our inventory parts increases the risk that our established products and related inventory may become obsolete  resulting in significant excess and obsolete inventory exposure 
this increased exposure resulted in significant charges to operations during the third and fourth quarters of and the first three quarters of future inventory write offs and increased inventory reserve requirements could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents the design  development  commercial introduction and manufacture of new semiconductor test handling equipment is an inherently complex process that involves a number of risks and uncertainties 
these risks include potential problems in meeting customer performance requirements  integration of the test handler with other suppliers equipment and the customers manufacturing processes  transitioning from product development to volume manufacturing and the ability of the equipment to satisfy the semiconductor industry s constantly evolving needs and achieve commercial acceptance at prices that produce satisfactory profit margins 
the design and development of new test handling equipment is heavily influenced by changes in integrated circuit ic assembly  test and final manufacturing processes and ic package design changes 
we believe that the rate of change in such processes and ic packages is accelerating 
as a result of these changes and other factors  assessing the market potential and commercial viability of new ic test handling equipment is extremely difficult and subject to a great deal of risk 
in addition  not all ic manufacturers employ the same manufacturing processes 
differences in such processes make it difficult to design standard semiconductor test handler products that are capable of achieving broad market acceptance 
as a result  we might not accurately assess the semiconductor industry s future test handler requirements and fail to design and develop products that meet such requirements and achieve market acceptance 
failure to accurately assess customer requirements and market trends for new semiconductor test handler products may have a material adverse impact on our operations  financial condition and results of operations 
the transition from product development to the manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is a difficult process and delays in product introductions and problems in manufacturing such equipment are common 
we have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing and volume production of our new test handlers 
in addition  our after sale support and warranty costs have been significantly higher with new test handlers than with our established products 
future technologies  processes and product developments may render our current or future product offerings obsolete and we might not be able to develop  introduce and successfully manufacture new products or make enhancements to our existing products in a timely manner to satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance 
furthermore  we might not realize acceptable profit margins on such products 
our backlog is limited and may not accurately reflect future business activity 
our order backlog has historically represented approximately three months of revenue and as a result our visibility of future business activity is limited 
our revenues in recent quarters were  however  lower than our backlog at the end of the preceding quarter 
due to the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules  cancellation of orders  potential delays in product shipments  difficulties in obtaining inventory parts from suppliers  failure to satisfy customer acceptance requirements and the inability to recognize revenue under accounting requirements  our backlog at any point in time may not be representative of sales in any future period 
in  we reduced backlog by approximately million due to customer cancellations 
furthermore  all orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer with limited penalty 
a reduction in backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  backlog at december   may not be a reliable indicator of revenues in future periods due to customer requested changes to delivery schedules  order cancellations and delays in recognizing revenue due to accounting requirements 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry places enormous demands on our employees  operations and infrastructure 
the semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by dramatic and sometimes volatile changes in demand for its products 
changes in product demand result from a number of factors including the semiconductor industry s ever changing and unpredictable capacity requirements and changes in ic design and packaging 
sudden changes in demand for semiconductor equipment have a significant impact on our operations 
in response to a severe industry downturn in  we reduced our total workforce by approximately 
during  we increased our workforce by more than as business conditions in the semiconductor equipment industry and our order backlog improved 
in  we reduced our workforce approximately as a result of a downturn in the semiconductor equipment industry 
workforce reductions have continued in the third and fourth quarter of and january  such radical changes in workforce levels place enormous demands on our employees  operations and infrastructure since newly hired personnel rarely possess the expertise and level of experience of current employees 
additionally  these transitions divert management time and attention from other activities and adversely impact employee morale 
we have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties  particularly in manufacturing  in training and recruiting the large number of additions to our workforce 
the volatility in headcount and business levels  combined with the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  may require that we invest substantial amounts in new operational and financial systems  procedures and controls 
we may not be able to successfully adjust our systems  facilities and production capacity to meet our customers changing requirements 
the inability to meet such requirements will have an adverse impact on our business  financial position and results of operations 

table of contents we have experienced a significant decline in gravity feed test handler sales to dram customers 
sales of gravity feed ic test handlers used in dram testing represented a significant percentage of cohu s total semiconductor equipment related revenue during the period through due to changes in ic package technology  gravity feed handlers are no longer suitable for handling many types of drams 
as a result  we have seen a significant decline in sales of our gravity feed test handler products that currently represent an insignificant percentage of our test handler revenues 
although pick and place ic handlers used in dram applications account for a significant portion of the worldwide ic handler market  cohu s market share in the dram segment is negligible 
while cohu s share of the gravity feed handler market is minimal  such handlers are used in numerous non dram applications and continue to represent a significant portion of the worldwide test handler market 
we are exposed to the risks of operating a global business 
cohu has operations located in various parts of the world to support our sales and services to the global semiconductor industry 
managing geographically dispersed operations presents difficult challenges associated with  among other things  organizational alignment and infrastructure  communications and information technology  inventory control  customer relationship management and cultural diversities 
in addition  maintaining these geographically dispersed locations is expensive 
we may not be able to manage our multiple operations in a cost effective and efficient manner 
if we are unsuccessful in managing such operations effectively  our business and results of operations will be adversely affected 
failure of critical suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely and cost effective manner could adversely impact our operations 
we use numerous vendors to supply parts  components and subassemblies for the manufacture of our products 
it is not always possible to maintain multiple qualified suppliers for all of our parts  components and subassemblies 
as a result  certain key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers 
in addition  suppliers may cease manufacturing certain components that are difficult to replace without significant reengineering of our products 
on occasion  cohu has experienced problems in obtaining adequate and reliable quantities of various parts and components from certain key suppliers 
our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our requirements in a timely and cost effective manner 
we are exposed to the risk that third parties may violate our proprietary rights or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietary rights 
cohu relies on patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products 
any of our proprietary rights may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and these rights may not provide significant competitive advantages 
in addition  from time to time  we receive notices from third parties regarding patent or copyright claims 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources and cause cohu to incur significant expenses 
in the event of a successful claim of infringement against cohu and our failure or inability to license the infringed technology or to substitute similar non infringing technology  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
a majority of our revenues are generated from exports to foreign countries  primarily in asia  that are subject to economic instability and we compete against a number of asian test handling equipment suppliers 
during  of our total net sales were exported to foreign countries  including of the sales in the semiconductor equipment segment 
the majority of our export sales are made to destinations in asia 
instability in global economic markets  particularly in asia  may adversely impact the demand for capital equipment  including equipment of the type manufactured and marketed by cohu 
in addition  we face intense competition from a number of asian suppliers that have certain advantages over us suppliers  including cohu 
these advantages include  among other things  proximity to customers  favorable tariffs and affiliation with significantly larger organizations 
in addition  changes in the amount or price of semiconductors produced in asia could impact the profitability or capital equipment spending programs of our foreign and domestic customers 
the loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business 
certain key personnel are critical to our business 
our future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of our key personnel  many of whom are not bound by employment or non competition agreements 
our future operating results also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management  manufacturing  technical  engineering  marketing  sales and support personnel 
competition for qualified personnel  particularly those with technical skills  is intense  and we cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel 
there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills and relevant industry experience to serve in these positions and it may be increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of our key employees  by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position  or by our inability to attract and retain skilled employees 

table of contents our non semiconductor equipment businesses have experienced little or no growth over the last five years 
we develop  manufacture and sell products used in closed circuit television  metal detection and microwave communications applications 
these products are sold in highly competitive markets and many competitors are segments of large  diversified companies with substantially greater financial  engineering  marketing  manufacturing and customer support capabilities than cohu 
in addition  there are smaller companies that provide or may provide innovative technology incorporated in products that may compete favorably against those of cohu 
we have seen a decline in the operating results of these businesses over the last several years and the future prospects for certain of these businesses remain uncertain 
we may not be able to continue to compete successfully in these businesses 
we have experienced increases in our electricity costs and we may be exposed to power shortages 
cohu is a significant user of electricity 
the state of california has deregulated the price of electricity 
deregulation combined with increases in the cost of generating electricity have resulted in a rise in cohu s electricity costs 
market forecasts predict significant increases in electricity prices in the future that will result in increased costs to cohu that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
in addition  our electricity costs have increased as a result of moving certain of our san diego operations to a significantly larger facility in poway  california in june  power shortages have caused blackouts throughout california and san diego county 
in march   cohu s operations were temporarily suspended as a result of a blackout 
we currently do not have back up generators or alternate sources of power in the event of a blackout 
further blackouts could result in our failure to meet customer delivery requirements damaging our reputation and resulting in lost revenue that would have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
new accounting rules may impact our future operating results 
in december   the staff of the securities and exchange commission issued sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
cohu adopted sab in the fourth quarter of  and  as required  changed its method of revenue recognition in certain instances 
as a result of this change  a cumulative effect adjustment was recorded in cohu s statement of income for the quarter ended march  further changes in revenue recognition practices resulting from initiatives by the fasb are possible 
in addition  the fasb is considering changing the accounting for stock based compensation 
such changes could result in additional adjustments to our results of operations that may be reflected in future periods 
we have experienced significant volatility in our stock price 
a variety of factors may cause the price of our stock to be volatile 
in recent years  the stock market in general  and the market for shares of high technology companies in particular  including ours  have experienced extreme price fluctuations  which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies 
during the last three years the price of our common stock has ranged from a closing high of to a closing low of 
the price of our stock may be more volatile than other companies due to  among other factors  the unpredictable and cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  our significant customer concentration  intense competition in the ic test handler industry  our limited backlog making earnings predictability difficult and our relatively low daily stock trading volume 
the market price of our common stock is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future  including fluctuations related and unrelated to our performance 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july   requires changes in some of our corporate governance and securities disclosure or compliance practices 
that act also requires the sec to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects  in addition to rule proposals already made  and nasdaq has proposed revisions to its requirements for companies that are nasdaq listed 
we expect these developments to increase our legal compliance costs  and to make some activities more difficult  such as stockholder approval of new stock option plans 
we expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these developments could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  or qualified executive officers 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
at december   our investment portfolio includes fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately million 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the relatively short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate ten percent change in interest rates eg to would have no material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we generally conduct business  including sales to foreign customers  in us dollars and as a result we have limited foreign currency exchange rate risk 
monetary assets and liabilities of cohu s foreign operations are not significant 
the effect of an immediate ten percent change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations
