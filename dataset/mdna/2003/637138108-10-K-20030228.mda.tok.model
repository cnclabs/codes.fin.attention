item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and is intended to assist in understanding and evaluating the major changes in the financial condition and earnings results of operations of the company with a primary focus on the company s performance 
financial condition during total assets increased to billion  an increase of million or over the billion at year end total assets at the end of increased million or over the billion at year end the increase in is reflected primarily in the loan category  the investment category and the cash and cash equivalent category  which increased million  million and million  respectively 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and the assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers that the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies 
the allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated credit losses 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including  among others  expected default probabilities  loss given default  expected commitment usage  the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  mortgages  and general amounts for historical loss experience 
the process also considers economic conditions  uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
all of these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
with the adoption of sfas no 
on january   the company discontinued the amortization of goodwill resulting from acquisitions 
goodwill is now subject to impairment testing at least annually to determine whether write downs of the recorded balances are necessary 
the company tests for impairment based on the goodwill maintained at each defined reporting unit 
a fair value is determined for each reporting unit based on at least one of three various market valuation methodologies 
if the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values  no write down of recorded goodwill is necessary 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less  an expense may be required on the company s books to write down the related goodwill to the proper carrying value 
as of june   the company completed its transitional testing which determined that no impairment write offs were necessary 
no assurance can be given that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax effects of temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
deferred tax assets are subject to management s judgment based upon available evidence that future realization is more likely than not 
if management determines that the company may be unable to realize all or part of net deferred tax assets in the future  a direct charge to income tax expense may be required to reduce the recorded value of the net deferred tax asset to the expected realizable amount 
loan portfolio net loans and leases including loans held for sale increased to billion during  an increase of million or compared to net loans increased million in or compared to loan growth in was as a result of the increase in commercial and industrial loans and leases  and loans to financial institutions of million and residential and other real estate type loans of million  which was offset by the decrease in non real estate loans to individuals of million and construction loans totaling million 
approximately million of the increase in net loans was the result of an acquisition of a branch office from wilmington savings fund society  in september residential mortgages originated for immediate resale during amounted to million 
the company has million in loans held for sale at december  the company has no significant exposure to energy and agricultural related loans 
the company s loans are widely diversified by borrower  industry group  and geographical area in southeastern pennsylvania  new jersey and virginia

in situations where a renewal is appropriate  the company s policy in this regard is to evaluate the credit for collectibility consistent with the normal loan evaluation process 
this policy is used primarily in evaluating ongoing customers use of their lines of credit that are at floating interest rates 
the company s outstanding lines of credit to customers total million 
risk elements loans a loan is placed in a nonaccrual status at the time when ultimate collectibility of principal or interest  wholly or partially  is in doubt 
past due loans are those loans which were contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments but are well secured and in the process of collection 
restructured loans are those loans which terms have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of principal or interest as a result of the deteriorating financial position of the borrower

nonaccrual loans represented million and million at december   and december   respectively 
loans days past due and still accruing interest were  and million at december  and december   respectively 
the decrease in the loans past due days or more category is due primarily to two large commercial real estate relationships that were resolved in additional discussion regarding this issue is set forth in the paragraph of this item titled allowance for loan losses on page other real estate owned was  at december  and million at december   respectively 
the company had no restructured loans at december  or december  the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming assets was and at december  and december   respectively  with the increase in due to the decreased level of nonperforming assets discussed above 
another measure of the company s credit quality is reflected by the ratio of net chargeoffs to total loans of for versus for the year  and the ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans of 
at december   compared to at december   the reasons for which have been discussed above 
net loan chargeoffs of million during was high compared to historical company results and peer averages 
of the million in net chargeoffs  million was a direct result of two large commercial real estate transactions  discussed in the loan portfolio section 
one of these transactions  after moving to other real estate  was completely liquidated 
the second has been charged down to the value of the remaining collateral 
based upon management s current information and analysis  it appears that no additional losses are expected on this loan 
the company has not engaged in any transactions with entities established and operated by former members of senior management or individuals with former management relationships with the company 
investment portfolio investments  which are the company s secondary use of funds  increased million or to million at year end the increase in is due primarily to investment purchases of million primarily in mortgage backed securities and municipals  and the securitization of approximately million of conforming residential loans through federal home loan mortgage corporation during the second quarter 
this resulted in the transfer of these loans from the company s loan portfolio to the investment portfolio where they are now held in the form of a mortgage backed security 
the purpose of this transaction was to provide greater liquidity for the loans as they are more readily saleable in the form of a security  as well as to provide collateral for the company s cash management and municipal deposit programs 
this increase was partially offset by investment sales  calls and maturities of and the amortization of mortgage backed securities 
in  the investment portfolio reflected an increase of million or compared to the increase in was due to the addition of million primarily in mortgage backed securities  which were partially offset by calls and maturities of securities  investment securities sales and payments on mortgage backed securities

net interest income is the difference between interest income on assets and interest expense on liabilities 
net interest income increased million or to million in from the amount of million 
interest income decreased million as a result of decreased loan income of million offset by an increase in investment income of million 
interest expense decreased million or to million in from the amount of million due to a decrease of million in interest on deposits and a decrease of million in borrowed funds 
despite the current low rate environment  the cost of attracting and holding deposited funds is an ever increasing expense in the banking industry 
these increases are the real costs of deposit accumulation and retention  including fdic insurance costs  marketing and branch overhead expenses 
such costs are necessary for continued growth and to maintain and increase market share of available deposits 
the company s interest rate margin increased slightly from in to in due to increased outstandings in interest earning assets and from which the income generated on these assets decreased due to lower rates at a slower pace than on the increased level of interest bearing liabilities for which the expense paid on those liabilities decreased  also due to lower rates  at a faster pace than on the assets

allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses is determined by periodic reviews of loan quality  current economic conditions  loss experience and loan growth 
based on these factors  the provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december  and million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses of million at year end and million at year end as a percentage of total loans was at year end and at year end net loan chargeoffs of million in were high compared to historical company results of million and million during and  respectively  and high also compared to peer averages 
of the million in net chargeoffs  million was a direct result of two large commercial real estate transactions  discussed in the loan portfolio section 
the increase in loan chargeoffs in compared to np bank s prior experience was the direct result of two large commercial real estate loans involving the borrowers misrepresentation of their loan information to the bank 
to strengthen np bank s credit administration process  np bank has enhanced its lending policies  and allocated additional resources to oversee its underwriting procedures 
management continues to believe its loan loss allowance is adequate to cover future losses 
a detailed analysis of the company s allowance for loan losses for the five years ended december   is shown below december  balance at beginning of year      charge offs commercial and industrial loans      real estate loans construction and land development   residential     other   loans to individuals    total charge offs      recoveries commercial and industrial  real estate loans construction and land development residential other  loans to individuals total recoveries      net charge offs      provision charged to expense      adjustments changes incident to mergers and absorptions  net  balance at end of year      ratio of net charge offs during the period to average loans outstanding during the period commercial and industrial loans  real estate loans  and construction loans are charged off to the allowance as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all or part of the principal balance is highly unlikely 
loans to individuals are charged off any time repayment is deemed highly unlikely or as soon as the loan becomes days delinquent 
because all identified losses are immediately charged off  no portion of the allowance for loan losses is restricted to any individual loan or groups of loans  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan losses 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses at a level deemed sufficient to absorb losses  which are inherent in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on at least a quarterly basis to ensure that the provision for loan losses has been charged against earnings in an amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level that is appropriate based on management s assessment of probable estimated losses 
the company s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of several key elements 
these elements include a specific reserve for doubtful or high risk loans  an allocated reserve based on historical trends  and an unallocated portion 
the company consistently applies the following comprehensive methodology 
the specific reserve for high risk loans is established for specific commercial and industrial loans  real estate development loans  and construction loans which have been identified by bank management as being high risk loan assets 
these high risk loans are assigned a doubtful risk rating grade because the loan has not performed according to payment terms and there is reason to believe that repayment of the loan principal in whole or part is unlikely 
the specific portion of the allowance is the total amount of potential unconfirmed losses for these individual doubtful loans 
to assist in determining the fair value of loan collateral  the company often utilizes independent third party qualified appraisal firms which in turn employ their own criteria and assumptions that may include occupancy rates  rental rates  and property expenses  among others 
the second category of reserves consists of the allocated portion of the allowance 
the allocated portion of the allowance is determined by taking pools of loans outstanding and commitments that have similar characteristics and applying historical loss experience for each pool 
this estimate represents the potential unconfirmed losses within the portfolio 
individual loan pools are created for commercial loans  real estate development and construction loans  and for the various types of loans to individuals 
the historical estimation for each loan pool is then adjusted to account for current conditions  current loan portfolio performance  loan policy or management changes or any other factor  which may cause future losses to deviate from historical levels 
before applying the historical loss experience percentages  loan balances are reduced by the portion of the loan balances  which  are subject to a guarantee by a government agency 
the company also maintains an unallocated allowance 
the unallocated allowance is used to cover any factors or conditions  which may cause a potential loan loss but are not specifically identifiable 
it is prudent to maintain an unallocated portion of the allowance because no matter how detailed an analysis of potential loan losses is performed these estimates by definition lack precision 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information  which is often subjective and changing rapidly 
at december   management believes that the allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans remained safely within acceptable levels the following table shows how the allowance for loan losses is allocated among the various types of loans that the company has outstanding 
this allocation is based on management s specific review of the credit risk of the outstanding loans in each category as well as historical trends

other income and expenses other income increased million or in compared to  as a result of increased service charges on deposit accounts of million  increased mortgage banking income of million  increased bank owned life insurance income of  increased other services charges and fees of  and increased trust income of  the increase in deposit fees is due to the increase in the number of accounts and additional products introduced in mortgage income increased due to the decrease in rates and the willingness of customers to refinance

other expenses increased million or in compared to as a result of increased salaries  wages and benefits of million and increased other operating expenses of million 
other operating expenses increased in part due to the write down of a minority ownership interest in a non banking  non public financial services business 
at the time of the company s investment  this business appeared to be an opportunity for the company to continue to focus on specialized niche markets 
the business has been unable to accomplish its business plan and the company elected to terminate its investment in this business 
the company has no other material  similar types of investments 
the company also wrote off the unamortized issuance costs of  related to the redemption of the preferred securities 
salaries  wages and benefits increased due to increased staff and increases in benefit costs 
other expenses increased million or in when compared to  as a result of increased salaries  wages and benefits of million  increased other expenses of million

income before income taxes increased in by million or compared to  when income before income taxes increased by million compared to income taxes increased million in compared to while income taxes increased million compared to the company s effective tax rate is for  for  and for  respectively 
the increase from to is due to the decrease in tax advantaged income as a percent of taxable income 
the effective tax rate is less than the current incremental rate due to the company s investments in tax advantaged municipal securities and bank owned life insurance 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets 
these statements modify the company s accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
modifies the accounting for all purchased goodwill and intangible assets 
as of january   the company is no longer amortizing its goodwill 
had the company not been required to amortize goodwill  reported earnings per share would have been higher on a diluted basis or per share versus the per share actually reported for the twelve months ended december  sfas no 
includes requirements to test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment rather than amortize them 
the company will be testing goodwill for impairment at least annually 
for the testing completed as of june   the company had no impairment of goodwill 
no assurance can be given that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
liquidity and interest rate sensitivity the primary functions of asset liability management are to assure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs 
funding affecting short term liquidity  including deposits  repurchase agreements  federal funds purchased  and short term borrowings increased million during long term borrowings increased million during the company currently does not have any unconsolidated subsidiaries or off balance sheet special purpose entities 
the goal of interest rate sensitivity management is to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
such sensitivity is measured as the difference in the volume of assets and liabilities in the existing portfolio that are subject to repricing in a future time period 
the following table shows separately the interest rate sensitivity of each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december repricing periods within three months one year over three through through five months one year five years years in thousands assets interest bearing deposits at banks  federal funds sold  investment securities     loans and leases     other assets  liabilities and equity non interest bearing deposits  interest bearing deposits     borrowed funds    preferred securities  other liabilities  hedging instruments    shareholders equity  interest sensitivity gap     cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap    adjustable rate loans are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they are due 
fixed rate loans are included in the period in which they are scheduled to be repaid and are adjusted to take into account estimated prepayments based upon assumptions estimating the prepayments in the interest rate environment prevailing during the fourth calendar quarter of the table assumes prepayments and scheduled principal amortization of fixed rate loans and mortgage backed securities  and assumes that adjustable rate mortgages will reprice at contractual repricing intervals 
there has been no adjustment for the impact of future commitments and loans in process 
savings and now deposits are scheduled for repricing based on historical deposit decay rate analyses  as well as historical moving averages of run off for the company s deposits in these categories 
while generally subject to immediate withdrawal  management considers a portion of these accounts to be core deposits having significantly longer effective maturities based upon the company s historical retention of such deposits in changing interest rate environments 
specifically  of these deposits are considered repriceable within three months and are considered repriceable in the over five year category 
includes federal funds purchased  securities sold under repurchase agreements  and short and long term borrowings 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the company s assets and liabilities 
these characteristics include the volume of assets and liabilities repricing  the timing of the repricing  and the relative levels of repricing 
attempting to minimize the interest rate sensitivity gaps is a continual challenge in a changing rate environment 
based on the company s gap position as reflected in the above table  current accepted theory would indicate that net interest income would decrease in a falling interest rate environment and would increase in a rising interest rate environment 
an interest rate gap table does not  however  present a complete picture of the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
first  changes in the general level of interest rates do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
second  assets and liabilities which can contractually reprice within the same period may not  in fact  reprice at the same time or to the same extent 
third  the table represents a one day position  variations occur daily as the company adjusts its interest sensitivity throughout the year 
fourth  assumptions must be made to construct such a table 
for example  non interest bearing deposits are assigned a repricing interval of within three months  although history indicates a significant amount of these deposits will not move into interest bearing categories regardless of the general level of interest rates 
finally  the repricing distribution of interest sensitive assets may not be indicative of the liquidity of those assets 
gap analysis is a useful measurement of asset and liability management  however  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates based solely on this measure 
therefore  the company supplements gap analysis with the calculation of the economic value of equity 
this report forecasts changes in the company s market value of portfolio equity mvpe under alternative interest rate environments 
the mvpe is defined as the net present value of the company s existing assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet instruments 
the calculated estimates of change in mvpe at december  are as follows mvpe change in interest rate amount change in thousands basis points  basis points  basis points  flat rate  basis points  basis points  basis points  management believes that the assumptions utilized in evaluating the vulnerability of the company s earnings and capital to changes in interest rates approximate actual experience  however  the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on mvpe could vary substantially if different assumptions are used  such as or basis point changes in interest rates  or actual experience differs from the experience on which the assumptions were based 
if the company should experience a mismatch in its desired gap ranges or an excessive decline in its mvpe subsequent to an immediate and sustained change in interest rate  it has a number of options which it could utilize to remedy such mismatch 
the company could restructure its investment portfolio through the sale or purchase of securities with more favorable repricing attributes 
it could also emphasize loan products with appropriate maturities or repricing attributes  or it could emphasize deposits or obtain borrowings with desired maturities 
the company anticipates interest rate levels will remain stable in the first half of  and will rise in the second half of given this assumption  the company s asset liability strategy for is to maintain the positive gap position interest bearing assets subject to repricing more than interest earning liabilities subject to repricing for periods up to a year 
the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income is not expected to be significant to the company s results of operations 
effective monitoring of these interest sensitivity gaps is the priority of the company s asset liability management committee
