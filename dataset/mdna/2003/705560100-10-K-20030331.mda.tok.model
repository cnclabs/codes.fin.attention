item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
except for historical information  the discussion below contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of company overview and industry outlook peet s is a specialty coffee roaster and marketer of branded fresh roasted whole bean coffee sold through multiple channels of distribution 
since the founding of our business in  we have established a customer base and brand recognition in california 
our national expansion strategy is based on the sale of whole bean coffee in multiple channels of distribution 
while we intend to continue the sale of whole bean coffee through strategically located retail stores  we expect revenue in our other distribution channels  namely grocery stores  online and mail order and office  restaurant and food service accounts  to increase at a more rapid rate 
we are also continuing to explore opportunities internationally through strategic relationships 
we expect the specialty coffee industry to continue to grow 
we believe that this growth will be fueled by continued consumer interest in high quality coffee and related products 
our operations are vertically integrated 
we purchase arabica coffee beans from countries around the world  apply our artisan roasting techniques and ship fresh coffee daily to our stores and customers within hours of roasting 
control of purchasing  roasting  packaging and distribution of our coffee allows us to maintain our commitment to freshness  is cost effective and enhances our margins and profit potential 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies inventory 
raw materials consist primarily of green bean coffee 
finished goods include roasted coffee  tea  accessory products  spices  and packaged foods 
all products are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method  except green bean and roasted coffee  which is valued at the average cost 
we continually evaluate the composition of our coffee related merchandise and mark down such inventory as needed 
our historical inventory write offs have been immaterial 
intangibles and other assets 
during  we entered into a contractual agreement with safeway inc  a national grocery chain  to sell peet s coffee through its grocery stores 
we began shipping during the third quarter of this year 
the agreement included an upfront payment to safeway inc that we recorded in intangibles and other assets and is being amortized as a reduction of revenue based upon estimated sales during the contract period 
long lived assets 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of long lived assets  we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related long lived asset and reduce their carrying value by the excess  if any  of the result of such calculation 
we believe at this time that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives continue to be appropriate 
accrued compensation 
in march  we modified our workers compensation insurance policy to a high deductible insurance program with an overall program ceiling to minimize exposure 
we began recording an estimated liability for the self insured portion of the workers compensation claims 
the liability is determined actuarially  based on claims paid  filed and reserved for  and projected using an industry loss development factor  as well as using historical experience ratings 
as of december   the first months of the policy period  we had  accrued for workers compensation 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the medical costs increase beyond what was anticipated  the recorded liability may not be sufficient 
income taxes 
we have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and charitable contribution carryforwards 
the utilization of these carryforwards is dependent on future income 
we have established a valuation allowance for the portion of the carryforwards that we do not expect to utilize 
although we believe the valuation allowance is appropriate  if future taxable income were to differ significantly from the amounts estimated  the valuation allowance would need to be adjusted 
hedge accounting 
we use coffee futures and options to hedge price increases in price to be fixed coffee purchase commitments and anticipated coffee purchases 
these derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting which is permitted if the hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective 
effectiveness is determined by how closely the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument offset the changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
if the derivative is determined to qualify for hedge accounting  the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument is recorded in other comprehensive income and recognized in earnings when the related hedged item is sold 
the ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument is recorded directly to earnings 
if these derivative instruments did not qualify for hedge accounting  we would have to record the changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments directly to earnings 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note hedging activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we have also chosen certain accounting policies when options are available  including the intrinsic value method under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  to account for our stock option awards 
these accounting policies are applied consistently for all years presented 
our operating results would be affected if other alternatives were used 
information about the impact on our operating results of using the alternative of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  is included in note summary of significant accounting policies and note stock option and employee purchase plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
business segments our coffee and related items are sold through multiple channels of distribution that are considered separate segments under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
these channels provide broad market exposure to potential purchasers of fresh roasted whole bean coffee 
historically  we have operated in three reportable segments retail  online and mail order and specialty sales 
management evaluates segment performance primarily based on revenue and segment operating income 
effective at the beginning of the second quarter of  due to the nature of cross channel marketing and consumer purchase behavior from our multi channel selling strategy  we have had an organizational change  combining the online and mail order segment and the specialty sales segment 
we are indifferent as to where consumers purchase our coffees and teas  so we have aggregated these individual sales channels into one reportable segment 
company operated retail stores operations remain a separate channel due to the beverage component of this business and the percent of overall revenues it represents 
therefore  we have two reportable segments  consisting of our retail stores  and specialty sales  which consist of sales to online and mail order customers  and sales to grocery stores  restaurant and food service companies  and office accounts 
we believe growth opportunities exist in all these channels 
our expansion is focused first in developing the western us existing markets where we already have a presence and have a higher customer awareness 
we will continue to open new stores in strategic locations that meet our demographic profile in these markets  make our coffees more broadly and conveniently located in grocery stores  and partner with distributors and companies who share our passion for quality and freshness and are willing and able to execute accordingly in the food service and office environment 
we also will penetrate new markets and channels that we believe can support the sale of specialty coffee  and continue to explore opportunities internationally 
business categories in addition to our reportable segments  we measure our business by monitoring the volume and revenue growth of two distinct business categories whole bean coffee and related products  and beverages and pastries 
we believe these business categories are useful in understanding our results of operations for the periods presented because we operate our stores and record sales through these two categories 
our stores are primarily designed to facilitate the sale of whole bean coffee 
the format of our stores replicates that of a specialty grocer 
beans are scooped from under the counter bins  weighed on counter top scales and hand packed into branded bags 
in addition  each store has a beverage bar that is dedicated to the sale of prepared beverages and pastries 
moreover  our two business categories within a store mature at different rates 
when we open a store  the initial sales are primarily beverage and pastry related 
the distance a consumer will travel  or trade area  for beverages and pastries is short usually one to three miles representing a convenience purchase 
consequently  the beverage and pastry business matures rapidly 
the trade area for whole bean coffee is much larger usually three to five miles  representing destination shopping 
whole bean sales from stores mature more slowly typically three to five years 
therefore  sales at newer stores have a much higher beverage and pastry component and shift to a higher whole bean percentage as the store matures 
in  whole bean coffee and related products sales from stores opened for less than years was of net revenue versus for stores opened for more than years 
the dynamics of opening many new stores over the past few years have resulted in a higher beverage and pastry percentage within our net revenue 
results of operations the following discussion on results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial data  the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and the other financial data included elsewhere in this report 
our fiscal year is based on a or week year 
the fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to the last day of december 
year statement of operations data as a percent of net revenue net revenue cost of sales and related occupancy expenses operating expenses marketing and advertising expenses general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization expenses income loss from operations interest income expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss percent of net revenue by business segment retail stores specialty sales percent of net revenue by business category whole bean coffee and related products beverages and pastries operating expenses as a percent of segment revenue retail stores specialty sales percent increase decrease from prior year net revenue retail stores specialty sales cost of sales and related occupancy expenses operating expenses marketing and advertising expenses general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization expenses selected operating data number of retail stores in operation beginning of the period stores openings store closure end of the period compared with net revenue net revenue for increased by for the two business segments and categories as compared to during  we continued our strategy of selling through multiple channels of distribution 
a key element of our strategy involves increasing the percentage of revenue from sales of whole bean coffee and related products  which have a higher net margin than beverages and pastries 
by accelerating growth in the specialty sales segment  especially in the grocery and foodservice channels  revenue derived from the sale of whole bean coffee and related products as a percent of net revenue increased from in to in in the retail segment  revenue increased compared to primarily as a result of increased sales in existing stores and the opening of new retail stores 
the million revenue increase consisted of million from existing stores and million from new stores 
the revenue increase of million in existing stores was due to increased traffic and million was due to higher average sales transactions 
there were no price increases during the year 
during  we opened five new stores compared to two stores opened in one store was opened during the third quarter while the remaining four stores were opened during the fourth quarter 
we opened more new stores in as we saw the cost and availability of real estate become more favorable in we expect to open approximately new stores in in the specialty sales segment  revenue increased primarily due to sales initiatives focused in the grocery and foodservice channels 
the million revenue increase consists of million in grocery  million in foodservice  and million in all other channels such as online and mail order  kiosks and license partners  and office coffee sales 
the accelerated growth in grocery was the result of developing relationships with larger multi location chains such as safeway inc and whole foods markets 
we increased the number of grocery stores selling peet s coffee from locations in to over  in in  we entered into an agreement with safeway to distribute our coffees to approximately  safeway stores across the country 
in july  we rolled out distribution to approximately stores in the western united states  including california  colorado  pacific northwest  arizona  and new mexico 
in september  we rolled out distribution to the remaining stores in the eastern united states  including texas  illinois  and pennsylvania 
we expect to expand this sales effort to grocers with similar profiles in the next few years 
in the foodservice area  the sales increase was due to acquisition of new customers like the omni hotel and the full year impact of existing customers like wolfgang puck fine dining and anton airfoods 
in the other channels  including online and mail order  office coffee  and kiosk operations  the sales increase was entirely attributable the full year impact of our kiosk operations in larry s markets 
cost of sales and related occupancy expenses cost of sales and related occupancy expenses consist of product costs  including hedging costs  manufacturing costs  rent and other occupancy costs 
primarily as a result of increased net revenue and the addition of five new stores  cost of sales increased by in as a percent of net revenue  cost of sales decreased mainly because of lower coffee costs  lower world commodity coffee prices and the sales of special lot and seasonal coffees  which have a higher margin than regular menu coffees 
these benefits were partially offset by the increase in revenue from the specialty sales segment  which has a lower price point than retail and higher shipping and packaging costs 
operating expenses operating expenses for increased as compared to as we grew our business 
however  operating expenses as a percent of net revenue decreased primarily due to the continued productivity initiative affecting our retail stores and the revenue increase in our specialty sales segment  which has lower operating expenses without the intensive labor component of the retail stores 
our focus on growing the specialty sales segment led to an increase in specialty sales operating expenses as a percent of segment revenue 
the factors contributing to the increase included the continued upgrade and addition of sales staff and an increase in consulting and distribution costs in the grocery channel 
we hired a sales brokerage firm to aide us in selling coffee in the grocery channel 
further  distribution expenses have increased as we have dedicated dsd route sales representatives delivering our product to grocery stores weekly  including the associated commission and vehicle expenses 
we expect to have approximately dsd route sales representatives in  of which approximately will be full time peet s employees  to support the expansion into grocery stores in the western united states as well as existing accounts  such as safeway and whole foods markets 
the related operating expenses  such as commissions and vehicle expenses  are expected to increase  however  we believe the increased revenue will positively offset these expenses over time 
marketing and advertising expenses we believe the decrease in marketing and advertising expenses in as compared to is attributable to the leverage gained from marketing across multiple channels of distribution  as well as the shift in spending to improve stores operations  recognizing stores are our most valuable marketing tool 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by in as the result of higher expenses in the areas of stock plan administration  public relations and proxy related activities  higher insurance coverage for directors and officers  and our ceo search 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses decreased in due primarily to certain assets becoming fully depreciated during the year 
in addition  while we opened more stores than last year  depreciation expense was minimally impacted as most of the stores were opened in the fourth quarter 
interest income expense  net net interest income was generated in from the investment of the proceeds of our secondary offering in april the investments are short and long term interest bearing  us government and agency securities 
income tax provision taxes on net income in were million  reflecting an effective tax rate of 
the decrease in the effective rate over the prior year is attributable to the change in the valuation allowance of charitable contributions carryforwards 
compared with net revenue net revenue for increased as compared to revenue derived from the sale of whole bean coffee and related products as a percent of net revenue actually decreased slightly in from to  primarily as a result of the opening of eighteen retail stores over the past three years 
in the retail segment  revenue increased primarily as a result of increased sales in existing stores  price increases on whole bean coffee and beverages and pastries effective in december  the opening of new retail stores and the introduction of a line of high end reserve coffees 
during  we opened two new stores compared to five stores opened in one was in studio city  southern california  and the other was in wellesley  massachusetts 
we opened fewer new stores in because the cost and availability of real estate was less attractive during and the first half of the following table sets forth the sources of revenue increases in by business category for the retail segment in millions 
increased volume and change in mix of whole bean coffee price increase in december total existing stores total new stores total whole bean coffee and related products increased volume of beverages and pastries price increase in december total existing stores total new stores total beverages and pastries in the specialty sales segment  revenue increased primarily due to increases from the grocery and online and mail order channels 
the million increase consisted of million increase in sales to online and mail order customers  million in incremental sales to specialty groceries and gourmet food stores  million in sales to restaurants and food service companies  and million in additional sales to office accounts and larry s market kiosks 
in the online and mail order channel  our marketing efforts resulted in a increase in active customer during in the grocery channel  we increased the number of specialty grocery and gourmet food stores from in to over in  including multi location chains such as von s pavilion and beverages more 
in the restaurant and food service area  we entered into agreements with companies such as the wolfgang puck fine dining and catering group and anton airfoods 
we also began operations of kiosks within larry s markets  a specialty grocery chain in seattle 
cost of sales and related occupancy expenses cost of sales increased by in primarily as a result of increased net revenue and the addition of two new stores 
the lower cost of green bean coffee was partially offset by higher hedging costs 
cost of sales actually decreased as a percent of net revenue mainly because of the december price increase  which resulted in a higher average sale at our retail store beverage bars and a higher price per pound of whole bean coffee purchased at our retail stores and by online and mail order customers  sales of high end reserve coffees  which have a higher margin than regular menu coffees  and fewer new stores opened during these benefits were partially offset by the increase in revenue from the specialty sales segment  which has a lower price point than retail and a higher shipping cost 
operating expenses operating expenses as a percent of net revenue decreased primarily due to the increase in our net revenue  a more favorable hiring environment  and a productivity improvement initiative affecting our retail stores 
this included programs to increase efficiency in our bar operations and a more standardized scheduling practice 
our focus on growing the specialty sales segment led to an increase in specialty sales operating expenses as a percent of segment revenue 
the factors contributing to the increase included the payroll expense of new sales staff for the grocery segment expansion  their travel and related expenses  the expenses related to distribution  and the pre opening and startup costs related to the opening of kiosks in larry s markets stores in seattle 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in payroll  order processing and outside services expenses in the online and mail order channel 
marketing and advertising expenses the decrease in marketing and advertising expenses in as compared to is attributable to the leverage gained from marketing across multiple channels of distribution  a shift from customer acquisition to customer retention  which is generally more cost effective  and fewer new store openings in general and administrative expenses we were able to reduce our general and administrative expenses as a percent of net revenue in as compared to primarily by maintaining prior year employee base levels and lowering recruiting expenses in a less competitive job market 
our efforts to reduce general and administrative expenses were partially offset by higher outside services expenses related to stock plan administration and public relations activities associated with being a publicly held company 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased in as compared to due to the openings of new stores and kiosks and investments in manufacturing and systems 
however  as a percent of net revenue  these expenses decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to fewer stores being opened as well as the increase in revenue from the less capital intensive specialty sales channel 
interest expense  net net interest expense decreased in as compared to as a result of repayment of debt using the net proceeds from our initial public offering in january income tax provision benefit taxes on net income in were million  reflecting an effective tax rate of 
the increase in the effective rate over the prior year is attributable to the increase in income and the change in the valuation allowance of charitable contributions carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  invested in us government and agency securities  and million working capital 
net cash provided by operations was million in compared to million in operating cash flows were positively impacted in by increased net income and higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the increase was partially offset by an increase in green coffee bean inventory as we increased our purchases in response to historically low coffee prices and potential longshoremen lockout in the west coast 
net cash used in investing activities was million in investing activities primarily consisted of the purchase of million of long term us government and agency securities  and million in capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment 
capital expenditures included million used for the buildout of new stores and remodel of existing stores  million used for information technology support systems  and software to support our growing infrastructure  million used for kiosks and equipment for specialty sales  million used for manufacturing plant capacity and additional machinery  and million for various projects in progress 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in financing activities in consisted primarily of million in net proceeds received from our secondary public offering in april and exercise of stock options  partially offset by million of repayment of debt 
we have a credit facility with general electric capital corporation  that provides for a revolving line of credit of million that expires in at december   there was no outstanding balance and million available under the revolving line of credit after other senior funded debt of million  consisting of industrial development revenue bonds and capital leases 
due to the significant repayment of debt from the net proceeds of our initial public offering  we amended our existing credit facility in june and march effective december   december effective october   and february effective december  to reflect our updated cash and capital requirements 
the march  december  and february amendments include an increase in the capital expenditure limit  an increase in the number of new stores per year  and a relaxation of certain financial covenants 
in addition  interest rates on the revolving line of credit have been reduced 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of december  see note borrowings in the notes to consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
our capital expenditure requirements consist primarily of expenditures relating to new store openings  remodeling of existing stores  upgrade of our packaging system  and continued improvement of our data processing capabilities 
our capital expenditures are expected to be between and million 
approximately million is expected to be used for the opening of eight new retail stores scheduled for and expenditures for new stores in progress for approximately million is expected to be used for purchase of new packaging equipment 
the remaining million is expected to be used for the remodeling of existing stores  equipment for the grocery channel  and information technology enhancements 
payments due by period in thousands less than contractual obligations total year years years after years industrial development revenue bonds capital lease obligations equipment leases retail store operating leases      fixed price coffee purchase commitments    total contractual cash obligations      in addition  as of december   we have an outstanding standby letter of credit of million backing the long term borrowings 
we expect cash flows from operations  cash and investments  and borrowing capacity under our current line of credit to be sufficient for our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months and to meet our contractual obligations as they come due 
however  we may require or desire additional funds to support our capital requirements or for other purposes  such as acquisitions or for competitive reasons  and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms  if at all 
our future liquidity and cash requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the implementation and success of our business strategy  competitive conditions in the specialty coffee market  and general economic conditions 
please see risk factors below for a discussion of the risks that may affect our revenue and operations 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operation in recent years 
however  we cannot predict what effect inflation may have on our results of operation in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our outstanding bank debt 
our revolving line of credit bears interest at certain applicable margin levels contingent upon our leverage ratio on a quarterly basis 
the interest rate  which is either the index rate the higher of prime or basis points over the average of rates for overnight federal funds transactions plus a range from to or a rate equal to libor plus a range from to  increases as our leverage ratio increases 
adjustments to the applicable margin level are implemented quarterly on a prospective basis 
the interest cost of our bank debt is affected by changes in either prime  federal funds rates  or libor 
such changes could adversely impact our cost of borrowing 
the supply and price of coffee are subject to significant volatility and can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries  including weather  political and economic conditions 
in addition  green coffee bean prices have been affected in the past  and may be affected in the future  by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence commodity prices of green coffee beans through agreements establishing export quotas or restricting coffee supplies worldwide 
our hedging strategy is intended to limit the cost exposure of the main commodity used in our business  green coffee beans 
we use the following instruments to manage coffee supply and price risk fixed price purchase commitments  coffee futures  and coffee futures options 
we use coffee futures and coffee futures options to reduce the price risk of our coffee purchase requirements that we cannot make or have not made on a contractual basis 
these coffee futures and coffee futures options are traded on the new york coffee  sugar cocoa exchange 
we use these futures and options solely for financial hedging purposes and never take actual delivery of the coffee traded on the exchange 
fixed price purchase commitments we enter into fixed price purchase commitments in order to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee beans and fix our cost of green coffee beans 
these commitments are made with established coffee brokers and are denominated in us dollars 
as of december   we had approximately million in open fixed priced purchase commitments with delivery dates ranging from january through november we believe  based on relationships established with our suppliers in the past  that the risk of non delivery on such purchase commitments is low 
coffee futures a coffee future is a contract to buy  pounds of green coffee beans at a contracted price and date 
the price of coffee traded on the exchange is known as the new york c market price 
we buy higher quality coffee that trades at premiums to the new york c market price 
although this premium varies depending on the supply and demand at the time of purchase  generally  the price of the coffee we purchase tends to fluctuate with the new york c market price 
this allows us to use coffee futures and coffee futures options to manage our exposure to price fluctuations 
we use coffee futures to hedge the price of anticipated coffee purchases to achieve a target gross margin for roasted coffee 
we convert this margin requirement into an equivalent new york c market price for green coffee beans  which we call our threshold 
when the current new york c market price is below our threshold  we may purchase coffee futures to fix the cost of our anticipated needs 
once we contract to purchase coffee from the supplier at a fixed price  we sell the related future 
if market prices decline  we forego potential additional gross margin and incur potential cash margin calls 
however  we are comfortable with this cost structure and enjoy the security of reduced risk 
coffee futures options when the current new york c market price is above our threshold  we may purchase coffee futures options to limit the cost exposure for our anticipated needs 
a coffee futures option is an option to buy a coffee future at a specific price  known as a trade price 
the cost of the option is based on the relationship of the trade price to the current new york c market price 
when we commit to purchase a specified quantity of green coffee beans and do not fix a price  we will hedge this not yet priced purchase commitment by purchasing a coffee futures option 
this coffee futures option locks in a specific price for the not yet priced purchase commitment but does not obligate us to take delivery on the contract 
if market prices rise  we realize gains on the coffee futures option  which offset the increase in price we have to pay for the coffee beans 
if the market prices decline  we will set the contract price of the not yet priced purchase commitment at the market price and we will let the option expire  taking advantage of the declining market 
we also use coffee futures options to hedge anticipated coffee purchases 
when the current new york c market price is above our threshold  we may purchase coffee futures options to limit the risk that coffee prices will continue to rise 
if market prices rise  the higher prices of our future fixed price coffee commitments will be offset by gains from the option 
if market prices decline  our future fixed price coffee commitments will be set at lower prices and the option will expire resulting in no further liability or obligation 
the extent of our coffee futures and coffee futures options positions at any given time depends on the amount of coffee we have contracted to purchase and general market conditions and trends 
we anticipate continuing this hedging strategy for the foreseeable future 
we held no coffee futures options as of december  and we did not enter into any coffee futures options during or our hedging positions are only placed by the chief financial officer through one brokerage firm that we believe to be reputable 
the following table reflects the outstanding coffee futures hedging positions as of december  and december  contract trade settlement number of contracts month price price gain loss may  unrealized gain as of december   may  unrealized loss as of december   these derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting 
the effective portion of the gains and losses are accounted for as inventory costs and are recorded as expense or income when the related coffee is sold 
the ineffective portion is recorded as an expense or income immediately 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board  fasb  issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provision of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of business 
sfas no

in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit of disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs 
sfas no 
supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally emerging issues task force issue no 
the company will adopt the provision of sfas no 
for restructuring activities initiated after december  sfas no 
requires that liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost is recognized at the date of a company s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas no 
may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by the guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   while  the provisions of the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the adoption of the measurement provisions of fin is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
risk factors we may not be successful in the implementation of our business strategy or our business strategy may not be successful  either of which will impede our growth and operating results 
our business strategy emphasizes the expansion of our non retail distribution channels including grocery stores  online and mail order  and office  restaurant and food service accounts 
this business strategy represents a shift from our historic business strategy  which largely emphasized opening and operating retail stores 
despite the change in our strategy  our retail stores  which generated nearly of our net revenue  continue to be an important element of our business 
we do not know whether we will be able to successfully implement our business strategy or whether our business strategy will be successful 
our ability to implement this business strategy is dependent on our ability to market our products on a national or international scale and over the internet  enter into distribution and other strategic arrangements with third party retailers and other potential distributors of our coffee  increase our brand recognition on a national and international scale  identify and lease strategic locations suitable for new stores  and manage growth in administrative overhead and distribution costs likely to result from the planned expansion of our retail and non retail distribution channels 
our revenue may be adversely affected if we fail to implement our business strategy or if we divert resources to a business strategy that ultimately proves unsuccessful 
because our business is centered on a single product  specialty coffee  if the demand for specialty coffee decreases  our business could suffer 
sales of specialty coffee constituted nearly of our net revenue 
demand for specialty coffee is affected by many factors  including consumer tastes and preferences  national  regional and local economic conditions  and demographic trends 
because we are highly dependent on consumer demand for specialty coffee  a shift in consumer preferences away from specialty coffee would harm our business more than if we had more diversified product offerings 
if customer demand for specialty coffee decreases  our sales would decrease accordingly 
if we fail to continue to develop and maintain our brand  our business could suffer 
we believe that maintaining and developing our brand is critical to our success and that the importance of brand recognition may increase as a result of competitors offering products similar to ours 
because the majority of our retail stores are located on the west coast  primarily in california  our brand recognition remains largely regional 
our brand building initiative involves increasing the availability of our products  increasing marketing expenditures and opening new stores in flagship locations to increase awareness of our brand and create and maintain brand loyalty 
if our brand building initiative is unsuccessful  we may never recover the expenses incurred in connection with these efforts and we may be unable to increase our future revenue or implement our business strategy 
our success in promoting and enhancing the peet s brand will also depend on our ability to provide customers with high quality products and customer service 
although we take measures to ensure that we sell only fresh roasted whole bean coffee and or retail employees properly prepare our coffee beverages  we have no control over our whole bean coffee products once purchased by customers 
accordingly  customers may prepare coffee from our whole bean coffee inconsistent with our standards  store our whole bean coffee for long periods of time or resell our whole bean coffee without our consent  which in each case  potentially affects the quality of the coffee prepared from our products 
if customers do not perceive our products and service to be of high quality  then the value of our brand may be diminished and  consequently  our ability to implement our business strategy may be adversely affected 
because our business is based primarily in california  a worsening of economic conditions  a decrease in consumer spending or a change in the competitive conditions in this market may substantially decrease our revenue and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy 
our california retail stores generated of our net revenue and a substantial portion of the revenue from our other distribution channels is generated in california 
we expect that our california operations will continue to generate a substantial portion of our revenue 
in addition  our california retail stores provide us with means for increasing brand awareness  building customer loyalty and creating a premium specialty coffee brand 
as a result  an economic downturn or other decrease in consumer spending in california may not only lead to a substantial decrease in revenue  but may also adversely impact our ability to market our brand  build customer loyalty  or otherwise implement our business strategy 
if we are unable to continue leasing our retail locations or obtain leases for new stores  our existing operations and our ability to expand may be adversely affected 
all of our retail locations are on leased premises 
if we are unable to renew these leases  our revenue and profits could suffer 
in addition  we intend to lease other premises in connection with the planned expansion of our retail operations 
because we compete with other retailers and restaurants for store sites and some landlords may grant exclusive locations to our competitors  we may not be able to obtain new leases or renew existing leases on acceptable terms 
this could adversely impact our revenue growth and brand building initiatives 
the direct store delivery system has significant start up costs and ongoing operating expenses and our profit margin could be adversely impacted if corresponding net revenue does not materialize 
we implemented a direct store delivery sales and distribution system during the fourth quarter of to support growth in the grocery area and to ensure store level execution is being managed to our standards 
this dsd system requires our route sales representatives to make weekly deliveries to stores in our own trucks  properly shelve the product  work to resolve pricing discrepancies  rotate to ensure freshness  sell and erect free standing displays  and forge store level selling relationships 
the deployment of the dsd system has substantial startup and continuing fixed costs which we expect to be offset by significant revenue increase over time 
if we are not able to increase the expected number of grocery accounts and or related net revenue to support the expenses we have incurred and will continue to incur  this could adversely impact our profit margin 
because we rely heavily on common carriers to ship our coffee on a daily basis  any disruption in their services or increase in shipping costs could adversely affect our business 
we rely on a number of common carriers to deliver coffee to our customers and retail stores 
we consider roasted coffee a perishable product and we rely on these common carriers to deliver fresh roasted coffee on a daily basis 
we have no control over these common carriers and the services provided by them may be interrupted as a result of labor shortages  contract disputes or other factors 
if we experience an interruption in these services  we may be unable to ship our coffee in a timely manner 
a delay in shipping could have an adverse impact on the quality of the coffee shipped  and thereby adversely affect our brand and reputation  result in the disposal of an amount of coffee that could not be shipped in a timely manner  and require us to contract with alternative  and possibly more expensive  common carriers 
any significant increase in shipping costs could lower our profit margins or force us to raise prices  which could cause our revenue and profits to suffer 
we depend on the expertise of key personnel 
if these individuals leave or change their role within our company without effective replacements  our operations may suffer 
the success of our business is dependent to a large degree on our management and our coffee roasters and purchasers 
if members of our management leave without effective replacements  our ability to implement our business strategy could be impaired 
if we lost the services of our coffee roasters and purchasers  our ability to source and purchase a sufficient supply of high quality coffee beans and roast coffee beans consistent with our quality standards could suffer 
in either case  our business and operations could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to hire or retain additional management and other personnel and our recruiting and training costs may increase as a result of turnover  both of which may increase our costs and reduce our profits and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy 
the success of our business depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly motivated  well qualified management and other personnel  including technical personnel and retail employees 
we face significant competition in the recruitment of qualified employees 
our ability to execute our business strategy may suffer if we are unable to recruit or retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  the costs of employee compensation or benefits increase substantially  or the costs of outsourcing certain tasks to third party providers increase substantially 
we expend significant resources in training our retail managers and employees 
during the past few years  retail employee turnover has increased to approximately per year 
if turnover continues to increase  we may incur additional recruiting and training costs 
because we have only one roasting facility  a significant interruption in the operation of this facility could potentially disrupt our operations 
we have only one coffee roasting and distribution facility 
a significant interruption in the operation of this facility  whether as a result of a natural disaster or other causes  could significantly impair our ability to operate our business on a day to day basis 
moreover  our roasting and distribution facility and most of our stores are located near several major earthquake faults 
the impact of a major earthquake on our facilities  infrastructure and overall operations is difficult to predict and an earthquake could seriously disrupt our entire business process 
our earthquake insurance covers net income  continuing normal operating expenses and extra expenses incurred during the period of restoration 
however  in the event of a catastrophic earthquake  our coverage is limited and we would incur additional expenses 
increases in the cost of high quality arabica coffee beans could reduce our gross margin and profit 
coffee is a trade commodity and  in general  its price can fluctuate depending on weather patterns in coffee producing countries  economic and political conditions affecting coffee producing countries  foreign currency fluctuations  and the ability of coffee producing countries to agree to export quotas 
coffee prices are currently near historical lows and we believe they are likely to increase in the future 
if the cost of our green coffee beans increases due to any of these or other factors  we may not be able to pass along those costs to our customers because of the competitive nature of the specialty coffee industry 
if we are unable to pass along increased coffee costs  our margins will decrease and our profitability will suffer accordingly 
in addition  our hedging policy may not be effective in controlling our coffee costs and the brokers with whom we have fixed price coffee purchase commitments may not deliver under those commitments 
in either case  our coffee costs may increase and our profitability may suffer 
decreased availability of high quality arabica coffee beans could result in a decrease in revenue and jeopardize our ability to expand our business 
arabica coffee beans of the quality we purchase are not readily available on the commodity markets 
we depend on our relationships with coffee brokers  exporters and growers for the supply of our primary raw material  high quality arabica coffee beans 
in both and  we purchased over half of our green coffee beans through one broker 
if our relationships with coffee brokers  exporters and growers deteriorate  we may be unable to procure a sufficient quantity of high quality coffee beans 
in such case  we may not be able to fulfill the demand of our existing customers  supply new retail stores or expand other channels of distribution 
a raw material shortage could result in decreased revenue or could impair our ability to expand our business 
political instability in coffee growing regions could result in a decrease in the availability of high quality arabica coffee beans needed for the continued operation and growth of our business and an increase in our operating costs 
we roast arabica coffee beans from many different regions to produce types and blends of coffee 
the political situation in many of those regions  including africa  indonesia and central and south america  can be unstable  and such instability could affect our ability to purchase coffee from those regions 
if arabica coffee beans from a region become unavailable or prohibitively expensive  we may be forced to discontinue particular coffee types and blends or substitute coffee beans from other regions in our blends 
frequent substitutions and changes in our coffee product lines may lead to cost increases  customer alienation and fluctuations in our gross margins 
furthermore  a worldwide supply shortage of the high quality arabica coffee beans we purchase could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our roasting methods are not proprietary  so competitors may be able to duplicate them  which could harm our competitive position 
we consider our roasting methods essential to the flavor and richness of our roasted whole bean coffee and  therefore  essential to our brand 
because we do not hold any patents for our roasting methods  it may be difficult for us to prevent competitors from copying our roasting methods 
if our competitors copy our roasting methods  the value of our brand may be diminished  and we may lose customers to our competitors 
in addition  competitors may be able to develop roasting methods that are more advanced than our roasting methods  which may also harm our competitive position 
competition in the specialty coffee market is intense and could affect our profitability 
the specialty coffee market is highly fragmented 
our primary competitors in whole bean specialty coffee sales include gevalia kraft foods  green mountain coffee  illy caffe  millstone procter gamble  seattle s best afc enterprises and starbucks 
there are numerous smaller  regional brands that also compete in this category 
in addition  we compete indirectly against all other coffee brands on the market 
a number of nationwide coffee marketers  such as kraft foods  procter gamble and nestle  are distributing premium coffee brands in supermarkets 
these premium coffee brands may serve as substitutes for our whole bean coffee 
in addition to competing with other distributors of whole bean coffee  we compete with retailers of prepared beverages  including coffee house chains  particularly starbucks  numerous convenience stores  restaurants  coffee shops and street vendors 
if we do not succeed in effectively differentiating ourselves from our competitors or our competitors adopt our strategies  then our competitive position will be weakened 
despite competing in a fragmented product category  whole bean specialty coffee brands are being established across multiple distribution channels 
several competitors are aggressive in obtaining distribution in specialty grocery and gourmet food stores  through online and mail order and in office  restaurant and food service locations 
we have only recently begun to penetrate these channels 
other competitors may have an advantage over us based on their earlier entry into these distribution channels 
competition in the specialty coffee market is becoming increasingly intense as relatively low barriers to entry encourage new competitors to enter the specialty coffee market 
many of these new market entrants may have substantially greater financial  marketing and operating resources than us 
in addition  many of our existing competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing and operating resources than us 
adverse public or medical opinion about caffeine may harm our business 
our specialty coffee contains significant amounts of caffeine and other active compounds  the health effects of some of which are not fully understood 
a number of research studies conclude or suggest that excessive consumption of caffeine may lead to increased heart rate  nausea and vomiting  restlessness and anxiety  depression  headaches  tremors  sleeplessness and other adverse health effects 
an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in coffee could significantly reduce the demand for coffee  which could harm our business and reduce our sales and profits 
adverse publicity regarding customer complaints may harm our business 
we may be the subject of complaints or litigation from customers alleging beverage and food related illnesses  injuries suffered on the premises or other quality  health or operational concerns 
adverse publicity resulting from such allegations may materially adversely affect us  regardless of whether such allegations are true or whether we are ultimately held liable
