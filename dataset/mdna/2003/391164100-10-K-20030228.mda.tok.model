the great plains energy trading symbol gxp replaced the kcp l trading symbol klt on the new york stock exchange 
during  the company s management revised its corporate business strategy 
the goal is to become a premier diversified energy company that achieves annual growth in earnings per share in a financially disciplined manner 
to achieve this goal  great plains energy intends to focus on its three reportable segments of business o stressing operational excellence in the utility operations of kcp l  o expanding strategic energy s business model into new markets  and o developing klt gas into a leading unconventional natural gas exploration company 
critical accounting policies pensions kcp l incurs significant costs in providing non contributory defined pension benefits 
the costs are developed from actuarial valuations that are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future plan experience 
pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age  compensation levels and employment periods  the level of contributions made to the plan  earnings on plan assets and plan amendments 
in addition  pension costs are also affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement 
kcp l generally recognizes gains and losses by amortizing over a five year period the rolling five year average of unamortized gains and losses 
the key assumptions used in developing our pension disclosures were a discount rate  a expected return on plan assets and a compensation rate increase 
these are consistent with the prior years assumptions except that the discount rate was and in and  respectively 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a percent increase or decrease in certain actuarial assumptions 
each sensitivity reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption 
impact on impact on projected impact on change in benefit pension pension actuarial assumption assumption obligation liability expense millions discount rate increase rate of return on plan assets increase discount rate decrease rate of return on plan assets decrease in selecting an assumed discount rate  fixed income security yield rates for year treasury bonds and corporate high grade bond yields are considered 
the assumed rate of return on plan assets is the weighted average of long term returns forecast for the type of investments held by the plan 
in  kcp l recorded non cash expense of approximately million  a million increase from the previous year 
pension expense for is expected to be approximately million  an increase of million over the increase is due primarily to lower returns on plan assets 
kcp l s pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
the market value of the plan assets has been affected by the sharp declines in equity markets since the third quarter of during  plan assets declined in value by approximately million 
during  the plan continued to experience losses as plan assets declined an additional million in market value 
at december   the fair value of pension plan assets was million 
as a result of the decline in the equity markets and lower discount rates in  the total accumulated benefit obligation abo of the plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets at december  as prescribed by sfas no 
 kcp l has recorded a minimum pension liability of million 
this was offset by an intangible asset of million  the balance of unamortized prior service costs  with the remaining million charged to common equity through other comprehensive income oci 
the impact on oci  net of deferred tax  was million 
however  there was no impact on net income 
the impact on oci could reverse in future periods to the extent the fair value of trust assets exceeds the abo 
absent a substantial recovery in the equity markets  pension costs  cash funding requirements and the additional pension liability could substantially increase in future years 
regulatory matters as a regulated utility  kcp l is subject to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
accordingly  kcp l has recorded assets and liabilities on its balance sheet resulting from the effects of the ratemaking process  which would not be recorded under generally accepted accounting principles gaap if kcp l was not regulated 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
regulatory liabilities generally represent probable future reductions in revenue or refunds to customers 
at december   kcp l s regulatory assets and liabilities totaled million and million  respectively 
kcp l s continued ability to meet the criteria for application of sfas no 
may be affected in the future by competitive forces and restructuring in the electric industry 
in the event that sfas no 
no longer applied to all  or a separable portion of kcp l s operations  the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless an appropriate regulatory recovery mechanism is provided 
additionally  these factors could result in an impairment of utility plant assets as determined pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of regulatory assets and liabilities 
at the end of january  a severe ice storm occurred throughout large portions of the midwest  including the greater kansas city metropolitan area 
in the second quarter of  the kcc approved the stipulation and agreement that kcp l had reached with the commission staff and the citizens utility ratepayers board with regard to treatment of the kansas portion of the ice storm costs 
under this stipulation and agreement  kcp l received a rate moratorium until in exchange for kcp l s agreement to not seek recovery of the million expense for the kansas jurisdictional portion of the storm costs and reduce rates by million in additionally  kcp l agreed to determine depreciation expense of wolf creek using a year life instead of a year life effective january  which results in a reduction of expense by approximately million in kcp l also agreed to file a rate case by may  in december  the kcc approved tariffs implementing the stipulation and agreement  which resulted in a reduction of million in annual kansas retail revenues  effective january  effective august  the mpsc approved kcp l s application for an accounting authority order related to the missouri jurisdictional portion of the storm costs 
the order allows kcp l to defer and amortize million  representing the missouri impact of the storm  through january the amortization began in september and totaled million in kcp l will amortize approximately million annually for the remainder of the amortization period 
in october  the staff of the mpsc concluded its review of the missouri jurisdictional earnings for kcp l and determined that the current rate levels did not warrant action 
asset impairment  including goodwill and other intangible assets long lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable as prescribed under sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from an asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of impairment recognized is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the asset from the carrying value of the asset 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on great plains energy and consolidated kcp l 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently when indicators of impairment exist as prescribed under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill  the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill must be compared with its carrying value to determine the amount of impairment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the impact of adopting sfas no 
on goodwill and goodwill amortization 
goodwill of million was recorded in conjunction with klt energy services indirect ownership acquisitions of strategic energy from through at december   the unamortized balance of goodwill associated with strategic energy was million 
during  additional goodwill of million was recorded at iec related to its indirect ownership acquisition of strategic energy 
strategic energy s transition and annual impairment tests have been completed and there was no impairment of the strategic energy goodwill 
at december   the unamortized balance of strategic energy goodwill on great plains energy s balance sheet was million 
goodwill has been recorded by rs andrews enterprises  inc rsae at various times as it purchased property and businesses 
at december   the unamortized balance of rsae goodwill was million 
rsae s goodwill was reviewed for impairment as of january   as required under the implementation provisions of sfas no 
based upon the results of a third party study and budgeted revenue  rsae recorded a million impairment of goodwill 
the impairment is reflected as a cumulative effect to january   of a change in accounting principle 
during september  the company conducted its first annual impairment test on rsae s goodwill based on a discounted cash flow model 
the model assumed a discount rate of and sales growth of for five years with revenues stable thereafter 
the model indicated no additional impairment had occurred 
management believes that the accounting estimates related to impairment analyses required under sfas no 
and sfas no 
are critical accounting estimates 
the estimates are highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about future sales  operating costs and discount rates over an indefinite life 
historically  actual margins and volumes have fluctuated and  to a great extent  fluctuations are expected to continue 
the estimates of future margins are based upon internal budgets  which incorporate estimates of customer growth  business expansion and weather trends  among other items

in mid to more than offset increased expenses 
the increased expenses included the january ice storm costs and increased administrative and general expenses primarily from increased pension expenses 
strategic energy s earnings increased million  excluding earnings during of million from the sale of power purchased from one supplier under wholesale contracts that expired at the end of the increase is due to continued growth in retail electric sales resulting from increases in customer accounts and mwh s served 
this was partially offset by increased salaries and benefits and an increase in income taxes as a result of increased sales in states with higher income tax rates for the current year 
during  klt gas focused on the acquisition of additional leased acreage and the testing and development of several unconventional natural gas properties 
klt gas earnings in reflect the million after tax gain on the sale of its equity ownership in patrick klt gas  llc 
other non regulated operations included  among other things  a million increase in earnings primarily due to lower reductions in affordable housing limited partnerships in compared to additionally  reflects million related to both dti operating losses incurred in and the million net write off following dti s bankruptcy filings at the end of as a result of dti s filing for bankruptcy protection  dti is not included in results of operations 
the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles reflects rsae s write down of goodwill due to the adoption of sfas no

kcp l s increase in earnings was primarily the result of the significant net positive impacts of the return to service of hawthorn no 
in mid a significant reduction in purchased power expense  especially in the summer months  combined with reduced fuel cost per mwh generated more than offset increased fuel costs primarily due to an increase in mwh s generated and increased operating expenses including depreciation and interest charges 
kcp l recorded million of income taxes in for a proposed internal revenue service irs adjustment related to corporate owned life insurance coli 
additionally  subsidiary operations in included a million write down of the investment in rsae 
strategic energy s earnings increased million primarily due to growth in retail electric sales and higher earnings during than in on wholesale sales of the power supplied under wholesale contracts  particularly during the summer months of klt gas earnings decreased million primarily due to the sale in late of producing natural gas properties for an after tax gain of million 
the gain and the loss of gas production revenue were partially offset by the million after tax gain on klt gas sale of its equity ownership in patrick klt gas  llc 
other non regulated operations included million related to both dti operating losses in and the million net write off following dti s bankruptcy filing at the end of partially offset by million of equity losses in dti in also included was a million decrease primarily attributable to recording more reductions in affordable housing limited partnerships in than in  prior to klt telecom s purchase of majority ownership in dti  dti completed a tender offer for of its outstanding senior discount notes 
this transaction resulted in a million extraordinary gain on the early extinguishment of debt 
the cumulative effect to january   reflects kcp l s change in methods of amortizing unrecognized net gains and losses and determination of expected return related to its accounting for pension expense 
for further discussion regarding each segment s results of operations  see its respective section below 
consolidated kcp l the following discussion of consolidated kcp l results of operations includes kcp l  an integrated electric utility and hss  an unregulated subsidiary of kcp l 
references to kcp l  in the discussion that follows  reflect only the operations of the integrated electric utility 
the discussion excludes the results of operations for gpp and klt inc and subsidiaries  which were transferred to great plains energy on october  consolidated kcp l business overview as an integrated electric utility  kcp l engages in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity 
kcp l s power business will have over  megawatts of generating capacity following the completion of five combustion turbine units that will add megawatts of peaking capacity 
during  kcp l entered into a million  five year construction and synthetic operating lease transaction for the five combustion turbines 
during  the lease was amended to reduce the amount financed from the previously estimated million to million to reflect changes in the estimated cost for the purchase  installation  assembly and construction of the five combustion turbines 
construction began during the third quarter of with the expected commercial operation of the five combustion turbines in the spring and summer kcp l s delivery business consists of transmission and distribution facilities that serve almost  customers as of december  kcp l continues to experience load growth approximating the historical average of to annually through increased customer usage and additional customers 
rates charged for electricity are below the national average 
at the end of january  a severe ice storm occurred throughout large portions of the midwest  including the greater kansas city metropolitan area 
at its peak  the storm caused over  customer outages throughout the kcp l service territory  an unprecedented level in the kcp l s year history 
crews from other utilities in numerous states were called in to assist in the restoration of power and power was restored in nine days 
costs related to the january ice storm were approximately million of which million were capital expenditures and therefore charged to utility plant 
kcp l expensed million for the kansas jurisdictional portion of the storm costs and deferred million of the storm costs applicable to missouri 
in january  edison electric institute honored kcp l for exemplary performance and dedication in restoring power to customers during the storm and recognized kcp l by awarding it the association s annual emergency response award 
under the ferc order  kcp l  as an investor owned utility  is strongly encouraged to join a ferc approved rto 
rtos combine regional transmission operations of utility businesses into a regional organization that schedules transmission services and monitors the energy market to ensure regional transmission reliability and non discriminatory access 
during the first quarter of  the spp and the miso voted to consolidate the two organizations to create a larger midwestern rto  a non profit organization that will operate in twenty states and one canadian province 
kcp l is a member of the spp 
the consolidation is expected to be completed during the second quarter of and has received ferc approval 
the ferc has already approved an rto proposal submitted by the miso 
additionally  regulatory approvals would have to be received from the mpsc and the kcc prior to kcp l s participation in an rto 
during  kcp l expects to make filings with the mpsc and kcc seeking permission to participate in the rto resulting from the merger of spp and miso 
during february  kcp l submitted to miso a conditional application to joining the rto resulting from the merger of spp and miso 
during the third quarter of  the ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to remedy undue discrimination through open access transmission service and standard electricity market design 
the proposed rulemaking is designed to establish a single non discriminatory open access transmission tariff with a single transmission service that is applicable to all users of the interstate transmission grid 
all public utilities that own  control or operate interstate transmission facilities would be required to become independent transmission providers  turn over the operation of their transmission facilities to an rto that meets the definition of an independent transmission provider or contract with an entity that meets the definition of an independent transmission provider 
kcp l filed comments with the ferc on the proposed rulemaking in november the ferc has recently announced that it will issue a white paper on standard electricity market design in april and accept comments on that paper before issuing a final rule  which is now expected in the third or fourth quarter of kcp l s participation in the rto resulting from the merger of spp and miso would fulfill the majority of the requirements of this proposed rulemaking 
kcp l has a wholly owned unregulated subsidiary  hss  that holds investments in businesses primarily in residential services 
hss is comprised of two direct subsidiaries  rsae and worry free 
hss is evaluating strategic alternatives concerning its investments  which could include a possible sale of a portion or all of the business 
in  hss increased its ownership in rsae  a consumer services company headquartered in atlanta  georgia  from to 
accordingly  hss changed its method of accounting for rsae from the equity method to consolidation 
during  hss recorded losses from its investment in rsae that resulted in a negative investment balance 
as a result of these losses  the minority interest in rsae was reduced to zero 
accordingly  as long as rsae is consolidated  any future losses of rsae would be recorded by hss at  which will further decrease the investment below zero 
consolidated kcp l results of operations the following table summarizes consolidated kcp l s comparative results of operations

the reduction in industrial revenues was primarily due to a weakened economy and the loss of million in revenues from one of kcp l s major industrial customers 
load growth consists of higher usage per customer and the addition of new customers 
the average number of both residential and commercial customers increased approximately in as compared to less than of revenues include an automatic fuel adjustment provision 
excluding the impact of the loss of million in revenues from one of kcp l s major industrial customers  retail revenues and mwh sales remained relatively consistent in compared to extremely mild weather during the second half of mostly offset the colder winter and warmer spring and early summer weather experienced in the first half of and continued load growth 
the average number of both residential and commercial customers increased approximately in as compared to the major industrial customer declared bankruptcy on february   and closed its kansas city  missouri facilities on may  kcp l has continued to be able to mitigate the effect of the loss with other sales

wholesale mwh sales increased in compared to and in compared to due to increased bulk power mwh s sold 
additionally  wholesale sales revenue increased million in compared to and million in compared to due to additional capacity sales beginning in the last half of kcp l fuel and purchased power the fuel cost per mwh generated and the purchased power cost per mwh have a significant impact on the results of operations for kcp l 
generation fuel mix can change the fuel cost per mwh generated substantially 
nuclear fuel costs per mwh generated remain substantially less than the cost of coal per mwh generated 
replacement power costs for planned wolf creek outages are accrued evenly over the unit s operating cycle 
kcp l expects its cost of nuclear fuel to remain fairly constant through the year coal has a significantly lower cost per mwh generated than natural gas and oil 
kcp l s procurement strategies continue to provide delivered coal costs below the regional average 
the cost per mwh for purchased power is still significantly higher than the fuel cost per mwh of coal and nuclear generation 
kcp l continually evaluates its system requirements  the availability of generating units  availability and cost of fuel supply  availability and cost of purchased power and the requirements of other electric systems to provide reliable power economically 
fossil plants averaged of total generation and the nuclear plant the remainder over the last three years 
fuel costs decreased million in compared to  despite a increase in generation 
lower fuel cost per mwh generated due to additional coal and less natural gas and oil in the generation fuel mix was the primary reason for the decline in fuel costs 
the return to service of hawthorn no 
 a low cost coal fired unit  in mid contributed to the change in generation fuel mix 
significantly lower natural gas prices and a reduction in the cost of uranium during also contributed to the lower fuel cost 
fuel costs increased million in compared to primarily due to a increase in mwh s generated partially offset by a reduction in the fuel cost per mwh generated 
the increase in mwh s generated was primarily due to hawthorn no 
 a coal fired unit  returning to operation in mid and the impact of the scheduled outage at wolf creek  a nuclear unit 
the additional availability of these two low fuel cost units in changed the generation fuel mix and lowered the cost per mwh generated 
purchased power expenses decreased million in compared to cost per mwh purchased decreased approximately in compared to due to regional energy availability  a less volatile energy market and decreased mwh purchases during peak hours 
also contributing to the decrease was a decrease in mwh s purchased due to the increased availability of kcp l generating units 
purchased power expenses decreased million in compared to primarily due to a decrease in mwh s purchased in compared to the decrease in mwh s purchased was primarily due to the increased availability of kcp l s generating units during compared to increased availability also allowed kcp l to reduce its cost of purchased capacity by million in as compared to in addition  the cost per mwh was down in compared to consolidated kcp l other operating expenses including operating  maintenance and general taxes kcp l s other operating expenses increased million in compared to primarily due to the following o expensing the million kansas jurisdictional portion of the january ice storm and amortizing million of the missouri jurisdictional portion of the ice storm o increased administrative and general expenses o million increased pension expense due to a significant decline in the market value of plan assets o million increased injuries and damages expenses resulting from additional claims and the settlement of outstanding claims o million increased general taxes primarily due to increases in property tax levy rates hss other expenses decreased million in compared to due to the closure of some rsae locations and the implementation of cost saving strategies at rsae 
kcp l s other operating expenses decreased million in compared to primarily due to the following o million decreased operating expenses for replacement power insurance because of the availability of hawthorn no

unit in late and hawthorn nos 
 and units were placed in service in mid consolidated kcp l interest charges consolidated kcp l s interest charges increased million in compared to and million in compared to primarily because of increased interest expense on long term debt and decreased allowance for borrowed funds used to finance construction  partially offset by a decreased interest expense on short term debt 
a portion of the proceeds from long term debt issuances has been used to pay down short term debt 
long term debt interest expense kcp l s long term debt interest expense increased million in compared to  primarily due to higher average levels of long term debt outstanding 
lower average rates on variable rate long term debt partially offset the higher average levels of long term debt 
the higher average levels of debt outstanding primarily reflect the issuances of long term debt in and the issuance of million of unsecured  fixed rate senior notes partially offset by million of scheduled debt repayments during kcp l s long term debt interest expense increased million in compared to reflecting higher average levels of long term debt outstanding  partially offset by the impact of decreases in variable interest rates 
the higher average levels of debt primarily reflect the issuances of long term debt in and million of unsecured  fixed rate senior notes issued in november  partially offset by million of scheduled debt repayments 
short term debt interest expense kcp l s short term debt interest expense decreased million in compared to average interest rates were down more than and average levels of outstanding commercial paper were down more than in compared to kcp l had no commercial paper outstanding at december  kcp l s short term debt interest expense decreased million in compared to primarily due to lower average interest rates on commercial paper  partially offset by higher average levels of outstanding commercial paper during compared to kcp l had million and million of commercial paper outstanding at december  and  respectively 
capitalized interest allowance for borrowed funds used to finance construction decreased million in compared to and million in compared to because of decreased construction work in progress primarily due to the return to service of hawthorn no 
in mid wolf creek wolf creek  a nuclear unit  represents about of kcp l s generating capacity 
this percentage will decline slightly with kcp l s expected addition of five leased combustion turbines 
wolf creek s operating performance has remained strong over the last three years  contributing an average of of kcp l s annual mwh generation while operating at an average capacity of 
wolf creek has the lowest fuel cost per mwh generated of any of kcp l s generating units 
kcp l accrues the incremental operating  maintenance and replacement power costs for planned outages evenly over the unit s operating cycle  normally months 
as actual outage expenses are incurred  the refueling liability and related deferred tax asset are reduced 
wolf creek returned to service on april   following a day refueling and maintenance outage that began on march  during the outage  a complete inspection of the reactor vessel head indicated no corrosion or other problems of the type experienced at the davis besse nuclear plant in ohio 
the next outage is scheduled for the fall of and is estimated to be a day outage 
wolf creek s assets represent about of kcp l s assets and its operating expenses represent about of kcp l s operating expenses 
an extended shut down of wolf creek could have a substantial adverse effect on kcp l s business  financial condition and results of operations because of higher replacement power and other costs 
although not expected  the nrc could impose an unscheduled plant shut down  reacting to safety concerns at the plant or other similar nuclear units 
if a long term shut down occurred  the state regulatory commissions could reduce rates by excluding the wolf creek investment from rate base 
there has been significant opposition and delays to  development of a low level radioactive waste disposal facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
an inability to complete this project would require kcp l to write off its net investment in the project  which was million at december  kcp l  and the other owners of wolf creek  could also still be required to participate in development of an alternate site 
ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit exposes kcp l to risks regarding decommissioning costs at the end of the unit s life and to potential retrospective assessments and property losses in excess of insurance coverage 
these risks are more fully discussed in the related sections of notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
montrose no 
montrose no 
 a mw unit  returned to service at the end of the third quarter following a forced outage due to damage to the turbine blades in the combined high and intermediate pressure section of the turbine 
additional maintenance  including replacing blades in the low pressure section of the turbine to mitigate a long outage in the next few years and maintenance originally scheduled for october  was also completed during the three month outage 
the unanticipated outage costs were approximately million of capital expenditures  million in additional operations and maintenance expense and million in net fuel and purchased power expense in these amounts do not reflect the million expected to be recovered from insurance in hawthorn no

the coal fired unit has a capacity of megawatts and was rebuilt following a february explosion that destroyed the boiler 
hawthorn no 
has been nationally recognized in the national energy policy report for its use of best available pollution control technology 
under kcp l s property insurance coverage  kcp l received an additional million in insurance recoveries in  increasing the total insurance recoveries received to date to million 
the recoveries have been recorded as an increase in accumulated depreciation on the consolidated balance sheet

in  klt energy services exchanged its ownership of million of preferred stock in another energy service company for additional ownership in strategic energy 
this transaction increased klt energy services indirect ownership in strategic energy from to 
during the fourth quarter of  iec acquired a indirect ownership position in strategic energy in exchange for million in common stock and notes issued by great plains energy and iec 
as of december   great plains energy s indirect ownership in strategic energy totals 
in  strategic energy also provided retail gas services to commercial  institutional and small manufacturing customers 
strategic energy elected to exit this business in the first quarter of to focus on power supply coordination services and had phased out of retail gas services at the end of strategic energy made this decision after evaluating the organizational demands  growth prospects and relative levels of profitability of both businesses 
as the marketplace and strategic energy s business evolves  strategic energy may elect to re enter the market for retail gas services 
at december   strategic energy provided power supply coordination services on behalf of approximately  commercial  institutional and small manufacturing accounts 
strategic energy s customer base is very diverse 
strategic energy served over  customers  including numerous fortune companies  smaller companies  and governmental entities 
based solely on current signed contracts and expected usage  strategic energy anticipates future mwh sales of million  million  million  and million for the years through  respectively 
strategic energy expects to also supply additional mwh sales in these years through growth in existing markets by re signing existing customers and signing new customers as well as through expansion into new markets 
strategic energy enters into forward contracts with multiple suppliers 
at december   strategic energy s five largest suppliers under forward supply contracts represented of the total future committed purchases 
in the event of supplier non delivery or default  strategic energy s results of operations could be affected to the extent that the cost of replacement power exceeded the combination of the contracted price with the supplier and the amount of collateral held by strategic energy to mitigate its market risk with the supplier 
strategic energy s results of operations could also be affected  in a given period  if it was required to make a payment upon termination of a supplier contract to the extent that the contracted price with the supplier exceeded the market value of the contract 
strategic energy monitors its counterparty credit risk by evaluating the credit quality and performance of its suppliers on a routine basis and by  among other things  adjusting the amount of collateral required from its suppliers  as part of its risk management policy and practices 
strategic energy maintains a commodity price risk management strategy that uses forward physical energy purchases and derivative instruments to minimize significant  unanticipated earnings fluctuations caused by commodity price volatility 
as a result of supplying electricity to retail customers under fixed rate contracts  strategic energy s policy is to match customers demand with fixed price purchases 
in certain markets where strategic energy operates  entering into forward fixed price contracts is cost prohibitive 
by entering into swap contracts for a portion of its forecasted purchases in these markets  the future purchase price of electricity is effectively fixed under these swap contracts 
the swap contracts limit the unfavorable effect that price increases will have on electricity purchases 
under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  all of the swap agreements are currently designated as cash flow hedges resulting in the difference between the market value of energy and the hedge value being recorded as comprehensive income loss 
at december  and  the accumulated comprehensive gain loss  net of income taxes and minority interest  reflected in great plains energy s consolidated statements of capitalization included a million gain and million loss  respectively  related to such cash flow hedges 
however  substantially all of the energy hedged with the swaps has been sold to customers through contracts at prices different than the fair market value used to value the swaps 
therefore  strategic energy does not anticipate realizing the gain loss represented in comprehensive income 
during the third quarter of  the ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to remedy undue discrimination through open access transmission service and standard electricity market design 
the proposed rulemaking is designed to establish a single non discriminatory open access transmission tariff with a single transmission service that is applicable to all users of the interstate transmission grid 
strategic energy has evaluated the impact of the proposed rulemaking on its operations and provided comments to the ferc that are generally supportive of the provisions of the proposal  but suggested some changes to the proposed rule 
the ferc has recently announced that it will issue a white paper on standard electricity market design in april and accept comments on that paper before issuing a final rule  which is now expected in the third or fourth quarter of strategic energy results of operations the following table summarizes strategic energy s comparative results of operations 
millions operating revenues purchased power revenues  net of purchased power other operating expenses depreciation operating income non operating income expenses interest charges income taxes net income strategic energy s net income increased million in compared to  excluding earnings during of million from the sale of power purchased from one supplier under wholesale contracts that expired at the end of the increased net income in compared to is primarily due to continued growth in retail electric sales from the expansion into new markets and continued sales efforts in existing markets  partially offset by increased labor and benefits as well as other general and administrative expenses and income taxes due to increased sales in states with higher income tax rates 
strategic energy s net income increased million in compared to  primarily due to growth in retail electric sales and higher earnings during than in on wholesale sales of the power supplied under the wholesale contracts discussed above 
strategic energy operating revenues operating revenues from strategic energy increased million in compared to and million in compared to the following table reflects strategic energy s operating revenues 
change change millions electric retail electric wholesale gas and other total operating revenues at december   strategic energy served over  customers  an increase from approximately  customers and  customers at the end of and  respectively 
these customers represented approximately  accounts at the end of  compared to about  accounts and  accounts at the end of and  respectively 
strategic energy may provide periodic billing credits to its customers resulting from its power supply coordination efforts 
the amounts credited back to the customer are treated as a reduction of retail electric revenues when determined to be payable 
retail electric revenues increased million in compared to primarily due to increased retail mwh sales  partially offset by an decrease in average retail revenues per mwh 
retail mwh s sold increased to million in from million in  primarily from continued growth in existing markets and expansion into new markets during growth in existing markets came primarily from strong sales efforts in re signing existing customers as well as signing new customers 
expansion into new markets contributed million in mwh sales and approximately million of retail electric revenues during several factors contribute to changes in the average retail revenues per mwh  including the underlying price of the commodity  the nature and type of products offered and the mix of sales by geographic market 
retail electric revenues increased million in compared to primarily due to an increase in retail mwh sales and an increase in average retail revenues per mwh 
retail mwh s sold increased from million in  primarily from growth in existing markets and expansion into new markets during the increase in average retail revenues per mwh in compared to is due to higher bundled product sales in and expansion into new markets  which had higher average commodity prices than the average for strategic energy s existing markets 
wholesale electric revenues decreased million in compared to and increased million in compared to primarily due to the sale of power during purchased from one supplier under wholesale contracts that expired at the end of during the third quarter of  strategic energy began to phase out its natural gas retail supply service  which was completely phased out during the fourth quarter of this is the primary reason for the decrease in gas and other sales revenues in compared to strategic energy purchased power to supply its retail contracts  strategic energy purchases long term blocks of electricity under forward contracts in fixed quantities at fixed prices from power suppliers based on projected usage 
strategic energy sells any excess retail supply of electricity back into the wholesale market 
the proceeds from the sale of excess supply of electricity is recorded as a reduction of purchased power 
the gross amount of excess retail supply sales that reduced purchased power was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
as previously discussed  strategic energy operates in several retail choice electricity markets 
the cost of supplying electricity to retail customers can vary widely by geographic market 
this variability can be affected by many factors including  among other items  geographic differences in the cost per mwh of purchased power and capacity charges due to regional purchased power availability and requirements of other electricity providers and differences in transmission charges 
however  strategic energy has mitigated the effects of higher supply costs by entering into long term  full requirements contracts with customers that are priced to the customers based on the cost of the associated supply contract 
purchased power increased million in compared to and million in compared to primarily due to the increases in electric mwh sales discussed above 
additionally  purchased power expense as a percentage of electric revenues increased in compared to primarily due to purchases of power from one supplier during under wholesale contracts that expired at the end of purchased power expense as a percentage of electric revenues also increased in compared to the increase in purchased power as a percentage of electric revenues was due to a significant increase in the percentage of strategic energy s total mwh sales derived from retail mwh sales compared to strategic energy s wholesale electric mwh sales in both and had a higher gross margin revenues less cost of energy supplied than its retail electric mwh sales 
strategic energy other operating expenses strategic energy s other operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenues decreased to in from and in and  respectively  due to strategic energy s efforts in leveraging its infrastructure and the effects of achieving economies of scale 
strategic energy continued to experience increased labor and benefits as well as other general and administrative expenses during  following the growth in retail electric sales  expansion into new markets and increased fuel management and consulting activities 
other operating expenses in include the cost of commercial gas sales of about million  from strategic energy s natural gas retail supply service  which was phased out by the end of as a result  other operating expenses excluding the cost of commercial gas sales increased million in compared to contributing to this increase were higher labor and benefit costs from the addition of employees and increasing health care related costs  higher profit sharing and deferred compensation expense which are tied to earnings and financial performance  and higher other general and administrative expenses associated with higher sales volumes  geographic market expansion  and regulatory and market development initiatives 
operating expenses increased million in compared to primarily due to increased labor and benefits costs from the addition of employees during as well as increased other general and administrative expenses during  following the pattern of growth in sales and expansion of activities discussed above 
strategic energy non operating income expenses non operating income expenses includes non operating income less minority interest expense and non operating expenses 
in compared to  non operating income expenses increased million primarily due to a gain of million recognized on the sale of gas contracts during the second quarter of and an increase in minority interest expense of million  which represents the share of strategic energy s net income not attributable to great plains energy s indirect ownership interest in strategic energy 
in compared to  non operating income expenses increased million primarily due to an increase in minority interest expense of million  offset by the gain of million recognized on the sale of gas contracts during the second quarter of klt gas klt gas business overview klt gas is focused on exploring for  developing and producing unconventional natural gas resources  including coalbed methane properties 
klt gas believes that unconventional natural gas resources provide an economically attractive alternative source of supply to meet the growing demand for natural gas in north america 
additionally  klt gas management team has experience and expertise in identifying  testing and producing unconventional natural gas properties and  as a result  it believes its expertise provides a competitive advantage in this niche of the exploration and production sector 
because it has a longer  predictable reserve life and lower development cost  management believes unconventional natural gas exploration is inherently lower risk than conventional gas exploration 
although gas prices have been volatile historically  klt gas continues to believe that the long term future price scenarios for natural gas appear strong 
environmental concerns  especially air quality  and the increased demand for natural gas for new electric generating capacity are contributing to this projected growth in demand 
klt gas properties are located in colorado  texas  wyoming  kansas  and nebraska 
these leased properties cover approximately  undeveloped acres 
the testing of this acreage is in accordance with klt gas exploration plan and capital budget 
klt gas estimates capital expenditures of approximately million to million annually for the years through the timing of the testing may vary from current plans based upon obtaining the required environmental and regulatory approvals and permits and future changes in market conditions 
klt gas continues to seek and identify new prospects in addition to its existing portfolio of properties 
in  klt gas focused on the acquisition of additional leased acreage and the testing and development of several unconventional natural gas exploration projects 
klt gas is in the early stages of testing a new prospect in colorado and continuing pilot development at a powder river basin project and two additional projects in the rocky mountain region 
klt gas continued production at its south texas property 
klt gas results of operations the following table summarizes klt gas comparative results of operations 
millions operating revenues other operating expenses depreciation and depletion gain on property operating income loss income from equity investments non operating income expenses interest charges income taxes net income klt gas is currently testing gas properties following its most recent sale of property during the second quarter of klt gas net income included its second quarter patrick klt gas  llc sale which resulted in a million after tax gain 
klt gas net income included its third and fourth quarter sales of producing natural gas properties  resulting in a million after tax gain 
klt gas operating revenues operating revenues increased million in compared to primarily due to the effect of gas hedging activities during  partially offset by declining production at klt gas south texas property during operating revenues decreased million in compared to primarily due to the sale of producing natural gas properties in the third and fourth quarters of and the effect of gas hedging activities 
klt gas unwound the majority of its gas hedge derivatives with an offsetting swap transaction during the second quarter of the fair market value of the swap was recorded in gas revenues 
klt gas income taxes klt gas recorded tax credits related to its investment in natural gas properties of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the law that allowed substantially all of these credits expired at the end of other non regulated activities investment in affordable housing limited partnerships klt investments klt investments inc s klt investments earnings in totaled million including an after tax reduction of million in its affordable housing investment compared to earnings of million in including an after tax reduction of million in its affordable housing investment and earnings of million in including an after tax reduction of million in its affordable housing investment 
pretax reductions in affordable housing investments were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
pretax reductions in its affordable housing investments are estimated to be million  million  million  and million for the years through  respectively 
the reductions in  and and estimated future reductions are based on comparisons of the cost for those properties accounted for by the cost method to the total projected residual value of the properties and remaining tax credits to be received 
these projections are based on the latest information available but the ultimate amount and timing of actual reductions could be significantly different from the above estimates 
the properties underlying the partnership investment are subject to certain risks inherent in real estate ownership and management 
even after the estimated reductions  earnings from the investments in affordable housing are expected to be positive for the next four years 
klt investments accrued tax credits related to its investments in affordable housing limited partnerships of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
subsidiary of klt telecom files for bankruptcy dti the accounting treatment related to dti and its bankruptcy is complex and is addressed in greater detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  consequently  note in its entirety is incorporated by reference in this portion of management s discussion and analysis and should be read as a component of this discussion 
in  klt telecom originally purchased  for million  a equity ownership of dti  a facilities based telecommunications company headquartered in st 
louis 
dti s operating losses reduced this original equity investment to zero by june in february  klt telecom increased its ownership to by purchasing additional shares at a cost of approximately million  and in conjunction with such purchase made a million loan to holdings 
also in february  klt telecom made a commitment to obtain or arrange a million revolving credit facility for digital teleport inc klt telecom loaned digital teleport inc 
million during under this and other arrangements 
dti intended to refinance part of these loans 
however  a new senior credit facility from bank lenders was not obtained due to  among other things  the downturn in the telecommunications industry 
starting in the second quarter of  dti conserved cash by more narrowly focusing its strategy to providing connectivity in secondary and tertiary markets in a five state region 
dti actively explored its strategic alternatives including a merger  sale of assets and all other types of recapitalization including bankruptcy 
dti originally thought that the industry downturn would be only temporary 
however  during the fourth quarter the combination of a lack of additional financing  continued decline of the telecommunication industry  and the cash requirements of maintaining its long haul assets resulted in dti making the decision to abandon certain of its long haul assets and file for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
on december   a subsidiary of klt telecom  holdings and its subsidiaries  digital teleport and digital teleport of virginia  inc  filed separate voluntary petitions in bankruptcy court for the eastern district of missouri for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
these cases have been consolidated for joint procedural administration 
holdings and its two subsidiaries are collectively called dti 
the filings enable dti to continue to conduct its business operations while attempting to resolve its financial obligations 
klt telecom agreed to provide up to million in a dip loan to digital teleport for a term of months during the bankruptcy process if it achieves certain financial goals 
the bankruptcy court approved the dip loan on february   but no advances have been made under the dip loan to date 
in december  digital teleport entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of its assets asset sale to centurytel fiber company ii  llc century tel  a nominee of centurytel  inc asset purchase agreement 
the asset sale was approved by the bankruptcy court on february   but the asset purchase agreement contains conditions to closing which include among other items the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals  which must either be satisfied or waived by july  in the digital teleport bankruptcy case  klt telecom  klt inc  kcp l  great plains energy  digital teleport and the official unsecured creditors committee of digital teleport entered into a settlement agreement as of december  teleport settlement agreement 
the teleport settlement agreement  if approved by the bankruptcy court  resolves all material issues and disputes among the parties to that agreement 
the teleport settlement agreement does not resolve any claims that holdings or its creditors may have against the company  however  as discussed below  settlement discussions have commenced in the holdings bankruptcy case 
digital teleport and digital teleport of virginia have prepared a chapter plan chapter plan and disclosure statement reflecting the asset sale and the terms of the teleport settlement agreement and expect that a confirmation hearing will be held by the bankruptcy court in may the chapter plan contemplates that digital teleport and digital teleport of virginia will be liquidated after distribution of those companies assets to their creditors pursuant to the chapter plan and the teleport settlement agreement 
in an objection to a motion by digital teleport for an extension of time in which to propose a chapter plan  the largest creditor of holdings the creditor asserted that holdings  digital teleport and their creditors have claims against klt telecom  klt inc  kcp l and great plains energy based on theories of breach of contract  fraudulent conveyance  recharacterization of debt  subordination and breach of fiduciary duty 
among other things  the creditor asserted that certain tax benefits should have been paid to holdings and digital teleport  rather than to klt telecom as provided in the october  great plains energy tax allocation agreement 
the creditor has not otherwise pursued these claims at this time  and the company believes that it has meritorious defenses to these claims 
further  holdings  the principal creditors of holdings including the creditor  klt telecom  klt inc  kcp l  and great plains energy are in the process of negotiating a separate settlement agreement which  if finalized and approved by the bankruptcy court  is anticipated to resolve the holdings bankruptcy case and any claims that might be asserted in the holdings bankruptcy case against the company  and to provide payment to the creditors of holdings from a portion of the proceeds klt telecom otherwise would receive from the asset sale 
if the separate settlement agreement is finalized  it is anticipated that the chapter plan will be modified to add holdings as a proponent and to include the terms of the holdings settlement agreement 
for further information regarding the dti bankruptcy proceedings  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the operating results of dti have been included for the period february  date of acquisition through september   for consolidated kcp l and through december   for great plains energy 
because of dti s bankruptcy filings  klt telecom no longer has control over nor can it exert significant control over dti 
as a consequence  as of december   dti was de consolidated and is presented on the cost basis 
consequently  klt telecom did not include in its financial results the ongoing results of operations  earnings or losses incurred by dti during and will not do so during the remaining period of the dti bankruptcy proceedings 
because of the bankruptcy filings  a million net write off was included in gain loss on property in operating expenses on great plains energy s consolidated statement of income 
a corresponding tax benefit of million was included in income taxes 
the net impact of the bankruptcy to income was a million reduction 
income taxes reported in do not reflect the entire effect of the net write off because of the uncertainty of recognizing future tax deductions while in the bankruptcy process 
if additional dti assets are abandoned or sold during the bankruptcy process  or additional tax losses not already reflected are incurred by dti  future tax benefits will be recorded 
other during  klt energy services wrote off its million investment in the common stock of bracknell due to a decline in its share price and the bankruptcy filing of one of bracknell s subsidiaries 
in  klt inc realized losses on its investment in cellnet data systems inc cellnet of million after tax 
significant balance sheet changes december  compared to december  o great plains energy s receivables increased million primarily due to a million increase in strategic energy s receivables as a result of the strong growth in its power supply coordination services and a million increase in consolidated kcp l s receivables partially offset by a million decrease in klt gas receivables 
consolidated kcp l s receivables increased primarily due to a million increase in kcp l s receivables due to an increase in bulk power sales 
o great plains energy s affordable housing limited partnerships decreased million primarily due to a reduction in the valuation of the properties held by klt investments 
o great plains energy s goodwill increased million due to an increase of million related to iec s purchase of a indirect ownership interest in strategic energy partially offset by a decrease in consolidated kcp l goodwill of million due to the cumulative effect write down of goodwill at rsae 
o great plains energy s other deferred charges increased million primarily due to an million increase in consolidated kcp l s other deferred charges 
consolidated kcp l s other deferred charges increase was primarily due to a million increase in kcp l s fair value of interest rate hedging derivatives and a million increase in intangible assets at rsae reflecting the purchase of a trademark and logo and the extension of an employment contract and non compete agreement with a key employee 
o great plains energy s notes payable decreased million primarily due to great plains energy paying down million of its short term credit facility with proceeds from the november equity offering 
this decrease was partially offset by great plains energy borrowings in primarily used to make a capital contribution to kcp l and a million increase in consolidated kcp l s notes payable due to additional borrowing by rsae on its short term credit facility for general corporate purposes 
o great plains energy s and consolidated kcp l s commercial paper decreased million primarily due to kcp l paying down commercial paper with cash flow from operations and a capital contribution from great plains energy 
o great plains energy s current maturities of long term debt decreased million primarily due to a million decrease in consolidated kcp l s current maturities of long term debt 
consolidated kcp l s decrease was primarily due to refinancing million of maturing kcp l medium term notes with the issuance of kcp l unsecured senior notes and a million decrease due to kcp l retiring medium term notes partially offset by a million increase in the current portion of kcp l s medium term notes 
o great plains energy s and consolidated kcp l s environmental improvement revenue refunding eirr bonds classified as current decreased million due to the remarketing of series a  b and d bonds to a five year term offset by million of series c bonds classified as current due to the scheduled remarketing in august o great plains energy s accounts payable increased million primarily due to a million increase in strategic energy s accounts payable as a result of the strong growth in its power supply coordination services  mostly offset by a million decrease in consolidated kcp l s accounts payable and a million decrease in klt gas accounts payable 
consolidated kcp l s accounts payable decreased primarily due to the timing of cash payments by kcp l 
o great plains energy s and consolidated kcp l s pension liability increased million primarily due to kcp l s million additional minimum pension liability as a result of a significant decline in the market value of pension plan assets 
o great plains energy s combined accrued taxes liability and current income tax asset increased million to a liability of million primarily due to a million increase in consolidated kcp l s accrued tax 
consolidated kcp l s increase is primarily due to a million increase in kcp l s accrued tax due to the timing of income tax payments 
capital requirements and liquidity great plains energy operates through its subsidiaries and has no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries 
great plains energy s ability to make payments on its debt securities and its ability to pay dividends is dependent on its receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries and proceeds from the sale of its securities 
great plains energy s capital requirements are principally comprised of kcp l s utility capital expenditures  klt gas capital expenditures  and kcp l s pension benefit plan funding requirements discussed below 
capital expenditures are discussed in management s discussion and analysis consolidated kcp l and klt gas sections 
additional cash and capital requirements for the companies  including long term debt requirements  are discussed below 
great plains energy s liquid resources at december   included cash flows from operations of subsidiaries  million cash on hand and million of unused bank lines of credit 
the unused lines consisted of million from kcp l s short term bank lines of credit  million from strategic energy s bank line of credit  and million from great plains energy s revolving credit facilities 
great plains energy terminated its million bridge revolving credit facility in the first quarter of and replaced it with a million day revolving credit facility syndicated with a group of banks 
also during  great plains energy entered into a million day revolving credit facility with a bank 
the million facility contains a material adverse change mac clause that requires great plains energy to represent  prior to receiving any funding  that no mac has occurred 
the million facility does not contain a mac clause 
great plains energy s available liquidity under these facilities is not impacted by a decline in credit ratings unless the downgrade occurs in the context of a merger  consolidation or sale 
the company is currently negotiating the renewal and consolidation of these facilities 
strategic energy increased its bank line of credit in to million from million 
the line of credit contains a mac clause 
this agreement requires strategic energy to represent  prior to receiving any funding  that no mac has occurred 
kcp l s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and bilateral credit lines totaling million with six banks as of december  
kcp l uses these lines to provide support for its issuance of commercial paper  which had all been repaid at december  these bank facilities are each for a day term and mature at various times throughout the year 
four of the facilities totaling million can be extended for one year under their term out provisions 
kcp l has mac clauses in two agreements covering million of available bilateral credit lines 
these two agreements require kcp l to represent  prior to receiving any funding  that no mac has occurred 
kcp l s available liquidity under these facilities is not impacted by a decline in credit ratings unless the downgrade occurs in the context of a merger  consolidation or sale 
a default by kcp l on other indebtedness is a default under these bank line agreements 
under the terms of certain bank line agreements  kcp l is required to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization ratio not greater than to at all times 
at december   the consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization ratio calculated in accordance with the covenant was to  therefore  the company was in compliance with the covenant 
under the indenture relating to kcp l s junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures  due debentures  which are held by kcp l financing i  kcp l may not declare or pay any dividends on any shares of its capital stock if at the time i there is an event of default as defined in the indenture  ii kcp l is in default with respect to its payment of any obligations under its guarantee of preferred securities issued by kcp l financing i  or iii kcp l has elected to defer payments of interest on the debentures

the presentation of the prior years statements of cash flows for great plains energy is provided for comparative purposes and is identical to the statements of cash flows for consolidated kcp l  prior to the formation of the holding company 
the effect of dti on the statements of cash flows is detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
great plains energy and consolidated kcp l generated positive cash flows from operating activities for all periods presented 
the increase for great plains energy and consolidated kcp l in compared to is due to the changes in working capital detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the individual components of working capital vary with normal business cycles and operations 
also  the timing of the wolf creek outage affects the refueling outage accrual  deferred income taxes and amortization of nuclear fuel 
the increase for great plains energy and consolidated kcp l in compared to is due to increased net income before non cash expenses 
the increased net income before non cash expenses was partially offset by the changes in working capital detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
great plains energy s and consolidated kcp l s cash used for investing activities varies with the timing of utility capital expenditures and purchases of investments and nonutility property 
investing activities are offset by the proceeds from the sale of properties and insurance recoveries 
with kcp l s mid completion of the rebuild of hawthorn no 
 utility capital expenditures and the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction decreased million in compared to and million in compared to the decreases in compared to would have been greater if not for million of kcp l capital expenditures as a result of the january ice storm 
cash used for purchases of investments and nonutility property in compared to decreased primarily reflecting klt telecom s investments in dti and dti s purchases of telecommunications property 
the increase in compared to for the dti investments and purchased property was partially offset by klt gas investments in gas properties during proceeds from the sale of properties decreased significantly in compared to because of klt gas sale of its equity ownership in patrick klt gas  llc 
proceeds from the sale of properties also decreased significantly in compared to because the proceeds from the sale of klt gas properties in more than offset the sale 
great plains energy completed a public offering of million of great plains energy common shares at per share  raising million in gross proceeds in late expenses to issue the stock totaled million  which is included in other financing activities 
great plains energy repaid million of debt balances in compared to net borrowings in of million 
included in the great plains energy s amounts  consolidated kcp l repaid million of debt balances in compared to net borrowings of million in the repayments in compared to the borrowings in reflect decreased investing activities in utility capital expenditures  nonutility property and investments discussed above 
cash from great plains energy financing activities increased in compared to primarily because short term borrowings increased million in compared to a million decrease in however  this change in short term borrowings was partially offset by a million decrease in long term debt issuances  net of repayments 
cash from consolidated kcp l financing activities increased similarly in compared to  but exclude the fourth quarter million repayment of klt inc s bank credit agreement and a fourth quarter million increase in short term borrowings by great plains energy 
on november   great plains energy entered into an agreement and plan of merger agreement with elc  the elc shareholders and iec  a wholly owned subsidiary of great plains energy

contributions of million and million were made in and  respectively 
due to sharp declines in the debt and equity markets since the third quarter of  the value of assets held in the trusts to satisfy pension plan obligations has decreased significantly 
as a result  under the minimum funding requirements of erisa  kcp l will be required to fund approximately million and million during and  respectively 
management believes kcp l has adequate access to capital resources through cash flows from operations or through existing lines of credit to support this funding 
participants in the plans may request a lump sum cash payment upon termination of their employment  which could result in increased cash requirements from pension plan assets and kcp l being required to accelerate future funding 
while it is difficult to estimate future cash requirements due to uncertain market conditions and other factors  additional funding may be required in future years 
under the terms of the pension plans  kcp l reserves the right to amend or terminate the plans  and from time to time benefits have changed

credit ratings at december   the major credit rating agencies rated the companies securities as follows moody s standard investor service and poor s great plains energy outlook negative stable corporate credit rating bbb bank credit facility baa preferred stock ba bb senior unsecured debt baa preliminary bbb preliminary subordinated debt baa preliminary bbb preliminary kcp l outlook negative stable senior secured debt a bbb senior unsecured debt a bbb commercial paper p a these ratings reflect the current views of these rating agencies and no assurances can be given that these ratings will continue for any given period of time 
the companies view maintenance of strong credit ratings as being extremely important  however  and to that end  an active and ongoing dialogue is maintained with the agencies with respect to the companies results of operations  financial position  and future prospects 
none of the companies outstanding debt  except for the notes associated with affordable housing investments discussed above  is impacted by a decline in credit ratings  which would cause the acceleration of interest and or principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade  unless the downgrade occurs in the context of a merger  consolidation  or sale 
however  in the event of a downgrade the companies and or their subsidiaries may be subject to increased interest costs on their credit facilities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s great plains energy and consolidated kcp l are exposed to market risks associated with commodity price and supply  interest rates and equity prices 
market risks are handled in accordance with established policies  which may include entering into various derivative transactions 
in the normal course of business  great plains energy and consolidated kcp l also face risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable 
such risks principally include business  legal  operational and credit risks and are not represented in the following analysis 
commodity risk kcp l and strategic energy engage in the wholesale and retail marketing of electricity and accordingly  are exposed to risk associated with the price of electricity 
kcp l s wholesale operations include the physical delivery and marketing of power obtained through its generation capacity and long  intermediate and short term capacity energy contracts 
kcp l maintains a capacity margin of at least of its peak summer demand 
this net positive supply of capacity and energy is maintained through its generation assets and capacity and power purchase agreements to protect it from the potential operational failure of one of its owned or contracted power generating units 
the agreements contain penalties for non performance to protect kcp l from energy price risk on the contracted energy 
kcp l also enters into additional power purchase agreements with the objective of obtaining the most economical energy to meet its physical delivery obligations to its customers 
kcp l continually evaluates the need for additional risk mitigation measures in order to minimize its financial exposure to  among other things  spikes in wholesale power prices during periods of high demand 
kcp l s sales include the sales of electricity to its retail customers and bulk power sales of electricity in the wholesale market 
kcp l continually evaluates its system requirements  the availability of generating units  availability and cost of fuel supply  the availability and cost of purchased power and the requirements of other electric systems  therefore  the impact of the hypothetical amounts that follow could be significantly reduced depending on the system and market prices at the time of the increases 
during  approximately of kcp l s net mwh s generated was coal fired 
a hypothetical increase in the market price of coal could have resulted in a million decrease in pretax earnings for kcp l currently has approximately of its coal requirements for under contract 
approximately of the expected delivered cost of coal is subject to the market price of coal  which is approximately one half of the amounts subject to the market price of coal in kcp l has implemented price risk mitigation measures to reduce its exposure to high natural gas prices 
a hypothetical increase in natural gas and oil market prices would have resulted in a decrease of less than million in pretax earnings 
approximately of kcp l s summer projected gas generation requirements for retail and firm wholesale sales are price protected through its hedging program  which is consistent with the percentages hedged in a hypothetical increase in the cost of purchased power could have resulted in a million decrease in pretax earnings for strategic energy maintains a commodity price risk management strategy that uses forward physical energy purchases and derivative instruments to minimize significant  unanticipated earnings fluctuations caused by commodity price volatility 
as a result of supplying electricity to retail customers under fixed rate contracts  strategic energy s policy is to match customers demand with fixed price purchases 
in certain markets where strategic energy operates  entering into forward fixed price contracts is cost prohibitive 
by entering into swap contracts for a portion of its forecasted purchases in these markets  the future purchase price of electricity is effectively fixed under these swap contracts 
the swap contracts limit the unfavorable effect that price increases will have on electricity purchases 
klt gas is exposed to commodity price risk on the natural gas it produces 
financial hedge instruments can be used to mitigate its exposure to market price fluctuations on approximately of its daily gas sales in accordance with its risk management policy 
currently  klt gas is producing an insignificant volume of gas and the price risk is minimal 
kcp l and strategic energy are not required to record energy transactions at fair value 
commitments to purchase and sell energy and energy related products except for derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges are currently carried at cost 
kcp l and strategic energy report the revenue and expense associated with all energy contracts at the time the underlying physical transaction closes consistent with industry practice and the business philosophy of generating purchasing and delivering physical power to customers 
interest rate risk great plains energy manages interest expense and short and long term liquidity through a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
generally  the amount of each type of debt is managed through market issuance  but interest rate swap and cap agreements with highly rated financial institutions may be used to achieve the desired combination 
using outstanding balances and annualized interest rates as of december   a hypothetical increase in the interest rates associated with variable rate debt would have resulted in a decrease of less than million in pretax earnings for additionally  interest rates impact the fair value of long term debt 
a change in interest rates would impact the company to the extent it redeemed any of its outstanding debt 
at december   stated values approximate fair value 
equity price risk kcp l maintains trust funds  as required by the nrc  to fund certain costs of decommissioning its wolf creek nuclear power plant 
kcp l does not expect wolf creek decommissioning to start before as of december   these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity securities and fixed income securities and are reflected at fair value on the kcp l s balance sheets 
the mix of securities is designed to provide returns to be used to fund decommissioning and to compensate for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs  however the equity securities in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets  and the value of fixed rate fixed income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates 
investment performance and asset allocation are periodically reviewed 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates resulting in a hypothetical decrease in the value of the fixed income securities would have resulted in a million reduction in the value of the decommissioning trust funds 
a hypothetical decrease in equity prices would have resulted in a million reduction in the fair value of the equity securities as of december  kcp l s exposure to equity price market risk associated with the decommissioning trust funds is in large part mitigated due to the fact that kcp l is currently allowed to recover its decommissioning costs in its rates 
klt investments has affordable housing notes that require the greater of of the outstanding note balances or the next annual installment to be held as cash  cash equivalents or marketable securities 
a hypothetical decrease in market prices of the securities held as collateral would have resulted in a decrease of less than million in pretax earnings for
