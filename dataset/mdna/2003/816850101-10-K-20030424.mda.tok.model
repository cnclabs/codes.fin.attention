item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
in addition to historical information  the discussion in this form k contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements due to factors  including but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
we assume no obligation to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of this form k 
overview we design  produce and market a broad range of products that are sold principally to customers in the computer  communications and industrial markets 
our products are designed into a wide variety of end applications  including notebook and desktop computers  computer gaming systems  personal digital assistants pdas  cellular phones  wireline networks  wireless base stations and automated test equipment ate 
products within the communications market include products for local area networks  metro and wide area networks  cellular phones and base stations 
industrial applications include ate  medical devices and factory automation systems 
our end customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers and their suppliers  including agilent  cisco  compal electronics  dell  hewlett packard  ibm  intel  lucky goldstar  microsoft  motorola  quanta computer  samsung  sony and unisys 
we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  receipt by the customer has been confirmed  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
product design and engineering revenue is recognized during the period in which services are performed 
we defer revenue recognition on shipment of certain products to distributors where return privileges exist until the products are sold through to end users 
gross profit is equal to our net sales less our cost of sales 
our cost of sales includes materials  direct labor and overhead 
we determine the cost of inventory by the first in  first out method 
our operating costs and expenses generally consist of selling  general and administrative sg a  product development and engineering costs r d  costs associated with acquisitions  and other operating related charges 
most of our sales to customers are made on the basis of individual customer purchase orders 
many large commercial customers include terms in their purchase orders  which provide liberal cancellation provisions 
trends within the industry toward shorter lead times and just in time deliveries have resulted in our reduced ability to predict future shipments 
as a result  we rely on orders received and shipped within the same quarter for a significant portion of our sales 
sales made directly to original equipment manufacturers during fiscal year were of net sales 
the remaining of net sales were made through independent distributors 
we divide and operate our business based on two reportable segments standard semiconductor products and rectifier  assembly and other products 
we evaluate segment performance based on net sales and operating income of each segment 
we do not track segment data or evaluate segment performance on additional financial information 
we do not track balance sheet items by individual reportable segments 
as such  there are no separately identifiable segment assets nor are there any separately identifiable statements of income data below operating income 
the standard semiconductor products segment makes up the vast majority of overall sales and includes our power management  protection  test and measurement formerly called high performance  advanced communications and human input device product lines 
the rectifier  assembly and other products segment includes our line of assembly and rectifier devices  which are the remaining products from our founding as a supplier into the military and aerospace market 
it also includes other products made up of custom integrated circuits and foundry sales 
our business involves reliance on foreign based entities 
most of our outside subcontractors and suppliers  including third party foundries that supply silicon wafers  are located in foreign countries  including china  malaysia  the philippines and germany 
for the fiscal year ended january   approximately calculated based on acquisition cost of our silicon was manufactured in china 
for the fiscal year ended january  
table of contents approximately of our silicon in terms of wafers purchased was manufactured in china 
foreign sales for fiscal year constituted approximately of our net sales 
approximately of foreign sales in fiscal year were to customers located in the asia pacific region  as compared to approximately in fiscal year and approximately in fiscal year the remaining sales were to customers in europe 
in the past  we have made several small acquisitions in order to increase our pool of skilled technical personnel and penetrate new market segments  such as test and measurement  advanced communications and system management devices 
these acquisitions include usar systems incorporated  practical sciences  inc  acapella limited  and edge semiconductor 
the acquisitions of usar  acapella and edge were accounted for as poolings of interests 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate and discuss with our audit committee our estimates  including those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  inventory reserves  asset impairments and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
our critical accounting policies and estimates do not vary between our two reportable segments 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the significant judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements accounting for temporary and long term investments our temporary and long term investments consist of government  bank and corporate obligations 
temporary investments have original maturities in excess of three months  but mature within twelve months of the balance sheet date 
long term investments have maturities in excess of one year from the date of the balance sheet 
in fiscal year  we changed our investment classification from hold to maturity to available for sale because we expected to sell some securities prior to maturity 
we included million and million of unrealized gain  net of tax  in the comprehensive income portion of our consolidated statements of stockholders equity and comprehensive income for fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
if we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record an allowance to reduce the net receivable to the amount we reasonably believe we will be able to collect from the customer 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if economic conditions worsen  additional allowances may be required in the future 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  receipt by the customer has been confirmed  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
product design and engineering revenue is recognized during the period in which services are performed 
we defer revenue recognition on shipment of certain products to distributors where return privileges exist until the products are sold through to end users 
in addition  we record a provision for estimated sales returns in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
we base these estimates on historical sales returns and other known factors 
actual returns could be 
table of contents different from our estimates and current provisions for sales returns and allowances  resulting in future charges to earnings 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and consist of materials  labor and overhead 
we determine the cost of inventory by the first in  first out method 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand 
in order to state our inventory at lower of cost or market  we maintain reserves against our inventory 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  a write down of inventory may be required  and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period the revision is made 
contingencies and litigation we are involved in various disputes and litigation matters as a claimant and as defendant 
we record any amounts recovered in these matters when collection is certain 
we record liabilities for claims against us when the losses are probable and estimable 
any amounts recorded are based on reviews by outside counsel  in house counsel and management 
actual results may differ from estimates 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
management continually evaluates its deferred tax asset as to whether it is likely that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
if management ever determined that its deferred tax asset was not likely to be realized  a write down of that asset would be required and would be reflected as a cost in the accompanying period 
reclassifications certain prior year balances have been reclassified to be consistent with our current year presentation and to reflect changes in recently issued accounting standards 
in the prior year  gain on the extinguishment of debt was originally classified as an extraordinary item 
in compliance with a recently issued accounting standard  gain on the extinguishment of debt is included in interest and other income  net in fiscal year and all prior year amounts have been reclassified as such see recently issued accounting standards for more information 
results of operations fiscal year compared with fiscal year net sales 
net sales for fiscal year were million  an increase of compared to million for fiscal year semiconductor and electronics industry conditions  as well as overall macro economic conditions remained weak during fiscal year  following difficult market conditions in fiscal year weak unit demand coupled with declines in average selling prices impacted the ability to grow net sales  especially in the desktop computer end market segment 
sales into the capital equipment end markets  specifically the automated test equipment ate and telecommunications segments  were also down compared to prior years 

table of contents standard semiconductor products represented of net sales in fiscal year  while were represented by the rectifier  assembly and other products segment 
sales of our standard semiconductor products segment increased in fiscal year  while rectifier  assembly and other products sales declined 
increased sales of standard semiconductor products reflected strength in computer gaming applications and portable applications  such as notebook computers and cellular phones 
strength in these end applications was partially offset by weakness in the desktop computer  ate and other capital intensive end market segments 
our power management product line has benefited from strength in portable applications  while being negatively impacted by weakness in desktop computers 
weakness in the capital equipments markets has negatively impacted our test and measurement and advanced communications product lines 
sales of our rectifier  assembly and other products segment shrank in fiscal year due to declining demand for these older technology products and other non strategic product offerings which we have de emphasized due to their lower growth and profit margin opportunities 
sales of our standard semiconductor products and rectifier  assembly and other products segments were both weak and declined dramatically from the prior year 
the decline in sales in the standard semiconductor products segment was due to both weak industry conditions and weak demand from customers 
only the power management product line within the standard semiconductor products segment grew in fiscal year  while all other product lines in the segment declined 
sales of our rectifier  assembly and other products segment declined due to weak industry conditions  a strategic focus on proprietary products and a strategic de emphasis of custom and foundry services 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal year was million  compared to million for the prior year 
this increase was due to slightly higher sales and higher gross margin due in part to the absence of a write down of inventory and discontinuation of certain products that occurred in fiscal year our gross margin was for fiscal year  compared to a gross margin of for fiscal year the write down of inventory and discontinuation of certain products during fiscal year was the result of a critical review we conducted during that year 
a severe industry downturn and a related drop in demand from end customers made certain inventories excess and obsolete  and certain product lines non strategic 
of the million write down of inventory and discontinuation of certain products  million was associated with the standard semiconductor products segment and  with the rectifier  assembly and other products segment 
in fiscal year and fiscal year  we sold million and  respectively  of inventory of the standard semiconductor products segment that had been reserved during the second quarter of fiscal year operating costs and expenses 
operating costs and expenses were million  or of net sales  for the fiscal year operating costs and expenses for fiscal year were million  or of net sales 
the increase in absolute dollars of operating costs and expenses was the result of modest increases in spending in the areas of sales  general and administration  and research and development 
the increase in absolute dollars of operating costs and expenses was also impacted by higher one time costs in fiscal year operating costs and expenses for fiscal year include one time costs of million  which included million of cost associated with the standard semiconductor products segment for the settlement of a customer dispute   of cost not assigned to a reportable segment for an expected loss on the future sub lease of the our new york office and  of cost assigned to a reportable segment for asset impairment at the corpus christi  texas wafer fabrication facility 
operating costs and expenses for fiscal year include one time cost not assigned to a reportable segment of million associated with an approximate person reduction in headcount made in the first half of the year and one time cost not assigned to a reportable segment of  associated with a pending superfund settlement 
as of january   substantially all of the one time headcount reduction costs have been paid out in cash 
operating income 
operating income was million in fiscal year  up from operating income of million in fiscal year operating income was impacted by a slight increase in net sales and improvement in gross margin 

table of contents we evaluate segment performance based on net sales and operating income of each segment 
operating income for the standard semiconductor products segment increased in fiscal year  having benefited by a increase in sales and higher gross margin 
standard semiconductor products segment operating income in fiscal year was negatively impacted by a one time cost of million for the settlement of a customer dispute 
gross margin and operating income for the standard semiconductor products segment was negatively impact in fiscal year by a million write down of inventory and discontinuation of certain products within the standard semiconductor products segment 
operating income for the rectifier  assembly and other products segment declined by in fiscal year the rectifier  assembly and other products operating income decline reflected poor efficiencies associated with a lower sales level 
operating income for the standard semiconductor products segment was weak in fiscal year operating income for the standard semiconductor products in fiscal year was hurt by a large decline in sales and lower gross and operating margins 
operating income for the rectifier  assembly and other products segment declined in fiscal year  reflecting poor efficiencies associated with a lower sales level 
interest and other income  net 
net interest and other income of million was realized in fiscal year  up from million in fiscal year other income and expenses includes interest income from investments  interest expense associated with our outstanding convertible subordinated notes  and gain on the extinguishment of debt 
the increase in interest and other income in fiscal year was mostly due to million of gain on the extinguishment of debt 
the interest income portion of interest and other income for fiscal year was down due to lower rates of return on our investments as compared to the prior year 
interest and other income in fiscal year included million of gain on the extinguishment of debt 
provision for taxes 
provision for income taxes was million for the fiscal year ended january   compared to million in the fiscal year ended january  the effective tax rate for fiscal year and fiscal year were and  respectively 
the decline is due to increased sales by our foreign based subsidiaries that are in lower tax jurisdictions 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year net sales 
net sales for fiscal year were million  a decline of compared to million for fiscal year overall semiconductor industry conditions were very weak during fiscal year  as were the end markets that we serve 
the weakest end markets for fiscal year were the industrial market and the wireline portion of the communications market 
standard semiconductor products represented about of net sales in fiscal year  while rectifier  assembly and other products sales made up the balance 
sales of our standard semiconductor products segment shrank in fiscal year rectifier  assembly and other products sales declined in fiscal year the decline in sales in the standard semiconductor products segment was due to both weak industry conditions and weak demand from customers 
only the power management product line within the standard semiconductor products segment grew in the year  while all other product lines in the segment declined 
the power management product line benefited from strength in computer and wireless applications 
the largest absolute dollar declines in net sales within the segment were in our protection and test and measurement product lines 
the protection product line was hurt by weakness in the wireline segment of the communications market and price declines in portable applications 
test and measurement product line sales were impacted by a severe downturn in the ate portion of the industrial market 
sales of our rectifier  assembly and other products segment declined due to weak industry conditions  a strategic focus on proprietary products and a strategic de emphasis of custom and foundry services 
we plan to eventually exit the custom and foundry product offerings 
in fiscal year  favorable market conditions benefited our two reportable segments 
the standard semiconductor products segment was most benefited by a large increase in sales of our test and measurement and 
table of contents protection product lines 
on an absolute dollar basis  these two product lines had the largest impact on our increase in net sales 
sales of these two product lines were benefited by strength in the communications end market and the test equipment area of the industrial end market 
our power management product line also part of our standard semiconductor products segment sales grew only slightly in fiscal year due in part to weak demand from computer related customers 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal year was million  compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease was due to lower sales levels in both of our reportable segments and one time cost of million for the write down of inventory and discontinuation of certain products during the second quarter 
our gross margin was for fiscal year ended january   compared to a gross margin of for fiscal year ended january  the write down of inventory and discontinuation of certain products during the second quarter was the result of a critical review we conducted during that quarter 
a severe industry downturn and a related drop in demand from end customers made certain inventories excess and obsolete  and certain product lines non strategic 
of the million write down of inventory and discontinuation of certain products  million was associated with the standard semiconductor products segment and  with the rectifier  assembly and other products segment 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a one time gain of  on the sale of inventory of the standard semiconductor products segment that had been reserved during the second quarter 
operating costs and expenses 
operating costs and expenses were million  or of net sales  for the fiscal year operating costs and expenses for fiscal year were million  or of net sales 
the decline in absolute dollars of operating costs and expenses was the result of cost cutting measures  which included headcount reductions and declines in variable expense items 
despite an absolute drop in operating costs and expenses  these costs went up as a percent of net sales due to the much lower revenue base 
operating costs and expenses for fiscal year include one time costs of million associated with an approximate person reduction in headcount made in the first half of the year and one time costs of  associated with a pending superfund settlement 
operating income 
operating income was million in fiscal year  down from operating income of million in fiscal year operating income was impacted by a decline in net sales  a drop to gross margin and one time costs of million related to headcount reductions and a pending superfund settlement 
we evaluate segment performance based on net sales and operating income of each segment 
operating income for the standard semiconductor products segment declined in fiscal year operating income in the standard semiconductor products segment was benefited by an increase in power management product line sales and was most hurt by large declines in our protection  and test and measurement product lines 
in fiscal year  the test and measurement product line had operating margins above our consolidated average 
operating income for the rectifier  assembly and other products segment declined by in fiscal year rectifier  assembly and other products operating income decline reflected poor efficiencies associated with a lower sales level 
operating income for the standard semiconductor products segment in fiscal year was benefited by a significant increase in our protection and test and measurement product line sales  which had above corporate average operating margins 
operating income for the rectifier  assembly and other products segment increased in fiscal year due to a shift in manufacturing to our lower cost facility in mexico and reduced overhead 
interest and other income 
net interest and other income of million was realized in fiscal year for fiscal year  interest and other income was million 
other income and expenses includes interest income from investments  interest expense associated with our outstanding convertible subordinated notes  and gain on the extinguishment of debt 
the decline in interest and other income in fiscal year was mostly due to lower rates of return on our investments as compared to the prior year  partially offset by million of gain on the extinguishment of debt

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we evaluate segment performance based on net sales and operating income of each segment 
we do not track segment data or evaluate segment performance on additional financial information 
as such  there are no separately identifiable segment assets and liabilities 
on february   we completed a private offering of million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes that bear interest at the rate of per annum and are convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the notes are due in and callable beginning in february of pursuant to a registration rights agreement  we were obligated to register the resale of the notes on behalf of the holders and to maintain the effectiveness of the registration until the holders could otherwise resell the notes under exemptions from registration 
our obligation to keep the registration statement effective has terminated  and on august   we filed a post effective amendment to de register the notes and conversion shares that had not been sold under the prospectus contained in the registration statement 
the post effective amendment was effective on september  we have used the net proceeds of the notes offering  in part  for general corporate purposes  including working capital  expansion of sales  marketing and customer service capabilities  and product development 
in addition  we may use a portion of the net proceeds from the notes offering to acquire or invest in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products 
as of january   we had working capital of million  compared with million as of january  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities as of january  was to  compared to to as of january  the increase in working capital as of january  was mostly the result of an increase in cash and cash equivalents  partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities and other items 
cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year net operating cash flows were impacted by non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
net operating cash flows in fiscal year were positively impacted by net income of million and by a decrease in inventories and receivables  increases in accrued liabilities  tax benefit from stock option exercises  income taxes payable  loss on the disposition of property  plant and equipment and other assets 
these were partially offset by increases in gains on repurchase of long term debt  accounts payable  deferred revenue and other liabilities 
investing activities provided million in fiscal year compared to a use of million in the prior year 
investing activities for both periods consist of changes in temporary investments and long term investments  and cash used for capital expenditures 
investing activities for fiscal year included proceeds of  from the sale of assets 
our financing activities used million during fiscal year and million in the prior year period 
financing activities in fiscal year reflect the proceeds from stock option exercises  which were more than offset by cash used to repurchase long term debt and common stock 
financing activities for fiscal year reflect the proceeds from stock options exercises and the reissuance of treasury stock  more than offset by cash used to repurchase long term debt and common stock 
in order to develop  design and manufacture new products  we have incurred significant expenditures during the past five years 
we expect to continue these investments aimed at developing new products  including the hiring of many design and applications engineers and related purchase of equipment 
our intent is to continue to invest in those areas that have shown potential for viable and profitable market opportunities 
certain of these expenditures  particularly the addition of design engineers  do not generate significant payback in the short term 
we plan to finance these expenditures with cash generated by operations and investments 
purchases of new capital equipment were made to complete our corporate headquarters in camarillo  california  expand our test capacity and support other engineering functions  including product design and qualification 
these purchases were funded from our operating cash flows and cash reserves 
we believe that operating cash flows  together with the proceeds of the notes offering and cash reserves  are sufficient to fund operations and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any transactions  arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to affect our liquidity or capital resources 
we have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provided off balance sheet financing  liquidity or market or credit risk support  engage in leasing  hedging  research and development services  or other relationships that expose us to liability that is not reflected on the face of the financial statements 
contractual obligations as of january   we have approximately million in operating lease commitments that extend over an eight year period 
the portion of these operating lease payments due during fiscal year fiscal is approximately million 
presented below is a comprehensive summary of contractual obligations 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations we have a contract purchase obligations in table above with one of our third party wafer foundries in which we guarantee that wafer foundry a certain minimum level of quarterly business 
under the contract  which runs from april of until june of  we have agreed to buy approximately million of fabricated silicon wafers on a calendar quarter basis from this foundry 
if we do not meet this minimum obligation on a quarterly basis  we are obligated to pay the difference 
we can earn back any shortfall in a given quarter by purchasing more wafers in a subsequent quarter

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s foreign currency risk as a global enterprise  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
because of the relatively small size of each individual currency exposure  we do not employ hedging techniques designed to mitigate foreign currency exposures 
likewise  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
our foreign currency exposures may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could have an adverse impact upon our financial results 
certain of our assets  including certain bank accounts and accounts receivable  exist in nondollar denominated currencies  which are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the nondollar denominated currencies are principally the euro  swiss francs and british pounds sterling 
additionally  certain of our current and long term liabilities are denominated principally in british pounds sterling currency  which are also sensitive to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
substantially all of our foreign sales are denominated in united states dollars 
currency exchange fluctuations in countries where we do business could harm our business by resulting in pricing that is not competitive with prices denominated in local currencies 
interest rate risk as of january   we had million in long term debt outstanding at a fixed interest rate of per annum 
we do not currently hedge any potential interest rate exposure 
interest rates affect our return on excess cash and investments 
a significant decline in interest rates would reduce the amount of interest income generated from our excess cash and investments
