item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on form k 
overview ciena is a leading global provider of innovative network solutions to service providers and enterprises worldwide 
our customers include long distance carriers  local exchange carriers  cable operators  internet service providers  wireless and wholesale carriers  resellers  governments  large businesses and non profit institutions 
for several years  the market for our equipment was influenced by the entry of a substantial number of new companies into the communications services business 
in the united states  this was largely due to changes in the regulatory environment  in particular those brought about by the telecommunications act of these new companies raised billions of dollars in capital  much of which they invested in capital improvements  causing acceleration in the growth of the market for telecommunications equipment 
the last three years have seen a reversal of this trend  including the failure of a large number of the new entrants and a sharp contraction of the availability of capital to the industry 
several of the more established carriers also have experienced significant financial distress 
these developments have caused a substantial reduction in demand for telecommunications equipment  including our products 
this industry trend was compounded by the slowing not only of the united states economy  but the economies in virtually all of the countries in which we are marketing our products 
the combination of factors caused our customers to become more conservative in their capital investment plans and more uncertain about their future purchases 
as a consequence  we are facing a market that is both reduced in size and more difficult to predict and plan for 
these trends have had a number of significant effects on our business during fiscal and  including the reduction of revenue by  million since fiscal  the incurrence of million of costs related to obsolete inventory and excess purchase commitments during fiscal  restructuring charges of million and million during fiscal and  respectively  goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of million and million during fiscal and  respectively  provisions for bad debt expense of million during fiscal  million and million in losses on equity investments during fiscal and  respectively  and a net income tax charge of approximately million during fiscal to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
our net losses of million and  million  in fiscal and  respectively  were primarily attributable to the factors listed above 
in response to the deterioration of our market  we have  since  entered new markets by expanding our network solution offerings and worked to increase our market share by adding new features to our existing products 
we also have taken steps to expand our sales channels beyond direct sales to service providers to include partnerships and other strategic relationships targeting enterprise and government customers 
we plan to continue to pursue this strategy by adding new products and features to our portfolio  primarily targeting delivery of data communications services because we expect a large portion of carrier spending to occur in this area over the next few years 
as part of our efforts to implement our strategy  during fiscal  we completed the acquisitions of wavesmith networks  inc and akara corporation 
wavesmith was a privately held corporation offering a multi service switching product designed to be deployed at the edge of carrier networks 
akara was a privately held corporation providing sonet sdh based extended storage solutions 
as of october   ciena and its subsidiaries employed approximately  persons  which was a net reduction of persons from the approximate  employed on october  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires ciena to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  ciena re evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  goodwill  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
ciena bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
among other things  these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
ciena believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition ciena recognizes product revenue in accordance with the terms of the contract of sale and where collection is reasonably assured 
for transactions in which sales are not complete until the customer has accepted the product  revenue is not recognized until the terms of acceptance are satisfied 
revenue for installation services is recognized as the services are performed unless the terms of the supply contract combine product acceptance with installation  in which case  revenue from installation services is recognized when the terms of acceptance are satisfied and installation is completed 
amounts received in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred revenue in the balance sheet 
for transactions involving the sale of software  revenue is recognized in accordance with statement of position no 
sop  software revenue recognition  including deferral of revenue recognition in instances where vendor specific objective evidence for undelivered elements is not determinable 
for distributor sales where risks of ownership have not transferred  ciena recognizes revenue when the product is shipped through to the end user 
allowances for doubtful accounts ciena maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of ciena s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
as of october   our accounts receivable balance  net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million  was million  which included three customers that accounted for   and of the net trade accounts receivable 
warranties ciena provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
ciena engages in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers and third party contractors 
ciena s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from ciena s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
reserve for inventory obsolescence ciena writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
during the fiscal year ended october   ciena recorded a benefit for inventory reserves of million primarily related to the realization of sales from previously reserved excess inventory 
if actual market conditions differ from those ciena has projected  ciena may be required to take additional inventory write downs or to record additional benefits 
restructuring as part of its restructuring costs  ciena provides for the estimated cost of the net lease expense for facilities that are no longer being utilized 
the provision is equal to the future minimum lease payments under contractual obligations offset by estimated future sublease payments 
as of the end of fiscal  ciena s accrued restructuring liability related to net consolidation of excess facilities is million 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those ciena has projected  ciena may be required to recognize additional restructuring costs associated with these facilities 
minority investments ciena holds minority interests in several companies having operations or technology in areas within its strategic focus 
as of october   million of these investments are included in other long term assets 
ciena records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
during fiscal  ciena record a charge of million associated with the impairment of one of these investments 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets effective november   ciena adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas and ceased to amortize goodwill 
as of october   ciena s assets include million related to goodwill 
sfas requires that we cease to amortize goodwill and to test it for impairment on an annual basis  and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of ciena below its carrying value 
since no event occurred or circumstances changed during fiscal that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of ciena below its carrying value  no impairment was recorded in fiscal if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we have projected or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of ciena below its carrying value  we may be required to recognize additional goodwill impairment charges 
as part of ciena s review of financial results for fiscal  ciena performed an assessment of the carrying value of the company s long lived assets  including other intangible assets 
the assessment was performed pursuant to statement financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
as a result  ciena recorded a charge of million during fiscal  related to the impairment of metrodirector k technology acquired in the cyras transaction 
this charge was based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the developed technology exceeded its fair value 
fair value was determined based on discounted future cash flows derived from the developed technology  which had separately identifiable cash flows 
the assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows  including the discount rate reflect management s best estimates 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we have projected or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of our long lived assets below their carrying value  we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges 
deferred tax valuation allowance as of october   ciena has recorded a valuation allowance of million against our gross deferred tax assets of million 
we calculated the valuation allowance in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
positive evidence  such as operating results during the most recent three year period  is given more weight when due to our current lack of visibility  there is a greater degree of uncertainty that the level of future profitability needed to record the deferred assets will be achieved 
our results over the most recent three year period were heavily affected by our recent deliberate and planned business restructuring activities 
our cumulative loss in the most recent three year period represents sufficient negative evidence to require a valuation allowance under the provisions of sfas we intend to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
accounting for stock options in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas allows companies to account for stock based compensation either under the new provisions of sfas or using the intrinsic value method provided by accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  but requires pro forma disclosure in the footnotes to the financial statements as if the measurement provisions of sfas had been adopted 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
sfas amends sfas  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
sfas is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  we have elected to continue to account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of apb as interpreted by fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report  including the reports we incorporate by reference  you should consider the following factors before investing in our securities 
our business could continue to be adversely affected by unfavorable and uncertain conditions in the communications industry the last three years have seen substantial changes in the communications industry 
most of our customers and potential customers have confronted static or declining revenue 
many have experienced significant financial distress  and some have gone out of business 
this has resulted in a significant change in the structure of the equipment industry  with greater concentration of purchasing power in a small number of large services providers  combined with a substantial reduction in overall demand 
together these factors have adversely affected our revenue and operating results 
in addition  most of our customers have become more conservative and uncertain about their future purchases which has made managing our business difficult 
we expect the factors described above to continue to affect our business for an indeterminate period  in several significant ways capital expenditures by many of our customers may be flat or reduced  we will continue to have only limited ability to forecast the volume and product mix of our sales  managing our expenditures will be difficult in light of the uncertainties surrounding our business  increased competition resulting from reduced demand will put substantial downward pressures on the pricing of our products  tending to reduce our profit margins  increased competition will enable customers to insist on more favorable terms and conditions for sales  including extended payment terms or other financing assistance  as a condition of procuring their business  and the bankruptcies or weakened financial condition of some of our customers may require us to write off amounts due to us from prior sales 
the result of any one or a combination of these factors could lead to further reduced revenue and increased operating losses 
we face intense competition that could hurt our sales and profitability the market for networking solutions is extremely competitive 
competition in this market is based on varying combinations of price  functionality  manufacturing capability  installation  services  scalability and the ability of the system solutions to meet customers immediate and future network requirements 
a small number of very large companies  including alcatel  cisco  fujitsu  hitachi  huawei  lucent  marconi  nec  nortel  siemens  ericsson  and tellabs have historically dominated the telecommunications equipment industry 
they all have greater financial  marketing  manufacturing and intellectual property resources than ciena 
they also often have existing relationships with our customers and potential customers 
we also compete with a number of smaller companies that provide significant competition 
because we sell systems that compete directly with product offerings of these companies  and in some cases displace or replace their equipment  we represent a competitive threat 
the decline in the market for communications networking products has resulted in even greater competitive pressures 
we expect that the aggressive tactics we have confronted on the part of many of these competitors will continue  and perhaps become more severe 
these tactics include intense price competition in sales of new equipment  resulting in lower profit margins  discounting resulting from sales of used equipment or inventory that a competitor has written down or written off  early announcements of competing products and other marketing efforts  one stop shopping options  customer financing assistance  marketing and advertising assistance  and intellectual property disputes 
tactics such as those described above can be particularly effective in a concentrated customer base like ours 
our customers are under increasing competitive pressure to deliver their services at the lowest possible cost 
this pressure may result in the pricing of communications networking systems becoming a more important factor in customer decisions 
this may favor larger competitors that can spread the effect of price discounts across a larger array of products and services and across a larger customer base than ours 
if we are unable to offset any reductions in the average sales price for our products by a reduction in the cost of our products  our gross profit margins will be adversely affected 
our inability to compete successfully against our competitors and maintain our gross profit margins would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
new competitors continue to emerge to compete with our products 
they often base their products on the latest available technology 
they may achieve commercial availability of their products more quickly due to the narrower focus of their efforts 
our inability to compete successfully against these companies would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the success of our strategy depends on our ability to increase our revenue substantially we have deliberately chosen to continue to spend on research and development  sales and marketing  and other operating expenses at levels that will not permit us to return to profitability unless we can increase our revenue substantially 
in order to do so  we plan both to continue to maintain and enhance our existing products and to expand and diversify our product portfolio 
in addition we believe we must continue to maintain a significant sales presence in our principle markets and to spend on marketing our products and services 
we are implementing this strategy through a combination of internal development  acquisitions of smaller companies  and strategic alliances with other vendors 
if we fail to execute this strategy effectively  or it does not produce substantial revenue growth  we will be required to modify the strategy  which would likely have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
our future success will depend on our ability to sell our products to our existing incumbent carrier customers and add additional incumbent carriers as new customers historically  a large percentage of our sales were made to emerging carriers  many of which no longer exist or have experienced severe financial difficulties and have reduced their equipment purchases 
we expect that our sales to emerging carriers will continue to be at a lower level than they were at one time 
consequently  our future success will depend  to a large extent  on our ability to increase our sales to large domestic and international incumbent carriers 
we have limited experience in selling to incumbent carriers relative to many of our larger competitors 
many of them have long standing relationships with incumbent carriers  which present additional challenges to the sales process 
the sales cycles for these larger customers is often substantially longer than for sales to smaller customers  and they often require extensive testing of products before deciding to purchase them 
in addition  even after a product has been selected for an incumbent carrier s network and a contract has been signed  we are typically unable to recognize revenue until final network certification tests are completed satisfactorily  a process that is often lengthy and difficult 
complying with these certification requirements may involve unanticipated delays that could adversely affect our ability to sell to larger carriers or the timing of recognition of revenue 
if we do not succeed in increasing our sales to our existing incumbent carrier customers and adding additional incumbent carriers as customers  our business will suffer 
we may not be successful in selling our products through new channels or to government customers we believe that  in order to succeed  we must enter new markets and build a larger and more diverse customer base 
therefore  we are beginning to sell some of our products to large enterprises and federal  state and local governments 
to succeed in these markets  we believe we must develop and manage new sales channels through resellers  distributors and systems integrators for sales of those of our products that are suitable for those markets 
since we have only limited experience in developing and managing such channels  it is uncertain to what extent we will be successful 
sales to federal  state and local governments often require compliance with complex procurement rules and regulations with which we have little experience 
we may be unable to compete for government opportunities if we cannot comply with these rules and regulations 
our failure either to develop and manage new sales channels or to sell to government customers would adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned levels of revenue  which would adversely affect our profitability 
our strategy involves pursuing strategic acquisitions and investments that may not be successful our business strategy includes acquiring or making strategic investments in other companies to expand our portfolio of products and services and to acquire or accelerate the development of new or improved products 
to do so  we may use cash  issue equity that would dilute our current shareholders ownership  incur debt or assume indebtedness 
in addition  we may incur significant amortization expenses related to intangible assets 
in the fourth quarter fiscal and fourth quarter fiscal  we incurred a significant write off of goodwill associated with our previous acquisitions 
strategic investments and acquisitions involve numerous risks  including potential large cash expenditures  difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention  potential difficulties in completing projects of the acquired company  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  dependence on unfamiliar or relatively small supply partners  and exposure to unanticipated liabilities 
in addition  acquisitions and strategic investments may involve risks of entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience and competitors have stronger market positions 
product performance problems could limit our sales prospects the development and production of new products with high technology content often involves problems with software  components and manufacturing methods 
if significant reliability  quality or network monitoring problems develop  including those due to defects in software or faulty components  a number of negative effects on our business could result  including costs associated with fixing software or hardware defects  high service and warranty expenses  payment of liquidated damages for performance failures  high inventory obsolescence expense  high levels of product returns  delays in collecting accounts receivable  reduced orders from existing customers  and declining interest from potential customers 
although we maintain accruals for product warranties  actual costs could exceed these amounts 
from time to time  there will be interruptions or delays in the activation of our products at a customer s site 
these interruptions or delays may result from product performance problems or from issues with installation and activation  some of which are outside our control 
if we experience significant interruptions or delays that we cannot promptly resolve  confidence in our products could be undermined  which could cause us to lose customers or otherwise harm our business 
economic conditions require us to reduce the size of our business further since november  we have taken several steps  including reductions in force and dispositions of assets to reduce the size of our operations to better match the reduced sales of our products and services 
weakness in the telecommunications equipment market continues to affect our business 
accordingly  during the next twelve months we believe that we will be required to reduce our costs further 
this could cause disruption in our business and require us to take accounting charges 
if we fail to execute effectively on a program of cost reductions  our profitability could suffer 
selling our products requires substantial investments of our resources that may not produce anticipated benefits in order to sell our products to both potential and existing customers  we must invest in financial  engineering  manufacturing and logistics support resources  even though we are unsure of the volume  duration or timing of customer purchases 
our customers are generally technically sophisticated and demanding 
consequently  we may incur substantial expenses and devote resources to potential relationships that never materialize or fulfill our expectations  in which event our investment may largely be lost 
for example  we often provide equipment and services to our customers  free of charge  for the purpose of performing laboratory testing 
in the quarter ended october   inventory increased as a result of providing a large amount of test equipment to a potential customer 
if we are unsuccessful in winning this contract  we may be required to take a charge for the write down or write off of this inventory 
our results can fluctuate unpredictably purchases by many of our potential and existing customers can be unpredictable  sporadic and subject to unanticipated changes 
our results  in turn  can fluctuate unpredictably 
a decision to purchase our products requires a significant investment and commitment of resources by our customers 
as a result  the sales cycles for many of our products are long  often as much as a year or two between initial contact with a potential customer and the recognition of revenue from sales to the customer 
further  purchases by our existing customers tend to be large and sporadic  depending upon their need to build a customer base  their plans for expanding their networks  the availability of financing  and the effects of regulatory and business conditions in the countries in which they operate 
current economic and market conditions have made it even more difficult to make reliable estimates of future revenue 
fluctuations in our revenue can lead to even greater fluctuations in our operating profits 
our budgeted expense levels depend in part on our expectations of long term future revenue 
any substantial adjustment to expenses to account for lower levels of revenue is difficult and takes time 
consequently  if our revenue does decline  our levels of inventory  operating expenses and general overhead would be high relative to our revenue  resulting in additional operating losses 
other factors can also contribute to fluctuations in our revenue and operating results  including variations and the mix between higher and lower margin products and services  fluctuations in demand for our products  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  the timing and size of orders from customers  changes in customers requirements  including changes or cancellations to orders from customers  the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  changes in the price or availability of components for our products  readiness of customer sites for installation  satisfaction of contractual customer acceptance criteria and related revenue recognition issues  manufacturing and shipment delays and deferrals  increased service  installation  warranty or repair costs  the timing and amount of employer payroll tax to be paid on employee gains on stock options exercised  and changes in general economic conditions as well as those specific to the telecommunications industry 
we may not be successful in enhancing and upgrading our products the market for communications networking solutions is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent introductions of new products  and recurring changes in customer requirements 
to succeed in this market  we must continue to develop new products and new features for existing products 
doing so is difficult and costly  and there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful 
in addition  we must be able to identify and gain access to promising new technologies 
failure to keep pace with technological advances would impair the competitiveness of our products and sooner or later do serious harm to our business 
our products are based on complex technology that could result in unanticipated delays in developing  improving  manufacturing or deploying them 
modifying our products to enable customers to integrate them into a new type of network architecture entails similar development risks 
certain enhancements to our products are in the development phase and are not yet ready for commercial manufacturing or deployment 
the maturing process from laboratory prototype to customer trials  and subsequently to general availability  involves a number of steps  including completion of product development  the qualification and multiple sourcing of critical components  validation of manufacturing methods and processes  extensive quality assurance and reliability testing  and staffing of testing infrastructure  validation of software  and establishment of systems integration and systems test validation requirements 
each of these steps  in turn  presents serious risks of failure  rework or delay  any one of which could decrease the speed and scope of product introduction and marketplace acceptance of the product 
specialized application specific integrated circuits asics and intensive software testing and validation are key to the timely introduction of enhancements to several of our products  and schedule delays are common in the final validation phase  as well as in the manufacture of specialized asics 
in addition  unexpected intellectual property disputes  failure of critical design elements  and a host of other execution risks may delay or even prevent the introduction of these products 
if we do not develop and successfully introduce these products in a timely manner  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be harmed 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers  and for some items we do not have a substitute supplier we depend on a limited number of suppliers for components of our products  as well as for equipment used to manufacture and test our products 
our products include several high performance components for which reliable  high volume suppliers are particularly limited 
furthermore  some key optical and electronic components we use in our products are currently available only from sole or limited sources  and in some cases  that source also is a competitor 
any delay in component availability for any of our products could result in delays in deployment of these products and in our ability to recognize revenue 
these delays could also harm our customer relationships and our results of operations 
furthermore  the market for optical components has recently been consolidated resulting in reduced competition  which could lead to higher prices 
in addition  the loss of a source of supply of key components could require us to re engineer products that use those components  which would increase our costs 
on occasion  we have experienced delays in receipt of components and have received components that do not perform according to their specifications 
any future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of components could result in delays or reductions in product shipments  which  in turn  could harm our business 
any delays in component availability for any of our products or test equipment could result in delays in deployment of these products and in our ability to recognize revenue from them 
these delays could also harm our customer relationships and our results of operations 
we rely on contract manufacturers for our products we rely on a small number of contract manufacturers to perform the majority of the manufacturing operations for our products 
the qualification of these manufacturers is an expensive and time consuming process  and these contract manufacturers build modules for other companies  including our competitors 
in addition  we do not have contracts in place with some of these manufacturers 
we may not be able to effectively manage our relationships with our manufacturers and we cannot be certain that they will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner 
if we underestimate our future product requirements  the contract manufacturers may not have enough product to meet our customer requirements  and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to recognize revenue 
if we overestimate product requirements  we may have to write off excess inventory 
we rely on service delivery partners we rely on a number of service delivery partners  both domestic and international  to complement ciena s global service and support resources 
the certification of these partners incurs costs and is time consuming  and these partners service products for other companies  including our competitors 
we may not be able to effectively manage our relationships with our partners and we cannot be certain that they will be able to deliver our services in the manner or time required 
if our service partners are unsuccessful in delivering services  we may compromise the relevant services revenue  and we may suffer delays in recognizing product revenues in cases were revenue recognition is dependent upon product installation  testing and acceptance 
our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights or if we infringe on intellectual property rights of others we share our proprietary information and intellectual property  including our source code  with other parties as necessary to meet the needs of our business 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
we enter into non disclosure and proprietary rights agreements with our employees and consultants  license agreements with our corporate partners  and we control access to and distribution of our products  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
this is likely to become an increasing issue as we expand our operations and sales into countries that provide a lower level of protection for intellectual property 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology 
if competitors are able to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be harmed 
we have filed a patent infringement lawsuit to enforce our intellectual property right  and may become involved with additional disputes in the future 
such lawsuits can be costly and may significantly divert the time and attention of our personnel 
we have been subject to several claims of patent infringement  which in some cases have required us to pay the patent holders substantial sums or enter into license agreements requiring ongoing royalty payments 
the frequency of assertions of patent infringement in the field of telecommunications networking solutions is increasing as patent holders seek alternative sources of revenue 
there is a possibility that we may again find ourselves required to take patent licenses or to redesign or stop selling products that allegedly infringe patents belonging to others 
if we are sued for infringement and are unsuccessful in defending the suit  we could be subject to significant damages  and our business and customer relationships could be adversely affected 
we face risks associated with our international operations we market  sell and service our products globally 
we have established offices around the world  including in north america  europe  latin america and the asia pacific region 
we will continue to expand our international operations and enter new international markets 
this expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources to develop successfully direct and indirect international sales and support channels 
in some countries  our success will depend in part on our ability to form relationships with local partners 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to identify appropriate partners or reach mutually satisfactory arrangements with them for sales of our products 
there is a risk that we may sometimes choose the wrong partner 
for these reasons  we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
international operations are subject to inherent risks  and our future results could be adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors 
these include greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  certification requirements  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  political and economic instability  trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements  service provider and government spending patterns  and natural disasters and epidemics 
such factors could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
we face risks in reselling the products of other companies we have recently entered into agreements that permit us to distribute the products of other companies and may enter into other agreements in the future 
to the extent we succeed in reselling the products of these companies  we may be required by customers to assume warranty and service obligations 
while these suppliers have agreed to support us with respect to those obligations  they are relatively small companies with limited financial resources 
if they should be unable  for any reason  to provide the required support  we may have to expend our own resources on doing so 
this risk is amplified by the fact that the equipment has been designed and manufactured by others  and is thus subject to warranty claims whose magnitude we are currently unable to evaluate fully 
if we are unable to retain and attract qualified personnel  we may be unable to effectively manage our business 
if we are unable to retain and motivate our existing employees and attract qualified personnel to fill key positions  we may be unable to effectively develop our existing products  make timely product introductions and increase sales 
since we generally do not have employment contracts with our employees  we must rely upon providing competitive compensation packages and a dynamic work environment to retain and motivate employees 
in response to the decline in our revenue and weakness in the telecommunications equipment market  we have not increased salaries for or paid bonuses to most of our employees since the end of fiscal since our compensation packages include equity based incentives  pressure on our stock price could affect our ability to continue to offer competitive compensation packages to our employees 
in addition to these compensation issues  we must continue to motivate employees to execute our strategies and achieve our goals  which may be difficult due to morale challenges posed by the workforce reductions and uncertainty in our industry and the economy in general 
if we lose members of our management team or other key personnel  it may be difficult to replace them 
even in the current economic downturn  competition for highly skilled technical and other personnel can be intense 
as a result  we may not be successful in identifying  recruiting and hiring qualified engineers and other key personnel 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers industry and economic conditions have weakened the financial position of some of our customers 
to sell to some of these customers  we may be required to take risks of uncollectible accounts 
while we monitor these situations carefully and attempt to take appropriate measures to protect ourselves  it is possible that we may have to write down or write off doubtful accounts 
such write downs or write offs  if large  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
our stock price is volatile our common stock price has experienced substantial volatility in the past  and is likely to remain volatile in the future 
volatility can arise as a result of divergence between our actual or anticipated financial results and published expectations of analysts  and announcements that we  our competitors  or our customers may make 
divergence between our actual results and our anticipated results  analyst estimates and public announcements by us  our competitors  or by customers will occur from time to time in the future  with resulting stock price volatility  irrespective of our overall year to year performance or long term prospects 
as long as we continue to depend on a limited customer base  and particularly when a substantial majority of their purchases consist of newly introduced products  there is substantial chance that our quarterly results will vary widely 
forward looking statements some of the statements contained  or incorporated by reference  in this annual report discuss future expectations  contain projections of results of operations or financial condition or state other forward looking information 
those statements are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements 
the forward looking information is based on various factors and was derived using numerous assumptions 
in some cases  you can identify these so called forward looking statements by words like may  will  should  expects  plans  anticipates  believes  estimates  predicts  potential or continue or the negative of those words and other comparable words 
you should be aware that those statements only reflect our predictions 
actual events or results may differ substantially 
important factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from the forward looking statements are disclosed throughout this report  particularly under the heading risk factors above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
the company maintains a short term and long term investment portfolio 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at october   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
foreign currency exchange risk 
as a global concern  the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and if our exposure increases  adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
the company s primary exposures are related to non dollar denominated operating expenses in canada  latin america  europe and asia where the company sells primarily in us dollars 
the company is prepared to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency if this exposure becomes material 
as of october   the assets and liabilities of the company related to non dollar denominated currencies were not material 
therefore we do not expect an increase or decrease of in the foreign exchange rate would have a material impact on the company s financial position
