we use words such as anticipates  believes  expects  future  intends and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements reflect management s current expectations and are inherently uncertain 
our actual results may differ significantly from management s expectations 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements regarding expectations of  among others  net sales  cost of products sold  pension costs  environmental costs and liquidity  all of which are inherently difficult to predict 
although we make such statements based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from our expectations 
accordingly  we identify the following important factors  among others  which could cause our results to differ from any results that might be projected  forecasted or estimated in any such forward looking statements i 
variations in demand for  or pricing of  our products  ii 
changes in the cost or availability of raw materials we use  in particular market pulp  pulp substitutes and wastepaper  abaca fiber  and changes in energy related costs  iii

critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial position and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales returns  doubtful accounts  inventories  investments and financial derivative instruments  long lived assets and contingencies  including environmental matters 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following represent the most significant and subjective estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
i 
we maintain reserves for expected sales returns and allowances based principally on our return practices and our historical experience 
if actual sales returns differ from the estimated return rates projected  we may need to increase or decrease our reserves for sales returns and allowances  which could affect our reported income 
ii 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers failure to make required payments 
if actual customer payments differ from our estimates  we may need to increase or decrease our allowances for doubtful accounts  which could affect our reported income 
iii 
we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets  including property  equipment and intangible assets periodically or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
our evaluations include analyses based on the cash flows generated by the underlying assets  profitability information  including estimated future operating results  trends or other determinants of fair value 
if the value of an asset determined by these evaluations is less than its carrying amount  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the related business may indicate an inability to recover the carrying value of the assets  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
iv 
accounting for defined benefit pension plans requires various assumptions  including  but not limited to  discount rates  expected rates of return on plan assets and future compensation growth rates 
accounting for our retiree medical plans also requires various assumptions  which include  but are not limited to  discount rates and annual rates of increase in the per capita costs of health care benefits 
we evaluate these assumptions at least once each year and make changes as conditions warrant 
changes to these assumptions will increase or decrease our reported income  which will result in changes to the recorded benefit plan assets and liabilities 
v 
we maintain accruals for losses associated with environmental obligations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing legislation and remediation technologies 
these accruals are adjusted periodically as assessment and remediation actions continue and or further legal or technical information develops 
such undiscounted liabilities are exclusive of any insurance or other claims against third parties 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties  including insurance carriers  are recorded as assets when their receipt is assured beyond a reasonable doubt 
vi 
we have made estimates and accrued for liabilities assumed by the buyers of the ecusta division 
in addition  we have recorded receivables due from the buyers to reimburse us for such liabilities as well as for other expenses we were to pay on the buyers behalf 
we continue to evaluate the collectibility of the receivables due from the buyers and  at december   have determined that no reserves are necessary for such receivables 
however  reserves may be necessary in future periods
