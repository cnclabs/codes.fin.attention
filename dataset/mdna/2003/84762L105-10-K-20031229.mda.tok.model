item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion of the financial results  liquidity  and other key items related to our performance 
this section should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in the financial statements section of this annual report on form k 
certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation 
all references to   and refer to fiscal year periods ended september    and  respectively 
introduction on october   we acquired substantially all of the consumer battery business of varta ag 
the acquisition consisted of the purchase of all of varta ag s consumer battery subsidiaries and business outside of germany  excluding brazil  and a controlling ownership and management interest in a new joint venture entity that will operate the varta ag consumer battery business in germany 
the residual interest in the joint venture is held by varta ag 
with the acquisition of varta  we became a truly global battery manufacturer and marketer and acquired additional low cost manufacturing capacity and battery technology 
in addition  on september   we acquired all of the equity interests of remington products company  llc remington is a leading consumer products company focusing on the development and marketing of personal care products 
remington designs and distributes electric shavers and accessories  grooming products  hair care appliances and other small electrical consumer products 
the acquisition of remington allowed us to become a diversified consumer products company no longer solely focused on the battery and lighting product markets 
remington was attractive due to its position as a strong branded company  its new product pipeline and its use of distribution channels similar to those employed by rayovac in the united states 
following the acquisitions of varta and remington  we are a global branded consumer products company with leading market positions in our two major product categories consumer batteries and electric personal care products 
we are a leading worldwide manufacturer and marketer of alkaline and zinc carbon batteries 
we are also the leading worldwide manufacturer and marketer of hearing aid batteries  a leading worldwide designer and marketer of rechargeable batteries and a leading marketer of battery powered lighting products 
with the acquisition of remington  we are also a leading designer and marketer of electric shavers and accessories  electric grooming products and hair care appliances 
our products are sold on a global basis in over countries through a variety of channels  including mass merchandisers  home centers and hardware stores  consumer electronics stores  warehouse clubs  food  drug and convenience stores  department stores  hearing aid professionals  industrial distributors and original equipment manufacturers oems 
we enjoy strong name recognition in our markets under the rayovac  varta and remington brands  each of which has been in existence for more than years 
our financial performance is influenced by a number of factors including general economic conditions and trends in consumer markets  our overall product line mix  including sales prices and gross margins which vary by product line  and our general competitive position  especially as impacted by our competitors promotional activities and pricing strategies 
these influencing factors played significant roles in our financial results during fiscal  and we manage our business based upon three geographic regions 
the regions are as follows north america  which includes the united states and canada  latin america  which includes mexico  central america  south america and the caribbean  and europe rest of world europe row  which includes continental europe  the united kingdom  and all other countries in which we do business 
our consolidated results of operations for the twelve months ended september  do not include the impacts of the remington acquisition  as the transaction occurred on the close of business on september  our consolidated balance sheet  as of september   and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended do incorporate the impacts of the remington transaction 
cost reduction initiatives we continually seek to improve our operational efficiencies  match our manufacturing capacity and product costs to market demand and better utilize our manufacturing resources 
since the beginning of fiscal  we have undertaken various initiatives to reduce manufacturing  operating and other costs 
we believe that we can continue to drive down our cost of goods manufactured with continued focus on cost reduction initiatives 
fiscal in fiscal  we closed our wonewoc  wisconsin plant and now source lighting products previously made at this plant from third party suppliers 
with this closure  we now outsource all of our lighting products 
in addition  we outsourced certain manufacturing operations at our fennimore  wisconsin plant to accommodate the installation of a new high speed aa size alkaline battery line and discontinued inefficient packaging operations 
also in fiscal  we closed our zinc carbon battery plants in tegucigalpa  honduras and rationalized our manufacturing and distribution processes in our mexico city  mexico manufacturing facilities and in our european operations by discontinuing or outsourcing uneconomic product lines or production processes  including the outsourcing of zinc carbon rod manufacturing  and by changing uneconomical modes of distribution 
finally  in fiscal  we engaged in an organizational restructuring in north america and latin america 
as part of this initiative  sales and marketing functions were eliminated and or consolidated 
these cost reduction initiatives reduced our global workforce by approximately employees 
fiscal in fiscal  we closed our santo domingo  dominican republic manufacturing facility and transferred production of zinc carbon batteries to our guatemala city  guatemala manufacturing facility 
we also outsourced a portion of our zinc carbon battery production previously manufactured at our mexico city  mexico facility 
the impact of the fiscal and fiscal cost reduction initiatives on our operations is described below under the heading fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  restructuring and related charges 
fiscal in october  in conjunction with the acquisition of the varta consumer battery business described above  we announced a series of initiatives designed to position our consumer battery business for future growth opportunities and to optimize the combined global resources of rayovac and varta 
these initiatives  which are expected to provide significant benefits to the combined organization  include the renegotiation of certain sourcing arrangements  the elimination of duplicate costs in our consumer battery business and the consolidation of sales and marketing functions 
in october  we closed our mexico city  mexico manufacturing facility 
with the closure of the mexico city  mexico plant  the plants in guatemala city  guatemala  breitenbach  france  and manizales  colombia became our remaining zinc carbon manufacturing plants 
the consolidation of our zinc carbon capacity within latin america is consistent with the global market trend away from zinc carbon toward alkaline batteries  and is intended to allow us to more closely match our manufacturing capacity to anticipated market demands 
we also announced the closure of operations at our madison  wisconsin packaging center and middleton  wisconsin distribution center in october these facilities were closed during fiscal and their operations were combined into a new leased complex in dixon  illinois 
transition to the new facility was completed in june we anticipate that the relocation to the new leased packaging and distribution center will result in operational changes that are intended to reduce freight and inventory handling costs 
we expect that all geographies will benefit from decreased costs and expenses resulting from the varta initiatives 
these initiatives are anticipated to create long term opportunities for procurement savings resulting from renegotiated raw material and finished good sourcing arrangements and lower operating costs as duplicative administrative support and sales and marketing functions are consolidated and overlapping functions are eliminated 
the benefits of the varta initiatives are expected to positively impact future gross profit and operating margins  but were partially offset during fiscal and in the near term by exit and integration costs  including employee termination benefits and asset impairments associated with the elimination of duplicative functions  an increase in interest expense associated with the acquisition  and increased exposure to foreign currency movements reflecting our expanded global presence 
in addition  the acquisition of the varta consumer battery business is expected to negatively impact our effective tax rate  as we estimate a larger percentage of our income will be generated in higher tax jurisdictions 
annual savings associated with the varta initiatives are projected to be in the range of million when fully realized by the end of fiscal costs associated with certain cost reduction initiatives are discussed in note  restructuring and related charges  to our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the impact of the fiscal cost reduction initiatives on our operations is described below under the heading fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  restructuring and related charges 
in conjunction with the acquisition of the remington business  we identified annual savings opportunities of approximately million when fully realized  which we currently expect by these savings are primarily related to purchasing  supply chain management  manufacturing and back office functions 
we estimate we will incur total costs cash and non cash of approximately million over the next two years to achieve these savings 
integration activities are currently underway and savings and cost estimates will be further refined during fiscal we expect the north america and europe row geographies to benefit from decreased costs and expenses resulting from these remington initiatives to optimize the combined resources of rayovac and remington 
meeting consumer needs through technology and development we continue to focus our efforts on meeting consumer needs for portable power  personal care  and lighting products through new product development and technology innovations 
prior to the remington acquisition  we announced improvements and new developments in our rechargeable  alkaline  hearing aid  and lighting products product lines 
during fiscal  we introduced a one hour charger for nickel metal hydride nimh batteries  and began selling higher performing nimh batteries 
in fiscal  we announced the development of a revolutionary rechargeable nimh battery system capable of recharging batteries in as little as minutes which was introduced in the retail market during fiscal these technological advancements provide consumers with portable  rechargeable power as the use of digital cameras and other high drain devices continues to grow 
in fiscal  we launched our new  more powerful rayovac maximum plus alkaline batteries  with bold new graphics 
also during fiscal and fiscal  we increased the performance of our hearing aid batteries  and launched innovative packaging allowing consumers to more easily dispense the hearing aid batteries 
in europe during fiscal  we launched our high energy alkaline batteries and upgraded our graphic designs for our maxitech and longlife batteries  all marketed under the varta brand name 
finally  we rejuvenated our lighting products product line through a series of new product launches designed to reach unique markets within the mass and retail channels 
during fiscal  we introduced to the united states marketplace a comprehensive pricing strategy for our alkaline battery product portfolio 
we simplified the battery buying decision process for consumers by offering fifty percent more of our aa and aaa batteries for the same price as the competition 
we believe this fifty percent more strategy will help redefine the value position of our maximum plus alkaline products 
this strategy will also match up with the consumer trend of buying larger pack size of batteries 
research and development efforts at remington allow us to maintain our unique manufacturing process in cutting systems for shavers 
remington is continuously pursuing new innovations for its line of shavers including foil improvements and new cutting and trimmer configurations 
remington also devotes resources to the development of new technologies for its other products 
during fiscal and prior to the acquisition  remington introduced the remington titanium line of men s microscreen and microflex shavers  a line of personal grooming products that utilize titanium coated blades and trimmers 
we believe that our products are well poised to meet the portable power  lighting and electric personal care needs of consumers 
we will continue to focus on identifying new technologies necessary to meet consumer and retailer needs within the marketplace 
competitive landscape the alkaline battery business is highly competitive on a global scale 
within north america  europe and latin america  there are four primary branded providers of alkaline batteries and a few local manufacturers within each geographic region 
the alkaline marketplace has seen changes in recent years related to product line segmentation  with attempts to segment the category into high performance  regular and value positions  combined with the introduction of private label batteries at certain retailers 
in addition  market participants continue to engage in high levels of promotional and pricing activities to gain market share 
in the united states in  duracell  one of our competitors  announced they were lowering the prices of their alkaline batteries 
this action  in conjunction with our and energizer s responses  is expected to have a short term impact on the overall united states battery category growth 
within latin america  poor economic conditions have dramatically impacted battery sales especially within the zinc carbon product line 
zinc carbon batteries continue to be the largest share of the battery market in latin america in unit terms 
in north america and europe  the majority of consumers purchase alkaline batteries 
within north america and europe  the rechargeable battery business has experienced dramatic changes over the past three years 
primary rechargeable alkaline sales have declined over this period with a shift towards rechargeable batteries  such as nimh  which are higher performing in high drain devices 
our development of a one hour charger and an innovative minute rechargeable battery technology help us maintain the number one market position within the rechargeable category in the united states  as estimated by management 
within the hearing aid battery category  we continue to hold the number one global market position based on management estimates 
we believe that our close relationship with hearing aid manufacturers and other customers  as well as our product performance improvements and packaging innovations  position us for continued success in this category 
seasonal product sales our quarterly results are impacted by our seasonal sales 
sales during the first and fourth fiscal quarters of the year are generally higher than other quarters due to the impact of the december holiday season 
the seasonality of our sales during the last three fiscal years is as follows percentage of annual sales fiscal year ended september  fiscal quarter ended december march june september remington also experiences seasonal sales 
during calendar  remington s sales for the quarters ended march  june  september  and december were    and  respectively 
we anticipate our sales for the fiscal quarter ending in december will be a larger portion of our annual sales going forward 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  highlights of consolidated operating results year over year historical comparisons are influenced by our october  acquisition of substantially all of the consumer battery business of varta ag  which is included in our current year but not prior year results 
see note  acquisitions and divestitures  of notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the varta acquisition 
the acquisition of remington  had no effect on fiscal operating results  as the transaction was completed after the close of business on september  net sales 
our net sales increased million to million in fiscal from million the previous year 
the sales increase is attributable to the varta acquisition partially offset by sales decreases in the north america segment 
operating income 
our income from operations decreased million to million in fiscal from million the previous year 
the decrease was primarily attributable to million in restructuring charges reflecting a series of restructuring initiatives announced and implemented during fiscal and a million decrease in north america segment profitability discussed below 
these decreases were mostly offset by the profitability associated with the varta acquisition 
for further discussion of restructuring and related charges see note  restructuring and related charges  of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
net income 
our net income in fiscal decreased million to million from million the previous year 
the decrease was due to restructuring and related charges of million  after tax  an increase in interest expense of million  after tax  north america retailer markdown programs of million  after tax  non operating expense of million  after tax  reflecting the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the replacement of our previous credit facility  and the decline in north america profitability  partially offset by the profitability of the varta acquisition 
fiscal includes a million  after tax  net bad debt expense related to the bankruptcy filing of a north america segment customer 
segment results 
we evaluate segment profitability based on income from operations before corporate expense and restructuring and related charges 
corporate expense includes corporate purchasing expense  general and administrative expense  and certain research and development expenses 
europe row net sales from external customers segment profit segment profit as a of net sales assets the europe row segment was the segment most dramatically impacted by the varta acquisition 
increases in sales  segment profitability and assets all reflect the significance of varta within the region and the favorable impact of foreign currency movements 
intense sales  marketing  operational and administrative integration activities were implemented and substantially completed within the region making identification of factors causing year over year variation difficult 
profitability as a percent of net sales increased to in fiscal from in the previous year primarily reflecting the impact of the varta acquisition and improved gross profit margins 
intangible assets of million  primarily related to the varta acquisition  now make up a substantial portion of the asset base within the segment 
the segment s asset base as of september   includes the international operations of remington 
north america net sales from external customers segment profit segment profit as a of net sales assets our sales to external customers decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million the previous year due primarily to weakness in alkaline  zinc carbon  and rechargeable product line sales 
alkaline sales decreases of million were caused by intense competitive promotional pricing activity in this battery category  a million decline in post bankruptcy sales to a customer  approximately million in retailer markdown programs associated with the company s new alkaline pricing program  and our inability to replace million in sales to a discontinued low margin oem customer in the prior year 
zinc carbon sales decreased million compared to last year due to reduced distribution and general marketplace trends away from the use of this type of battery 
rechargeable battery sales also decreased million compared to last year due to lower sales in advance of the i c rechargeable battery system launched in the fourth quarter of fiscal hearing aid battery sales increased million  or due to overall category strength 
our profitability decreased million to million from million the previous year 
the decrease in profitability was primarily attributable to lower gross profit due to the current year sales decrease partially offset by a million net bad debt expense related to the bankruptcy filing of a key customer recorded in the prior year 
due to the reasons mentioned above  our profitability margins decreased basis points to from the previous year 
our assets increased to million from million the previous year primarily reflecting the impacts of the remington acquisition and intangible assets of approximately million attributable to the transaction 
the purchase price allocation for the remington acquisition is not yet final 
latin america net sales from external customers segment profit segment profit as a of net sales assets our sales to external customers increased million  or to million in fiscal from million the previous year 
the increase in sales is due to the impact of the varta acquisition and sales increases within central america of million primarily reflecting improvements in our wholesaler and distributor channels 
these increases were partially offset by currency devaluations in the dominican republic contributing to a sales decrease of million  declines caused by unfavorable economic conditions and political uncertainties in venezuela resulting in a sales decline of million  and the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency movements impacting other geographies within the region 
our profitability increased million to million and was primarily the result of the varta acquisition  improved profitability in central america partially offset by profit declines in venezuela and dominican republic 
our assets increased million  or  to million from million the previous year 
the acquisition of the varta business in latin america resulted in asset increases across all asset categories  except for a reduction in accounts receivable reflecting improvements in collections  a decrease in property  plant and equipment reflecting the closure of the mexico manufacturing facility 
the closure and subsequent write off of the mexico manufacturing related assets are included in restructuring and related charges in our consolidated statement of operations see note  restructuring and related charges  of notes to the consolidated financial statements and are not included in our latin america segment results 
the remington acquisition had no effect on latin america segment assets

the closure of the dominican republic manufacturing facility and outsourcing of mexico zinc carbon production  in fiscal  resulted in million of employee termination benefits for approximately manufacturing employees  million of charges from the abandonment of equipment and inventory  net of a change in estimate of million  associated with the closing of the manufacturing facility and million of other expenses 
the change in estimate reflected our ability to utilize more inventory and manufacturing equipment at our guatemala city  guatemala manufacturing location than originally anticipated 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million in fiscal due to the increase in debt to finance the varta acquisition 
non operating expense 
in fiscal  we recorded non operating expense of million relating to the write off of unamortized debt fees associated with our previous credit facility  replaced in conjunction with the varta acquisition 
there was no non operating expense in fiscal other income expense 
other income expense  net  improved million to income of million in fiscal  primarily attributable to foreign exchange transaction gains 
income tax expense 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal  a decrease from during the previous year 
the decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year primarily reflects the net impact of certain tax credits realized during fiscal  favorable adjustments to prior year deferred taxes  adjustments to prior year tax reserves reflecting the expiration of certain statute of limitations  partially offset by non deductible interest expense associated with our acquisition of varta 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  highlights of consolidated operating results net sales 
our net sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million the previous year 
increases in hearing aid battery and lighting product sales were unable to offset declines in zinc carbon and alkaline sales 
income from operations 
our income from operations increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million the previous year 
this increase was primarily due to reduction in restructuring charges of million offset by a million bad debt reserve  net of recoveries  resulting from the bankruptcy filing of a key customer 
net income 
our net income for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million the previous year 
the increase reflects a reduction in interest expense attributable to the retirement of million of senior subordinated notes following our june common stock offering  plus a million reduction in debt during fiscal due to strong cash flow from operations 
in addition  fiscal results reflect a million pretax restructuring charge and an million pretax non operating expense 
these improvements were partially offset by a bad debt reserve of million  net of tax  recognized in fiscal related to the bankruptcy filing of a key customer 
north america net sales from external customers segment profit segment profit as a of net sales our revenue from external customers decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million the previous year 
zinc carbon sales decreases of million reflect the trend in the industry toward alkaline and the discontinuation of certain products at selected stores of a major retailer 
alkaline sales decreases of million were attributable to the decline in sales to a key customer in bankruptcy  a cautious retail inventory environment and continued promotional activity  and our inability to replace sales to an oem customer in the previous year 
increases in lighting products of million resulted from new product launches and distribution gains 
our profitability increased million to million in fiscal from million the previous year 
this increase was primarily attributable to the benefits of the plant closures and organizational restructurings as more fully described under the heading cost reduction initiatives  that lowered operating expenses and improved gross profit margins 
this was partially offset by a million bad debt reserve  net of recoveries  resulting from the bankruptcy filing of a north america segment customer 
latin america net sales from external customers segment profit segment profit as a of net sales our revenue from external customers decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million the previous year due primarily to decreased sales of zinc carbon batteries 
net sales were impacted by unfavorable economic conditions in mexico  argentina  and venezuela  primarily due to general weakened market conditions 
also impacting net sales were curtailments of shipments to certain distributors and wholesalers who were delinquent on payments  general political uncertainties and instability in argentina and venezuela  and the unfavorable impacts of currency devaluation which contributed approximately million of the sales decline versus fiscal we have a business presence in approximately countries throughout the world  all of which are subject to varying degrees of political and economic risk 
in fiscal  changes in the economic and political environments in mexico  argentina and venezuela subjected us to varying degrees of political and economic risks 
while these markets collectively represent approximately and of our latin america segment revenue and total assets  respectively  they collectively represent approximately and of our consolidated revenue and total assets  respectively 
in spite of the sales decline  the segment remained profitable  with profit of million in fiscal however  this was a decrease of million from the previous year 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the impact of the sales decline  partially offset by lower advertising expenses and a reduction in other operating expenses in the region 
as of october   we adopted fasb statement no 
and were no longer required to amortize goodwill and certain intangibles with indefinite lives 
this resulted in a reduction of amortization expense of million  within the segment  for the year 
segment profit margins decreased primarily due to an unfavorable customer mix compounded by relatively fixed operating expenses spread over lower sales 
europe row net sales from external customers segment profit segment profit as a of net sales our revenue from external customers increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million the previous year  primarily reflecting increased sales of alkaline and hearing aid batteries  and favorable impacts of foreign currency movements 
our profitability increased million  or  due primarily to sales gains and a reduction in operating expenses due to the cost reduction initiatives described above under the heading cost reduction initiatives fiscal and the adoption of fasb statement no 
 which resulted in lower amortization expense 
corporate expenses 
our corporate expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million the previous year 
the increase was primarily due to higher legal expenses  technology spending  and compensation expense 
restructuring and related charges 
in fiscal  we recorded net restructuring and related charges of million related to i the closure of our manufacturing facility in santo domingo  dominican republic and transfer of production to our guatemala city  guatemala manufacturing facility and the outsourcing of a portion of our zinc carbon battery production previously manufactured at our mexico city  mexico manufacturing facility  as more fully described above under the heading cost reduction initiatives fiscal and ii the reversal of million of expenses related to the december restructuring announcement which were not realized  primarily reflecting a change in estimated termination benefits of million  due to lower estimates of outplacement costs and costs attributable to fringe benefits  and the retention of selected employees 
the closure of the dominican republic manufacturing facility and outsourcing of mexico zinc carbon production resulted in million of employee termination benefits for approximately manufacturing employees  million of charges from the abandonment of equipment and inventory  net of a change in estimate of million  associated with the closing of the manufacturing facility and million of other expenses 
the change in estimate reflected our ability to utilize more inventory and manufacturing equipment at our guatemala city  guatemala manufacturing location than originally anticipated 
the cost reduction initiatives undertaken in fiscal and described above are complete as of september  the remaining accrued termination benefits were paid before december we believe cost reduction initiatives generated annual savings approximating the cash costs of the restructuring initiatives 
we recorded restructuring and related charges of million in fiscal  reflecting million of employee termination benefits for approximately employees  million of equipment  inventory  and other asset write offs and million of other expenses associated with the cost reduction initiatives described above under the heading cost reduction initiatives fiscal  including i an organizational restructuring in the us  ii the closure of the tegucigalpa  honduras facility and the rationalization of our manufacturing and distribution processes in our tegucigalpa  honduras and mexico city  mexico manufacturing facilities and in our european operations  iii the closure of our wonewoc  wisconsin manufacturing facility and iv the rationalization of inefficient manufacturing processes  packaging operations and product lines at our fennimore  wisconsin manufacturing facility and madison  wisconsin packaging location 
in addition  restructuring and related charges also reflected costs associated with our june common stock offering 
the cost reduction initiatives undertaken in fiscal are complete and we do not anticipate any further material charges to result from such initiatives 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in the previous year primarily due to the retirement of million of senior subordinated notes in june using proceeds from our common stock offering and the repayment of million in debt from our strong cash flow from operations 
non operating expense 
in fiscal  we recorded non operating expense of million resulting from the premium on the repurchase of million of senior subordinated notes and the related write off of unamortized debt issuance costs 
income tax expense 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the higher rate for fiscal primarily reflects a change in geographic profitability away from lower tax jurisdictions  primarily within latin america  and proportionately higher income in the united states 
liquidity and capital resources for fiscal  operating activities provided million in net cash  an increase of million over the previous year 
within operating cash flow  we recognized lower net income of million reflecting the impacts of the fiscal restructuring activities partially offset by the impacts of the varta acquisition 
we also experienced an increase in other non cash adjustments primarily reflecting non cash restructuring charges of million  depreciation expense of million primarily reflecting the impacts of the varta acquisition  the write off of the unamortized debt issuance costs of million  and amortization of unearned restricted stock compensation of million partially offset by increases in deferred taxes of million 
operating cash flow from changes in working capital was essentially unchanged from the previous year 
net cash used by investing activities increased to million for fiscal  primarily reflecting payments associated with the varta and remington acquisitions  net of cash acquired  of million 
capital expenditures of million were primarily for improvements to alkaline battery manufacturing and leasehold improvements on the dixon  illinois leased packaging and distribution center 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately million  which are expected to include spending for continued investment in our alkaline and hearing aid manufacturing operations  continued technology investments  and spending associated with our recent remington acquisition 
during fiscal we granted approximately million options to purchase shares of common stock to various employees of the company 
all grants have been at an exercise price equal to the market price of the common stock on the date of the grant 
we also granted approximately million shares of restricted stock on october   from the incentive plan  to certain members of management 
the majority of these shares will vest on september   with the remainder vesting on september   provided the recipient is still employed by us 
the total market value of the restricted shares on date of grant totaled approximately million and has been recorded as unearned restricted stock compensation as a separate component of shareholders equity 
unearned compensation is being amortized to expense over the vesting period 
during fiscal  restricted shares with a value of approximately million on the grant date were forfeited 
the third amended and restated credit agreement third restated agreement  undertaken to acquire substantially all of the consumer battery business of varta ag  and subsequently amended on january  first amendment  required  among other provisions  that the recording and incurrence of restructuring charges meet certain definitions and time constraints to qualify as additions in calculating adjusted ebitda  as defined  that we were to transform the german subsidiary acquired from varta ag from a gmbh legal structure to a kgaa legal structure the transformation on or before june   and that we obtain consent of the required lenders to effect releases or substitutions of collateral pledges 
effective june   the third restated agreement was amended second amendment i to re define and permit acceleration  recording  and incurrence of certain restructuring charges  as defined in the third restated agreement  ii to extend the deadline for the transformation to on or before march   and iii to consent to certain organizational restructurings restructurings  including releases and substitutions of collateral pledges  and disregarding application of certain basket amounts as necessary to effect the restructurings

we believe our cash flow from operating activities and periodic borrowings under our credit facilities will be adequate to meet the short term and long term liquidity requirements of our existing business prior to the expiration of those credit facilities  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
our current senior secured credit facilities include a revolving credit facility of million  a revolving credit facility of million  a term loan of million  a term loan of million and a term loan of million 
as of september   the following amounts were outstanding under the senior secured facilities million of the term loan and  million and million  respectively  of the euro term loans 
approximately million of the availability under the us dollar revolver was utilized for outstanding letters of credit 
as of september   our senior subordinated debt issued and outstanding includes million of notes issued by rayovac and million of notes issued by remington the remington notes 
the remington notes were called for redemption  effective september   and redeemed effective october   and consequently were reflected as current obligations at september  as of september   we were in compliance with the provisions of our senior loan covenants and respective subordinated debt indentures 
we believe our future results from operations will be adequate to maintain compliance with such provisions although no assurance can be given in this regard 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources that are material to investors 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and fairly present our financial position and results of operations 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to an understanding of our financial statements 
the application of these policies requires management judgment and estimates in areas that are inherently uncertain 
valuation of assets and asset impairment we evaluate certain long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  and certain intangibles for impairment based on the expected future cash flows or earnings projections 
an asset s value is deemed impaired if the discounted cash flows or earnings projections generated do not substantiate the carrying value of the asset 
the estimation of such amounts requires management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates  changes in working capital  and selection of an appropriate discount rate  as applicable 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease discounted future operating cash flows or earnings projections and could  therefore  change impairment determination 
we adopted fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective october  fasb statement no 
requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives not be amortized  and that impairment of such assets be evaluated as discussed above at least annually 
we evaluate deferred tax assets based on future earnings projections 
an asset s value is deemed impaired if the earnings projections do not substantiate the carrying value of the asset 
the estimation of such amounts requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates  changes in working capital  and other assumptions  as applicable 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease future earnings projections and could  therefore  change the determination of whether an asset is realizable 
see note h  note i  note x  note  note  and note to the consolidated financial statements for more information about these assets 
revenue recognition and concentration of credit risk we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to the customer  which is the point at which all risks and rewards of ownership of the product are passed  provided that there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is deemed reasonably assured 
we are generally not obligated to allow for  and our general policy is not to accept  product returns 
we enter into various promotional arrangements  primarily with retail customers  including arrangements entitling such retailers to cash rebates from us based on the level of their purchases  which require us to estimate and accrue the estimated costs of the promotional programs 
these costs are generally treated as a reduction of net sales 
we also enter into promotional arrangements targeted to the consumer 
such arrangements are treated as either a reduction of net sales or an increase in cost of sales  based on the type of promotional program 
the income statement characterization of our promotional arrangements complies with eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
cash consideration  or an equivalent thereto  given to a customer is generally classified as a reduction of net sales 
if we provide a customer anything other than cash  the cost of the consideration is classified as an expense and included in cost of sales 
for all types of promotional arrangements and programs  we monitor our commitments and use statistical measures and past experience to determine the amounts to be recorded for the estimate of the earned  but unpaid  promotional costs 
the terms of our customer related promotional arrangements and programs are individualized to each customer and are generally documented through written contracts  correspondence or other communications with the individual customers 
we also enter into various contractual arrangements  primarily with retail customers  which require us to make an upfront cash  or slotting payment  to secure the right to distribute through such customer 
we capitalize slotting payments  provided the payments are supported by a time or volume based contractual arrangement with the retailer  and will amortize the associated payment over the appropriate time or volume based term of the contractual arrangement 
the amortization of the slotting payment is treated as a reduction in net sales and the corresponding asset is included in deferred charges and other in our consolidated balance sheets 
our trade receivables subject us to credit risk which is evaluated based on changing economic  political  and specific customer conditions 
we assess these risks and make provisions for collectibility based on our best estimate of the risks presented and information available at the date of the financial statements 
the use of different assumptions may change the estimate of collectibility 
we extend credit to our customers based upon an evaluation of the customer s financial condition and credit history and generally do not require collateral 
our credit terms generally range between and days from invoice date  depending upon the evaluation of the customer s financial condition and history 
we monitor our customers credit and financial conditions based on changing economic conditions and adjust our credit policies with respect to any individual customer as we determine appropriate 
these adjustments may include  but are not limited to  restricting shipments to customers  reducing credit limits  shortening credit terms  requiring cash payments in advance of shipment  or securing credit insurance 
our adjustments to our credit policies may not be effective in reducing our credit risk associated with any particular customer 
in  we experienced a significant loss resulting from the bankruptcy filing of a large retailer in the united states to which we had extended credit in accordance with our credit policy 
in the future  we may experience additional losses due to changing economic  political and specific customer conditions that may adversely affect collectibility of trade receivables 
see notes b  c  and e to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our revenue recognition and credit policies 
pensions our accounting for pension benefits is primarily based on discount rate  expected and actual return on plan assets  and other assumptions made by management  and is impacted by outside factors such as equity and fixed income market performance 
pension liability is principally the estimated present value of future benefits  net of plan assets 
in calculating the estimated present value of future benefits  net of plan assets  for and  we used a discount rate of and to  respectively 
in lowering the discount rate from to  we considered the change in the general market interest rates of debt rated aaa or aa by moody s investors service from june to june and solicited the advice of its independent actuary 
we believe the discount rate used is reflective of the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
the decrease in our discount rate in fiscal contributed to an increase in our projected benefit obligation from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal pension expense is principally the sum of interest and service cost of the plan  less the expected return on plan assets and the amortization of the difference between our assumptions and actual experience 
the expected return on plan assets is calculated by applying an assumed rate of return to the fair value of plan assets 
in and  we used an expected return on plan assets of and to  respectively 
based on the advice of our independent actuary  we believe the expected rate of return is reflective of the long term average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested 
an increase in the expected return on plan assets used by us would have the effect of decreasing future pension expense 
if such expected return were overstated  it would ultimately increase future pension expense 
similarly  an understatement of the expected return would ultimately decrease future pension expense 
if plan assets decline due to poor performance by the markets and or interest rate declines our pension liability would increase  ultimately increasing future pension expense 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of our employee benefit plans 
restructuring restructuring liabilities are recorded for estimated costs of facility closures  significant organizational adjustments  and measures undertaken by management to exit certain activities 
costs for such activities are estimated by management after evaluating detailed analyses of the cost to be incurred 
such liabilities could include amounts for items such as severance costs and related benefits including settlements of pension plans  impairment of property and equipment and other current or long term assets  lease termination payments  plus any other items directly related to the exit activities 
while the actions are carried out as expeditiously as possible  restructuring charges are estimates 
changes in estimates resulting in an increase to or a reversal of a previously recorded liability  may be required as management executes the restructuring plan 
during fiscal  we adopted the requirements of fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which impacts the timing of recognition of certain exit or disposal costs 
we report restructuring charges relating to manufacturing and related initiatives in cost of goods sold 
restructuring and related charges reflected in cost of goods sold include  but are not limited to  termination and related costs associated with manufacturing employees  asset impairments relating to manufacturing initiatives  and other costs directly related to the restructuring initiatives implemented 
we report restructuring charges relating to administrative functions in operating expenses  such as  initiatives impacting sales  marketing  distribution  or other non manufacturing related functions 
restructuring and related charges reflected in operating expenses include  but are not limited to  termination and related costs  any asset impairments relating to the functional area described above  and other costs directly related to the initiatives implemented 
see note x and note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of recent restructuring initiatives and related costs 
loss contingencies loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the outcome of existing litigation and the impact of environmental matters are examples of situations evaluated as loss contingencies 
estimating the probability and magnitude of losses is often dependent upon management s judgment of potential actions by third parties and regulators 
it is possible that changes in estimates or an increased probability of an unfavorable outcome could materially affect future results of operations 
see further discussion in item  legal proceedings  and note to the consolidated financial statements 
other significant accounting policies other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed above  are also critical to understanding the consolidated financial statements 
notes to the consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk factors we have market risk exposure from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we use derivative financial instruments for purposes other than trading to mitigate the risk from such exposures 
interest rate risk we have bank lines of credit at variable interest rates 
the general level of us interest rates  libor  and euro libor primarily affects interest expense 
we use interest rate swaps to manage such risk 
the net amounts to be paid or received under interest rate swap agreements are accrued as interest rates change  and are recognized over the life of the swap agreements  as an adjustment to interest expense from the underlying debt to which the swap is designated 
the related amounts payable to  or receivable from  the contract counter parties are included in accrued liabilities or accounts receivable 
foreign exchange risk we are subject to risk from sales and loans to and from our subsidiaries as well as sales to  purchases from and bank lines of credit with  third party customers  suppliers and creditors  respectively  denominated in foreign currencies 
foreign currency sales are made primarily in euros  pounds sterling  colombian pesos  and mexican pesos 
foreign currency purchases are made primarily in euros  pounds sterling  guatemalan quetzals  colombian pesos  and mexican pesos 
we also have foreign currency sales and purchases in other currencies throughout the world 
we manage our foreign exchange exposure from anticipated sales  accounts receivable  inter company loans  firm purchase commitments and credit obligations through the use of naturally occurring offsetting positions borrowing in local currency  forward foreign exchange contracts  foreign exchange rate swaps and foreign exchange options 
the related amounts payable to  or receivable from  the contract counter parties are included in accounts payable or accounts receivable 
commodity price risk we are exposed to fluctuations in market prices for purchases of zinc used in the manufacturing process 
we use commodity swaps  calls and puts to manage such risk 
the maturity of  and the quantities covered by  the contracts are closely correlated to our anticipated purchases of the commodities 
the cost of calls  and the premiums received from the puts  are amortized over the life of the contracts and are recorded in cost of goods sold  along with the effects of the swap  put and call contracts 
the related amounts payable to  or receivable from  the counterparties are included in accounts payable or accounts receivable 
sensitivity analysis the analysis below is hypothetical and should not be considered a projection of future risks 
earnings projections are before tax 
as of september   the potential change in fair value of outstanding interest rate derivative instruments  assuming a unfavorable shift in the underlying interest rates would be a loss of million 
the net impact on reported earnings  after also including the reduction in one year s interest expense on the related debt due to the same shift in interest rates  would be a net loss of million 
as of september   the potential change in fair value of outstanding foreign exchange derivative instruments  assuming a unfavorable shift in the underlying foreign exchange rates would be a loss of million 
the net impact on future cash flows  after also including the gain in value on the related accounts receivable and accounts payable outstanding at september  due to the same change in exchange rates  would be zero 
as of september   the potential change in fair value of outstanding commodity price derivative instruments  assuming a unfavorable change in the underlying commodity prices would be a loss of million 
the net impact on reported earnings  after also including the reduction in cost of one year s purchases of the related commodities due to the same change in commodity prices  would be a net gain of million 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in note r to the consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements we have made or implied certain forward looking statements in this annual report on form k 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this annual report  including the statements under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business  regarding our business strategy  future operations  financial position  estimated revenues  projected costs  projected synergies  prospects  plans and objectives of management  as well as information concerning expected actions of third parties  are forward looking statements 
when used in this annual report  the words anticipate  intend  plan  estimate  believe  expect  project  could  will  should  may and similar expressions are also intended to identify forward looking statements  although not all forward looking statements contain such identifying words 
since these forward looking statements are based upon current expectations of future events and projections and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control  actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those expressed or implied herein  and you should not place undue reliance on these statements 
important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied herein include  without limitation competitive promotional activity or spending by competitors or price reductions by competitors  the loss of  or a significant reduction in  sales to a significant retail customer  difficulties or delays in the integration of operations of acquired businesses  the introduction of new product features or technological developments by competitors and or the development of new competitors or competitive brands  the effects of general economic conditions  including inflation  labor costs and stock market volatility or changes in trade  monetary or fiscal policies in the countries where we do business  our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and protect our intellectual property  our ability to successfully implement  achieve and sustain manufacturing and distribution cost efficiencies and improvements  and fully realize anticipated cost savings  the impact of unusual items resulting from the implementation of new business strategies  acquisitions and divestitures or current and proposed restructuring activities  the cost and effect of unanticipated legal  tax or regulatory proceedings or new laws or regulations including environmental regulations  changes in accounting policies applicable to our business  interest rate  exchange rate and raw materials price fluctuations  and the effects of political or economic conditions or unrest in international markets 
some of the above mentioned factors are described in further detail in risk factors beginning on page you should assume the information appearing in this annual report is accurate only as of september  or as otherwise specified  as our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects may have changed since that date 
except as required by applicable law  including the securities laws of the united states and the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission  we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions affecting such forward looking statement 
risk factors any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations and the risks described below are not the only risks that we may face 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we participate in very competitive markets and we may not be able to compete successfully 
the consumer battery and electric personal care product markets in which we participate are very competitive 
in the consumer battery market  our primary competitors are duracell a brand of gillette  energizer and panasonic a brand of matsushita 
in the electric personal care products market  our primary competitors are braun a brand of gillette and philips norelco 
we and our competitors compete for consumer acceptance and limited shelf space based upon brand name recognition  perceived quality  price  performance  product packaging and design innovation  as well as creative marketing  promotion and distribution strategies 
for example  in response to duracell lowering its prices  we are currently introducing a comprehensive pricing strategy for our alkaline product portfolio in the us there can be no assurance that such program will achieve our objectives 
our ability to compete in these consumer product markets may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the following our primary competitors in both the battery markets and electric personal care product markets are well established companies that have substantially greater financial and other resources and greater overall market share than we do 
in some key product lines  our competitors may have lower production costs and higher profit margins than we do  which may enable them to compete more aggressively in offering retail discounts and other promotional incentives 
product improvements or effective advertising campaigns by competitors may weaken consumer demand for our products 
consumer preferences may change to products other than those we market 
consolidation of retailers and our dependence on a small number of key customers for a significant percentage of our sales may negatively affect our profits 
during the past decade  retail sales of consumer products  including battery  electric shaver and lighting products  have been increasingly consolidated into a small number of regional and national mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs 
this trend towards consolidation is occurring on a worldwide basis 
as a result of this consolidation  a significant percentage of our sales are attributable to a very limited group of retailer customers 
wal mart  our largest retailer customer  alone accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales in fiscal sales to wal mart represented approximately of remington s consolidated net sales during its fiscal year ended december  our sales generally are made through the use of individual purchase orders  consistent with industry practice 
because of the importance of these key customers  price or promotional demands by such customers  reductions in their purchases  change in their financial condition or loss of their accounts could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that remington will be successfully integrated 
if we cannot successfully integrate remington s operations  we may experience material adverse consequences to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the integration of companies operating in two distinctly different markets that have previously been operated separately involves a number of risks  including  but not limited to  the following the risks of entering markets in which we have no prior experience  the diversion of management s attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of operations  demands on management related to the significant increase in our size after the acquisition  difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees  difficulties in the assimilation of different corporate cultures and practices  as well as in the assimilation of broad and geographically dispersed personnel and operations  difficulties in the integration of departments  systems  including accounting systems  technologies  books and records and procedures  as well as in maintaining uniform standards and controls  including internal accounting controls  procedures and policies  and expenses of any undisclosed or potential legal liabilities 
prior to the acquisition  rayovac and remington operated as separate entities 
we may not be able to maintain the levels of revenue  earnings or operating efficiency that rayovac or remington had achieved or might achieve separately 
successful integration of remington s operations will depend on our ability to manage those operations  realize opportunities for revenue growth presented by strengthened product offerings and expanded geographic market coverage and  to some degree  eliminate redundant and excess costs 
if we are unable to improve existing products and develop new  innovative products  our sales and market share may suffer 
we believe that our future success in both our battery and electric personal care product markets will depend  in part  upon our ability to continue making innovations in our existing products and to develop  manufacture and market new products 
if we fail to successfully introduce  market and manufacture new products or product innovations  our ability to maintain or grow our market share may be adversely affected  which in turn could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we have made and continue to make significant investments in research and development  as have our competitors 
if our competitors successfully introduce new or enhanced products that eliminate technological advantages our products may have in a certain market segment or otherwise outperform our products  or are perceived by consumers as doing so  we may be unable to compete successfully in market segments affected by these changes 
in the battery market  we may be unable to compete if our competitors develop or apply technology which permits them to manufacture batteries at a lower relative cost 
the fact that our principal competitors have substantially greater resources than us increases this risk 
pre emptive patent rights  restrictions on our ability to expand or modify manufacturing capacity or constraints on our research and development activity may also limit our ability to introduce products that are competitive on a performance basis 
we may make other strategic acquisitions which may divert the attention of management and which may not be successfully integrated into our existing business 
we intend to pursue increased market penetration through additional strategic acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will identify suitable acquisition candidates  that acquisitions will be completed on acceptable terms or that we will be able to successfully integrate the operations of any acquired business into our existing business 
such acquisitions could be of significant size and involve either domestic or international parties 
to acquire and integrate a separate organization would divert management attention from other business activities 
this diversion  together with other difficulties we may encounter in integrating an acquired business  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we may borrow money to finance acquisitions 
such funds might not be available on terms as favorable to us as our current borrowing terms and will increase our leveraged position 
our foreign operations may expose us to a number of risks related to conducting business in foreign countries 
our international operations and exports and imports to and from foreign markets are subject to a number of special risks 
these risks include  but are not limited to economic and political destabilization  governmental corruption and civil unrest  restrictive actions by foreign governments eg  duties  quotas and restrictions on transfer of funds  changes in foreign labor laws and regulations affecting our ability to hire and retain employees  changes in us and foreign laws regarding trade and investment  changes in the economic conditions in these markets  and difficulty in obtaining distribution and support 
in many of the developing countries in which we operate  there has not been significant governmental regulation relating to the environment  occupational safety  employment practices or other business matters routinely regulated in the us as such economies develop  it is possible that new regulations may increase the expense and risk of doing business in such countries 
in addition  social legislation in many countries in which our business operates may result in significantly higher expenses associated with labor costs  terminating employees or distributors and with closing manufacturing facilities 
we may face a number of risks related to foreign currencies 
our foreign sales and certain of our expenses are transacted in foreign currencies 
in fiscal  approximately of our revenues and of our expenses were denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
significant increases in the value of the us dollar in relation to foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we generally hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure  we are still vulnerable to the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
changes in currency exchange rates may also affect our sales to  purchases from and loans to our subsidiaries as well as sales to  purchases from and bank lines of credit with our customers  suppliers and creditors that are denominated in foreign currencies 
we expect that the amount of our revenues and expenses transacted in foreign currencies will increase as our latin american and european operations grow and our exposure to risks associated with foreign currencies could increase accordingly 
sales of our products are seasonal and may cause our quarterly operating results and working capital requirements to fluctuate 
sales of our products are highly seasonal  with a large percentage of net sales occurring during the fiscal quarters ending on or about september and december due to the impact of the december holiday season 
as a result of this seasonality  our inventory and working capital needs fluctuate significantly during the year 
in addition  orders from retailers are often made late in the year  making forecasting of production schedules and inventory purchases difficult 
furthermore  adverse business or economic conditions during these quarters could materially adversely affect results of operations for the full year 
for a more detailed discussion of the seasonality of our product sales  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonal product sales 
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property 
to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights  we rely upon a combination of patent  trademark and trade secret laws  together with licenses  confidentiality agreements and other contractual covenants 
the measures we take to protect our technology and other intellectual property rights may prove inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or other intellectual property 
in addition  our competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
moreover  the laws of certain foreign countries in which we operate or may operate in the future do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us which may negate our competitive or technological advantages in such markets 
also  some of the technology underlying our products is the subject of nonexclusive licenses from third parties 
as a result  this technology could be made available to our competitors at any time 
if this technology were licensed to a competitor  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not have any right to the rayovac trademark in brazil  where the mark is owned by another battery manufacturer  this may negatively affect our ability to pursue growth opportunities in brazil 
third party infringement claims against us could adversely affect our business 
from time to time we have been subject to claims that we are infringing upon the intellectual property of others and it is possible that third parties will assert infringement claims against us in the future 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product delays or require us to enter into licensing or other agreements in order to secure continued access to required technology 
licensing or other agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
if claims of infringement against us are successful  they may also require us to pay significant damages or subject us to an injunction against the sale or use of our products 
in the event of a ruling against us on any such claim  a license or similar agreement may not be available to us on reasonable terms 
remington is involved in a number of legal proceedings with philips with respect to trademarks owned by philips relating to the shape of the head portion of philips three head rotary shaver 
an adverse finding against us in these or similar litigations may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for more information  see legal proceedings litigation 
we are dependent on a few suppliers located in asia for many of our electric personal care products  certain of our razor products are manufactured at one us facility 
the vast majority of our electric personal care products are manufactured by suppliers located in china and japan 
although we have long established relationships with many of these suppliers  we do not have long term contracts with them 
any adverse change in any of the following could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations relationships with our suppliers  the financial condition of our suppliers  the ability to import outsourced products  or our suppliers ability to manufacture and deliver outsourced products on a timely basis 
if our relationship with one of our key suppliers is adversely affected  we may not be able to quickly or effectively replace such supplier and may not be able to retrieve tooling and molds possessed by such supplier 
in addition  we manufacture the majority of our foil cutting systems for our razor product lines  using specially designed machines and proprietary cutting technology  at our manufacturing facility in bridgeport  connecticut 
this manufacturing facility is subject to the normal hazards that could result in any material damage to any such facility 
damage to this facility  or prolonged interruption in the operations of this facility for repairs or other reasons  would have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture and sell our razor products 
our dependence on  and the price of  raw materials may adversely affect our profits 
the principal raw materials used to produce our products including zinc powder  electrolytic manganese dioxide powder and steel are sourced on a global or regional basis  and the prices of those raw materials are susceptible to price fluctuations due to supply demand trends  transportation costs  government regulations and tariffs  changes in currency exchange rates  price controls  the economic climate and other unforeseen circumstances 
we regularly engage in forward purchase and hedging transactions to effectively manage our raw materials costs for the next six to twelve months 
these efforts may not be effective and  if we are unable to pass on raw materials price increases to our customers  our future profitability may be materially adversely affected 
we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain those employees or recruit additional qualified personnel 
we are highly dependent on the continuing efforts of our current executive officers and we likely will depend on the senior management of any business we acquire in the future 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of these persons and the inability to attract and retain qualified replacements 
class action lawsuits  regardless of their merits  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
rayovac and certain of its officers and directors have been named  and we may be named in the future  as defendants of class action lawsuits 
for more information  see legal proceedings litigation 
regardless of their subject matter or the merits  class action lawsuits may result in significant cost to us  divert the attention of management or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may incur material capital and other costs due to environmental liabilities 
because of the nature of our operations  our facilities are subject to a broad range of federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the environment 
these include laws and regulations that govern discharges to the air  water and land  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes  and remediation of contamination associated with release of hazardous substances at our facilities and at off site disposal locations 
risk of environmental liability is inherent in our business 
as a result  material environmental costs may arise in the future 
in particular  we may incur capital and other costs to comply with increasingly stringent environmental laws and enforcement policies 
although we believe that we are substantially in compliance with applicable environmental regulations at our facilities  we may not be in compliance with such regulations in the future  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have facilities that have been in operation by us or prior operators for decades and are constructed on fill that includes  among other things  battery materials containing various heavy metals 
from time to time  we have been required to address the effect of historic activities on the environmental condition of our properties  including without limitation  the effect of the generation and disposal of wastes such as manganese  cadmium and mercury  which are or may be considered hazardous  and releases from underground storage tanks 
we have not conducted invasive testing to identify all potential environmental liability risks 
given the age of our facilities and the nature of our operations  we cannot assure you that material liabilities will not arise in the future in connection with our current or former facilities 
if previously unknown contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of our manufacturing facilities is discovered  we could be required to incur material unforeseen expenses 
if this occurs  it may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have accepted a deed restriction on one such property in lieu of conducting remedial activities  and may consider similar actions at other properties if appropriate 
although we are currently engaged in investigative or remedial projects at a few of our facilities  we do not expect that such projects will cause us to incur material expenditures  however  we cannot assure you that our liability will not be material 
we have been  and in the future may be  subject to proceedings related to our disposal of industrial and hazardous material at off site disposal locations 
these proceedings are under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla or similar state laws that hold persons who arranged for the disposal or treatment of such substances strictly liable for costs incurred in responding to the release or threatened release of hazardous substances from such sites  regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original disposal 
liability under cercla is typically joint and several  meaning that a liable party may be responsible for all of the costs incurred in investigating and remediating contamination at a site 
as a practical matter  liability at cercla sites is shared by all of the viable responsible parties 
while we currently have no pending cercla or similar state matters  we may be named as a potentially responsible party at sites in the future and the costs and liabilities associated with these sites may be material 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the terms of our indebtedness 
we have  and we will continue to have  a significant amount of indebtedness 
as of september   we had total indebtedness of million 
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the terms of our indebtedness  require us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness  which will reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  research and development expenditures and other business activities  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and limit our ability to borrow additional funds even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity or dispose of assets 
in addition  a substantial portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates 
if market interest rates increase  variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements  which would adversely affect our cash flow 
while we may enter into agreements limiting our exposure to higher debt service requirements  any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk 
we will require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts  will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that may be beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior credit facilities or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
despite our current significant level of indebtedness  we may still be able to incur substantially more indebtedness 
this could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness 
we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
although the terms governing our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our outstanding senior subordinated notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 
as of september   our senior credit facilities would have permitted additional borrowing of up to approximately million 
if new indebtedness is added to our and our subsidiaries current indebtedness levels  the related risks that we face would be magnified 
in addition  the indenture does not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness 
the terms of our indebtedness impose  or will impose  restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business and our ability to make payments on our debt 
the agreement governing our senior credit facilities and the indenture governing our outstanding senior subordinated notes each contain covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to borrow money or sell preferred stock  create liens  pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase stock  make certain types of investments  sell stock in our restricted subsidiaries  restrict dividends or other payments from restricted subsidiaries  enter into transactions with affiliates  issue guarantees of debt  and sell assets or merge with other companies 
our senior credit facilities also require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests  including  but not limited to  minimum interest coverage ratio  maximum leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
these covenants could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs and to engage in other business activities that may be in our best interest
