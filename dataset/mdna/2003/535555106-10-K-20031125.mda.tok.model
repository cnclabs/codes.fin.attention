low interest rates and accelerated federal tax depreciation schedules have also supported domestic irrigation equipment purchases 
international irrigation equipment revenues increased by million or compared to fiscal due primarily to an increase in revenues from the company s foreign operations  which increased million over fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in revenues from export sales to the middle east region due to the political unrest there and lower sales to canadian markets due to less favorable market conditions there

capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately to million and will be used to improve the company s facilities  expand its manufacturing capabilities and increase productivity

inflation the company is subject to the effects of changing prices 
during fiscal  the company realized stabilized pricing for purchases of certain commodities  and in particular steel products  used in the production of its products 
while the cost outlook for commodities used in the company s production of its products is not certain  management believes it can manage these inflationary pressures by actively pursuing internal cost reduction efforts and by introducing appropriate sale price adjustments 
off balance sheet arrangements although the company has certain off balance sheet arrangements as described in note p to the consolidated financial statements  these arrangements have not had  nor does the company believe these arrangements are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company s financial condition

the company anticipates further expansion in its us operations 
in the international markets  the company expects to continue to grow sales through its new operations and stronger export sales 
the company continues to view the international markets as its biggest opportunity to improve sales and margins for the next fiscal year 
while its international operations are relatively new  the company remains pleased with their progress in gaining market share and improving operational efficiency 
the company will continue to seek high margin export business in other regions such as the middle east  mexico and australia 
the company s diversified manufacturing business continues to show signs of improvement and potential growth opportunities for diversified have emerged 
risk factors the company s domestic and international irrigation equipment sales are highly dependent on the agricultural industry 
the company s domestic and international irrigation equipment sales are highly dependent upon the need for irrigated agricultural crop production which  in turn  depends upon many factors including total worldwide crop production  the profitability of agricultural crop production  agricultural commodity prices  aggregate net cash farm income  governmental policies regarding the agricultural sector  water and energy conservation policies  the regularity of rainfall  and foreign currency exchange rate 
as farm income decreases  farmers may postpone capital expenditures or seek cheaper alternatives in the used irrigation equipment market 
the company s profitability may be negatively affected by increases in the cost of raw materials  labor and energy 
there is a high level of price competition in the market for irrigation equipment 
therefore  the company may not be able to recover all operating cost increases through price increases which would result in reduced profitability 
whether increased operating costs can be passed through to the customer depends on a number of factors  including farm income  the regularity of rainfall and the price of competing products 
the cost of raw materials can be volatile and is dependent on a number of factors  including availability  demand and freight costs 
the company s international irrigation equipment sales are highly dependent on foreign market conditions 
approximately of the company s revenues are generated from international sales 
specifically  international revenues are generated in australia  canada  central and western europe  mexico  the middle east  south africa and south america 
in addition to general economic and political stability  the company s international sales are affected by international trade barriers  including governmental policies on tariffs  taxes and foreign currency exchange rates 
international sales are also more susceptible to disruption from political instability  armed hostilities and similar incidents 
while our international sales are in us dollars  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect the effective price of our products in foreign countries which in turn can negatively affect international sales 
the company s diversified product revenues are dependent on sales to a few large customers  the loss of which could have an adverse effect on our profitability 
approximately of the company s revenues are generated from sales of our diversified products outsource manufacturing services and the sale of large diameter steel tubing 
while we anticipate that caterpillar inc  deere company and new holland north america  inc will each continue to be significant outsource manufacturing customers  the loss of one or more of these customers could have an adverse effect on the revenues we earn from outsource manufacturing and our overall profitability 
compliance with applicable environmental regulations or standards may require additional capital and operational expenditures 
like other manufacturing concerns  the company is subject to numerous laws and regulations which govern environmental and occupational health and safety matters 
the company believes that its operations are substantially in compliance with all such applicable laws and regulations 
permits are or may be required for some of the operations at its facilities 
although management believes that all currently required permits have been obtained by the company  as with all such permits  they are subject to revocation  modification and renewal 
even where regulations or standards have been adopted  they are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations and implementation 
the company  in  entered into a consent decree with the environmental protection agency of the us federal government concerning its lindsay  nebraska facility which is included in the agency s superfund sites as discussed in note m to the consolidated financial statements 
compliance with applicable environmental regulations or standards may require additional capital and operational expenditures 
however  management does not believe any material additional capital and operational expenditures in an amount greater than the  reserved at august  for such issues are currently required 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is not subject to material market risks with respect to its marketable securities because of their relatively short maturity to months and the company has the ability to hold the investments in these marketable securities to maturity 
the company attempts to manage its transactional foreign exchange exposure by monitoring foreign currency cash flow forecasts and commitments arising from the settlement of receivables and payables  and from future purchases and sales 
the company sells products in over countries and  as a result  is subject to foreign currency exchange rate 
this risk is substantially mitigated because essentially all export sales from the company s us manufacturing facility are denominated in us dollars 
however  sales from the company s manufacturing facilities in france  brazil and south africa are denominated in local currencies 
as a result  the company s most significant transactional foreign currency exposures relate to fluctuations in the values of the euro  the brazilian rand and the south african real in relation to the us dollar 
these fluctuations can negatively affect the company s revenues as the value of foreign currencies decline in relation to the us dollar 
the company also purchases components for its irrigation systems from foreign suppliers 
the cost of these goods will increase if the us dollar devalues against the foreign currency 
the company s translation exposure resulting from translating the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars is not hedged 
the most significant translation exposures are the euro  brazilian real and south african rand in relation to the us dollar
