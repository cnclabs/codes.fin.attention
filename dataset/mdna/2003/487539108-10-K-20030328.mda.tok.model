item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere is this report  including information with respect to our plans and strategies for our business  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the risk factors section of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
overview revenue we derive most of our revenue from professional service activities 
the majority of these activities are billed under various types of contracts with our clients  including fixed price and time and materials contracts 
most of our time and material contracts have not to exceed provisions 
for contracts with either a fixed price or a not to exceed provision  revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting based on the proportion of actual direct contract costs incurred to total estimated direct contract costs at completion 
we believe that costs incurred are the best available measure of progress towards completion on these contracts 
in the course of providing services  we sometimes subcontract for various services 
these costs are included in billings to clients and are included in our gross revenue 
because subcontractor services can change significantly from project to project  changes in gross revenue may not be indicative of business trends 
accordingly  we also report net revenue  which is gross revenue less reimbursable subcontractor costs 
our revenue is generated from a large number of relatively small contracts 
costs of revenue costs of revenue include labor  non reimbursable subcontractor costs  materials and various direct and indirect overhead costs including rent  utilities and depreciation 
direct labor employees work predominantly at our offices and at the clients job sites 
the number of direct labor employees assigned to a contract will vary according to the size  complexity  duration and demands of the project 
contract terminations  completions and scheduling delays may result in periods when direct labor employees are not fully utilized 
as we continue to grow  we anticipate that we will continue to add professional and administrative staff to support our growth 
these professionals are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future 
the significant competition for employees with the skills we require creates wage pressures on professional compensation 
we attempt to increase our billing rates to customers to compensate for wage increases  however  there can be a lag before wage increases can be incorporated into our existing contracts 
some expenses  primarily long term leases  are fixed and cannot be adjusted in reaction to an economic downturn 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of corporate costs related to finance and accounting  information technology  business development and marketing  contract proposals  executive salaries  provisions for doubtful accounts and other indirect overhead costs 

table of contents critical accounting policies and significant estimates under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management is required to make assumptions and estimates that directly impact the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
because of the uncertainties inherent in making assumptions and estimates  actual results in future periods may differ significantly from our assumptions and estimates 
management bases its assumptions and estimates on historical experience and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the following represents what management believes are the critical accounting policies most affected by changes in management estimates and judgments 
revenue and cost recognition estimates on contracts 
we use estimates in recognizing revenue related to our contracts with fixed price or not to exceed provisions 
for such contracts  revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting based on the proportion of actual direct contract costs incurred to total estimated direct contract costs 
we believe that costs incurred are the best available measure of progress towards completion on these contracts 
estimating the total estimated contract cost is a subjective process and requires the use of our best estimates based upon the current information known by us at that point in time 
our estimation of total estimated contract cost has a direct impact on the revenue recognized by us 
if our current estimate of total contract costs turns out to be higher than our previous estimates of total contract cost  then we would have over recognized revenue for that previous period 
conversely  if our current estimates of total contract costs turns out to be lower than our previous estimates of total contract costs  we would have under recognized revenue for that previous period 
in both cases  a job to date adjustment would be made to true up revenue as a change in estimate applied prospectively 
provision for doubtful accounts 
we use estimates in arriving at our allowance for doubtful accounts related to our contracts and trade receivables 
these estimates are based on our best assessment as to the collectibility of the related receivable balance 
future collections of receivables that are different from our current estimates will affect results of operations in future periods 
goodwill 
we use estimates in order to determine if goodwill has been impaired 
an impairment loss may be recognized if the carrying amount of a reporting unit s net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
we arrive at the estimated fair value of a reporting unit by using a variety of customary valuation methods  such as discounted cash flow analysis and multiples of net revenue and earnings before interest and taxes 
these valuation methods use a variety of assumptions such as future billable employee headcount  net revenue  operating income  cash flow  discount rates and multiples 
estimating fair value of a reporting unit is a subjective process and requires the use of our best estimates 
we will perform our valuation analysis annually as well as when an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
if our estimates or assumptions change from those used in our current valuation  we may be required to recognize an impairment loss in future periods 
impact of our industry diversification strategy to help reduce our susceptibility to economic cycles affecting the real estate development industry  we intend to continue expanding our work in the public works infrastructure and the industrial energy industries 
we believe that among other business initiatives  our acquisition strategy may play a significant role in contributing to this objective 
the acquisitions of pacific engineering corporation and universal energy inc during  alnm group  inc in and anticipated future acquisitions  many of which may include engineering services outside of the real estate development industry  may have a significant impact on our future net revenue mix 
due to these and potential future acquisitions  we anticipate that our margins may be affected by the decreased business concentration from the real estate development industry which has historically yielded higher margins than services provided to the public works infrastructure and industrial energy industries 
key events in october  we acquired crosby mead benton associates cmb which provides engineering and design services for real estate projects in southern california 

table of contents in january  we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the liabilities of hook associates engineering  inc hook  an engineering and consulting services firm with offices located in phoenix  arizona  denver  colorado and cheyenne  wyoming  providing a full range of services to clients in an array of industries including real estate development and public works infrastructure 
in may  we completed a secondary offering of an aggregate of million shares of common stock including an over allotment of  shares  of which million shares were sold by the company and  shares were sold by selling shareholders 
the public offering price was per share  which resulted in net proceeds of approximately million 
in september  we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the liabilities of pacific engineering corporation pec  an oregon based engineering and design services firm specializing in the fields of power transmission and distribution  hydroelectric energy facilities  and other utility infrastructure services 
in november  we acquired texas based universal energy  inc uei and its wholly owned subsidiary amerex international  inc  which provide start up management  technical support  facility acquisition analysis  operations and maintenance  and manpower augmentation to the power industry 
in march  we acquired michigan based alnm group  inc alnm which specializes in government services with expertise in environmental  civil  mechanical and electrical engineering  and surveying 
in  we closed three of our divisions 
two of these divisions related to our hook operations located in colorado and wyoming  and  the third was our internally created communication division which was located in california 
the closures were primarily due to lower than expected operating results and continuing difficult market conditions 
results of operations the following table sets forth supplemental consolidated operating results for each of the periods presented as a percentage of net revenue 
years ended december  gross revenue subcontractor costs net revenue costs of revenue gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest income interest expense income  net other expenses income  net income before provision for income taxes and discontinued operations provision for income taxes income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net income 
table of contents the following table sets forth the company s consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  and includes the dollar and percentage change compared to the prior fiscal year years ended december  change change dollars in thousands gross revenue subcontractor costs net revenue costs of revenue gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest income interest expense income  net other expenses income  net income before provision for income taxes and discontinued operations provision for income taxes income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net income years ended december  and december  net revenue 
the growth in net revenue for compared to is primarily attributable to acquisitions  which contributed million in net revenue 
the acquired companies mainly contributing to this net revenue growth include pacific engineering corporation pec  universal energy inc uei  and alnm group  inc 
alnm  whose operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since october  december and march  respectively 
excluding the net revenue from these acquisitions  net revenue increased by million  or  compared to the increase in net revenue  excluding acquisitions  primarily resulted from i a strong southern california residential real estate market  which continued to experience an increase in demand  and ii higher net revenue derived from the company s water resource services 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in net revenue generated by the company s arizona office which is part of the hook operations coupled with lower net revenue generated from the company s orange county office resulting mainly from a continued weak commercial and industrial real estate market 
subcontractor costs  as a percentage of net revenue  increased to during compared to during  resulting largely from an increase in subcontractor costs related to several large contracts in the industrial and energy industry 
difficulties in the power generation segment of the energy industry have caused a decline in the pace of construction of new power plants and or alternative power solutions 
as a result  our industrial energy industry began to experience a reduction in net revenue during the fourth quarter of if the difficulties continue  they may cause further reductions in net revenue and therefore net income in our industrial energy industry 
gross profit 
the increase in gross profit was mainly attributable to acquisitions  which added gross profit of million during compared to the prior year 
excluding the gross profit from acquisitions  gross profit increased million or during as compared to this increase was primarily 
table of contents attributable to strong gross profit resulting from continued demand for residential real estate in southern california and higher gross profit generated from the company s water resource services  all of which were partially offset by lower gross profit from i the hook arizona office  ii one of our northern california offices  and iii our uei division  as mentioned above 
as a percentage of net revenue  gross profit decreased to during from during the percentage decrease was primarily related to lower margins related to the company s industrial and energy industry  the hook arizona office  and alnm which mainly provides services in the public works infrastructure industry 
the increase in the costs of revenue was primarily attributable to increased expenses associated with the growth in our total direct employee base  which grew from an average of in to in this increase is primarily a result of acquisitions 
as noted above  due to a continuing decline in the pace of construction of new power plants  and or alternative power solutions  our industrial energy industry experienced a reduction in its gross profit in the fourth quarter of if this decline continues  it may cause our industrial energy industry to experience a continued reduction of gross profits and therefore also a reduction in net income 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily related to acquisitions  an increase in corporate administrative costs  and an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts  all of which were partially offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization  as compared to acquired companies contributed million of selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to as a percentage of net revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased slightly to during from during  mainly from the elimination of goodwill amortization which was partially offset by the increase in the provision for doubtful accounts 
interest income 
the decrease in interest income resulted from lower yields on cash and securities  partially offset by an increase in the average balance of cash and securities as compared to interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to a reduction of interest expense associated with the acquisition modification agreement as discussed under the liquidity and capital resources section related to hook  which resulted in the cancellation of a million acquisition note payable and the overall reduction of debt as compared to other income 
the increase in other income was primarily associated with  resulting from a purchase price adjustment in connection with the acquisition of cmb and hook 
income taxes 
the increase in provision for income taxes resulted primarily from higher pre tax income and a slightly higher effective tax rate during our effective income tax rate was approximately during compared to during discontinued operations 
the loss from discontinued operations is attributable to the closure of three of our divisions during two of these divisions related to our hook operations located in colorado and wyoming  and  the third was our internally created communication division which was located in california 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the activities of these divisions have been segregated and reported as discontinued operations during and the increase in the loss from discontinued operations was mainly due to continuing difficult market conditions and deteriorating operating results in colorado 

table of contents the following table sets forth the company s consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  and includes the dollar and percentage change compared to the prior fiscal year years ended december  change change dollars in thousands gross revenue subcontractor costs net revenue costs of revenue gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest income interest expense other expenses income  net income before provisions for income taxes and discontinued operations provision for income taxes income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net income years ended december  and december  net revenue 
the net revenue growth for compared to is primarily attributable to acquisitions 
the acquisitions of cmb  which closed in the fourth quarter of  and hook  pec  and uei  all of which closed in  contributed million excludes cmb results for the fourth quarter of to net revenue during compared to excluding the net revenue from acquisitions  net revenue increased million or 
the remaining net revenue growth was primarily due to i growth in the company s civil engineering services resulting from the strong demand for real estate in southern california and nevada  and ii the contribution of net revenue from a new division 
the new division is a civil engineering office located in ventura county  california  which commenced operations during the fourth quarter of the new division contributed approximately  to the company s net revenue during the above mentioned increases in net revenue during were partially offset by lower net revenue at one of the company s northern california offices resulting from decreased activity on several large projects with high profit margins 
subcontractor costs  as a percentage of net revenue  increased to during compared to during  resulting largely from an increase in subcontractor costs related to several large contracts in our industrial energy segment 
gross profit 
the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to acquisitions  which added gross profit of million during as compared to the prior year 
excluding the gross profit from acquisitions  gross profit remained consistent with that of the prior year 
as a percentage of net revenue  gross profit increased slightly to during from during the increase in the cost of revenue is primarily attributable to increased expenses associated with the growth in our total direct employee base  which grew from an average of in to in  coupled with an increase in facilities expense 
such increases primarily resulted from acquisitions 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily related to acquisitions  goodwill amortization  and higher overall corporate costs 
as a percentage of net revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to during from during the percentage increase was primarily related to higher administrative costs  additional contract proposal time  goodwill amortization see effect of recent accounting pronouncements for discussion on the treatment of goodwill  and higher legal services and settlement costs  all of which were partially offset by a lower provision for doubtful accounts 
interest income 
the increase in interest income resulted from interest earned on securities purchased with a portion of the net proceeds generated from the company s may secondary offering 
interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the repayment of a million acquisition note in april  and the repayment of the outstanding balance on our line of credit in may this decrease was partially offset by increased interest expense related to a million note issued in connection with the hook acquisition in january income taxes 
this increase in provision for income taxes resulted primarily from a higher taxable income base  mitigated by a lower effective income tax rate during our effective income tax rate was approximately during compared to during discontinued operations 
we closed down the operations of three divisions during two of these divisions are related to our hook operations in colorado and wyoming  and the third was our internally created communication division located in california 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the activities of these divisions have been segregated and reported as discontinued operations during these divisions did not exist in  hence the increase in loss from discontinued operations during related party in march  we entered into change in control agreements with aram h 
keith  our chief executive officer and chairman of the board  eric c 
nielsen  our president  chief operating officer and a director of our company  and gary c 
campanaro  our chief financial officer  secretary and a director of our company 
these agreements provide that if the executive officer s employment with us terminates as a result of an involuntary or constructive termination as these terms are defined in the agreements at any time within two years following a change in control  then  in addition to other benefits  the executive officer will receive a one time payment  equal to two times the executive officer s highest annual level of total cash compensation including any and all bonus amounts paid by us to that executive officer during any one of the three consecutive calendar years inclusive of the year of termination immediately prior to termination 
the executive officer also is entitled to receive a payment by us to offset any excise tax under the internal revenue code of  as amended  that has been levied against the executive officer for payments that we have made to him 
in addition  any unvested options previously granted to the executive officer will immediately vest and become exercisable as of the date of termination and remain exercisable until their respective expiration dates 
we have not entered into any material related party transactions during liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents combined with securities held to maturity totaled million as of december   compared to million as of december  working capital as of december  was million compared to million as of december   an increase of million 
our debt to equity ratio excluding the effect of issuable common stock as of december  improved to to compared to to at december  cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million  or  to million during compared to million during the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily a result of higher income before the effects of depreciation and amortization  and an increase in working capital  as compared to 
table of contents cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities decreased by million  to million during compared to million during the decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of the proceeds received from securities held to maturity during  partially offset by an increase in net cash expended for acquisitions 
capital expenditures during were million compared to million during cash flows from financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities increased by million  to million during compared to million of net cash provided by financing activities during the reason for this change from cash provided by financing activities to cash used in financing activities was mainly due to our stock offering in  which was partially offset by a reduction in principal payments on our debt during in september  we entered into a million unsecured line of credit agreement consisting of three components i an acquisition component  ii an equipment and vehicle financing component  and iii a working capital component 
the line provides up to a maximum of million to finance acquisitions  up to a maximum of million to finance equipment and vehicle purchases and up to a maximum of million less the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the acquisition  and equipment and vehicle components for working capital 
the line bears interest at either a range of below prime to prime  or a range of to over libor depending on our ability to meet certain financial covenants 
in september  the line of credit was amended to extend the maturity on the equipment and vehicle financing components from september to september  and to extend the maturity on the acquisition and working capital components from june to june there were no amounts outstanding under this line of credit agreement as of december  in july  we entered into a modification agreement relating to the acquisition of hook 
under this agreement  the following obligations have been terminated a  acquisition note payable and  in issuable common stock 
also under this agreement  the company paid  and may pay up to an additional  if certain future conditions are met 
in july  we exercised certain provisions under the purchase agreement related to the cmb acquisition which allowed us to reduce the purchase price and resulted in the cancellation of an obligation to issue  in common stock 
in november  we entered into a month million letter of credit securing a facility lease in irvine  california relating to the company s orange county  tettemer and corporate divisions 
we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or otherwise 
furthermore  we have not engaged in energy or commodity trading activities and do not anticipate doing so in the future  nor do we have any transactions involving unconsolidated entities or special purpose entities 
on occasion  we will enter into purchase agreements related to acquisitions which provide for future purchase price payments or earn outs as a result of achieving certain operating results by the acquired companies 
as a result of these earn out provisions  we may be obligated to pay additional consideration in future periods 
current accounting principles require that such earn outs be accrued on our balance sheet only at the point at which the earn out period has elapsed and the performance targets have been met 
as of december   we may be obligated to pay a maximum of million over the next years in additional purchase price related to our acquisitions  of which approximately will be paid in cash with the remaining to be paid out in our common stock 
such potential earn outs are not currently reflected on our balance sheet as the earn out period has not elapsed and  therefore  the achievement of the performance target is currently unknown 

table of contents the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in the future 
payments due by period and total thereafter capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations future cash requirements we expect to fund our future liquidity needs primarily from i operating cash flows  ii existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and securities held to maturity  and iii borrowings under our million unsecured revolving line of credit  which we have not utilized as of december  we believe these sources of funds will be sufficient to provide for our operations and planned capital expenditures and satisfy our scheduled principal and interest payment obligations on our debt and capital lease obligations for the next twelve months 
we expect our capital expenditures in fiscal to range between approximately million to million 
we also intend to use available liquidity to continue our acquisition strategy 
we continue to examine acquisitions of complementary businesses and anticipate that our liquidity will be sufficient to provide for potential acquisitions for the next twelve months 
however  the pace and size of acquisitions are difficult to predict 
we may complete more or fewer acquisitions than we currently contemplate depending on the opportunities that present themselves  and our cash requirements may change accordingly 
effect of recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statement of the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ending after december  and are included in the notes to our financial statements 
although we have adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 we intend to continue applying accounting principles board opinion no 
in accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in april and july  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standard no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas  and no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  respectively 
sfas prescribes amendments to existing pronouncements on accounting for early retirements of debt 
the provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued on or after may  sfas addresses issues pertaining to costs associated with exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the company does not believe that the adoption of these standards will have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in october  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas supersedes financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and requires i the 
table of contents recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and ii the measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which became effective january  this statement requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized 
therefore  no goodwill amortization expense was incurred during the company is required to perform its impairment test annually unless events or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired 
in addition  in the year of adoption  the company was also required to perform a transitional test of goodwill for impairment as of january  the company has completed its transitional impairment testing and no changes to the carrying value of goodwill were made 
accordingly  the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations which was effective upon issuance 
this statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
inflation although our operations can be influenced by general economic trends  we do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented 
due to the short term nature of most of our contracts  if costs of revenue increase  we will attempt to pass these increases to our clients 
the following discussion summarizes material risks which you should carefully consider before you decide to invest in our common stock or to maintain or increase your investment 
any of the following risks  if they actually occur  would likely harm our business 
the trading price of our common stock could then decline  and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock 
risk factors risks related to our industries our business could suffer if there is a downturn in the real estate market we estimate that during  approximately of our services were rendered in connection with commercial and residential real estate development projects 
reduced demand in the real estate market would likely decrease the demand for our services 
a decrease in the demand for our services could result in cash flow difficulties and potential operating losses for our company 
the real estate market and  therefore  our business  may be impacted by a number of factors  which may include changes in employment levels and other national and local economic conditions  changes in interest rates and in the availability  cost and terms of financing  the impact of present or future environmental  zoning or other laws and regulations  changes in real estate tax rates and assessments and other operating expenses  changes in levels of government spending and fiscal policies  and earthquakes and other natural or manmade disasters and other factors which are beyond our control 
we derive revenue from contracts with government agencies 
any disruption in government funding or in our relationship with those agencies could adversely affect our business the demand for our services is related to the level of government program funding that is allocated to rebuild  improve and expand the nation s infrastructure 
we believe that the success and further development 
table of contents of our business depends  in part  upon the continued funding of these government programs and upon our ability to participate in these government programs 
we cannot assure that governments will have the available resources to fund these programs  that these programs will continue to be funded even if governments have available financial resources or that we will continue to win government contracts 
some of these government contracts are subject to renewal or extensions annually  so we cannot be assured of our continued work under these contracts in the future 
unsuccessful bidders may protest or challenge the award of these contracts 
in addition  government agencies can terminate these contracts at their convenience 
as a result  we may incur costs in connection with the termination of these contracts and suffer a loss of business 
also  contracts with government agencies are subject to substantial regulation and an audit of actual costs incurred 
consequently  there may be a downward adjustment in our revenue if actual recoverable costs exceed billed recoverable costs 
we derive revenue from engineering services provided to the energy industry 
continued disruption in the pace of construction for new power plants  cogeneration facilities  and electrical distribution facilities could adversely affect our business the demand for our services is related to the level and pace of construction of energy related solutions 
we believe that the success and further development of this aspect of our business depends  in part  upon the need and funding of these projects 
high energy prices  power shortages  and pressure at state and federal levels for increased supply resulted in the increased demand for energy related solutions with an unprecedented number of new power plants  cogeneration facilities  and electrical distribution facilities projects announcements in however  a weakening demand and softening economy combined with a decline in energy prices have caused builders of such energy related solutions to reconsider planned projects 
many have announced downsizing or cancellations of new power plants and or alternative power solutions 
a continued decline in the pace of construction of new power plants and or alternative power solutions could have an adverse affect on our industrial energy industry 
we may have difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified professionals  which may harm our reputation in the marketplace and restrict our ability to implement our business strategy we derive our revenue almost exclusively from services performed by our professionals 
we may not be able to attract and retain the desired number of professionals over the short or long term 
there is significant competition for professionals with the skills necessary for the provision of our services from major and boutique consulting  engineering  research and other professional service firms 
our inability to attract and retain qualified professionals could impede our ability to secure and complete engagements  in which event  we may lose market share and our revenues and profit may decline 
terrorism and the uncertainty of war may have a material adverse effect on our operating results the terrorist attacks that took place in the united states on september   along with the united states military campaign against terrorism in afghanistan and elsewhere  ongoing violence in the middle east and increasing speculation regarding future military action against iraq  have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may materially affect the markets in which we operate  and our operations and profitability 
the disruption of our business as a result of these events  including disruptions and deferrals of real estate development projects  had an immediate adverse impact on our business 
the short term and long term effects of these developments on our customers  the markets for our services and the us economy are uncertain 
the consequences of any terrorist attacks  or any armed conflicts that may result  are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our markets  or our business 

table of contents risk factors risks related to our business our revenue  income and cash flow could decline if there is a downturn in the california economy or real estate market we estimate that during  approximately of our net revenue was derived from services rendered in california 
poor economic conditions in california may significantly reduce the demand for our services and decrease our revenue and profits 
from to  our business was negatively impacted during the real estate market downturn in southern california  and we experienced cash flow difficulties and substantial operating losses 
if we are unable to effectively manage our growth  we could incur unforeseen costs or delays and our reputation and reliability in the marketplace could be damaged we have grown rapidly and intend to pursue further growth  through acquisitions and otherwise  as part of our business strategy but we may not be able to manage our growth effectively and efficiently 
our inability to manage our growth effectively and efficiently could cause us to incur unforeseen costs  time delays or otherwise adversely impact our business  any of which could cause a decline in our revenues and profitability 
our rapid growth has presented and will continue to present numerous administrative and operational challenges  including the management of an expanding array of engineering and consulting services  the assimilation of financial reporting systems  increased pressure on our senior management and increased demand on our systems and internal controls 
if we are unable to successfully implement our acquisition strategy  current expectations of our growth or operating results may not be met our growth strategy includes the strategic acquisition of companies that expand our service offerings and geographic presence  including acquisitions that may be larger than our historic acquisitions 
if we are unsuccessful in implementing our acquisition strategy  we could fail to achieve the revenue and profitability growth that we currently expect 
we may not be successful in implementing our acquisition strategy for a number of reasons  including the following we may fail to consummate an acquisition even if an announcement had been made to acquire a target company  as the engineering industry consolidates  suitable acquisition candidates are expected to become more difficult to locate and may only be available at an increased price or under terms that are less favorable than in the past  we may not be able to arrange suitable financing to consummate an acquisition  we may not be successful in integrating an acquired company s professionals  clientele and culture into ours  we may not be successful in generating the same level of operating performance as an acquired company experienced prior to the acquisition  as we expand our service offerings and geographic presence  we may not be able to maintain the current level of quality of services  we may not be able to maintain our reputation in an acquired entity s geographic area or service offerings and as a consequence  our ability to attract and retain clients in those or other areas may be negatively impacted  an acquired company may be less profitable than us resulting in reduced profit margins  and the acquisition and subsequent integration of an acquired company may require a significant amount of management s time diverting their attention from our existing operations and clients  which could result in the loss of key employees or clients 

table of contents if our estimates or assumptions used in arriving at the fair value of acquired entities change from those used in our current valuations  we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment loss we use estimates in order to determine if goodwill has been impaired 
an impairment loss may be required to be recognized if the carrying amount of a reporting unit s net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
we arrive at the estimated fair value of a reporting unit by using a variety of customary valuation methods  such as discounted cash flow analysis and multiples of net revenue and earnings before interest and taxes 
these valuation methods use a variety of assumptions such as future billable employee headcount  net revenue  operating income  cash flow  discount rates and multiples 
estimating fair value of a reporting unit is a subjective process and requires the use of our best estimates 
if our estimates or assumptions change from those used in our current valuation  we may be required to recognize an impairment loss 
as of december   our goodwill balance was million 
we could lose money if we fail to accurately estimate our costs on fixed price contracts or contracts with not to exceed provisions we expect to perform services under contracts that may limit our profitability 
under fixed price contracts we perform services at a stipulated price 
under time and materials contracts with not to exceed provisions  we are reimbursed for the number of labor hours expended at an established hourly rate plus the cost of materials incurred  subject however  to a stated maximum dollar amount for the services to be provided under the contract 
in both of these types of contracts  we agree to provide our services based on our estimate of the costs a particular project will involve 
our estimates are not always accurate 
underestimation of costs for these types of contracts may cause us to incur losses or result in a project not being as profitable as we expected 
we may fail to estimate costs accurately for a number of reasons  including weakness in the management of our projects  loss of efficiency resulting from cross utilization of office staff from various locations  changes in the costs of goods and services that may occur during the contract period  problems with new technologies  and delays beyond our control 
our backlog is an uncertain indicator of future financial performance and it is subject to adjustment or cancellation our gross revenue backlog as of december  was approximately million 
there is no assurance that the entire balance of our backlog will convert into revenue since our contracts are subject to scope adjustments and or cancellations 
these types of scope adjustments or cancellations may result in a reduction in our backlog which could adversely affect our revenue and profit 
the loss of mr 
keith could adversely affect our business  including our ability to secure and complete engagements and attract and retain employees we do not have an employment agreement with  or maintain key man life insurance on aram h 
keith  our chief executive officer 
if we lose the services of mr 
keith  we may be less likely to secure or complete contracts and to attract and retain additional employees 
the efforts  abilities  business generation capabilities and name recognition of mr 
keith are important to our success in those activities 
if our employees leave our company and join a competitor  we may lose business our employees might leave our company and become competitors of ours 
if this happens  we may lose some of our existing clients that have formed relationships with our former employees 
in addition  we may lose future clients to a former employee as a new competitor 
in either event  we could lose clients and revenue  and our profitability could decline 

table of contents our business may expose us to liability in excess of our current insurance coverage we are exposed to potential liabilities to clients for errors or omissions in the services we perform 
such liabilities could exceed our current insurance coverage and the fees we derive from those services 
we cannot always predict the magnitude of these potential liabilities but due to the large size of the projects on which we typically provide services  claims could be millions of dollars 
a partially or completely uninsured claim  if successful and of significant magnitude  could result in substantial losses 
we currently maintain general liability insurance  umbrella  professional liability  directors and officers  and various types of other insurance policies 
claims may be made against us which exceed the limits of these policies  in which case we would be liable to pay these claims from our assets 
our professional liability and directors and officers policies are claims made policies and only claims made during the term of the policy are covered 
if we terminate our policies and do not obtain retroactive coverage  we would be uninsured for claims made after termination even if these claims are based on events or acts that occurred during the term of the policy 
our insurance policies typically have various exceptions to the claims covered and also require us to assume some costs of the claim even though a portion of the claim may be covered  resulting in potential liability to us 
further  our expansion into new services or geographic areas could result in our failure to obtain coverage for these services or areas  or the coverage being offered may be at a higher cost than our current coverage 
due to the current insurance environment we have experienced and may continue to experience  an increase in our insurance premiums 
we may not be able to pass these increases on to our clients in increased billing rates 
if we are unable to engage qualified subcontractors  we may lose projects  revenue and clients we often contract with outside companies to perform designated portions of the services we perform for our clients 
if we are unable to engage subcontractors  our ability to perform under some of our contracts may be impeded and the quality of our service may decline 
as a consequence  we may lose projects  revenue and clients 
for  subcontractor costs accounted for approximately of our net revenue 
we derive revenue from contracts for work performed in foreign countries which are subject to a number of risks that could adversely affect the results from these contracts international business is subject to the customary risks associated with international transactions  including political risks  local law and taxes  difficulty in enforcing contracts  the potential imposition of trade or currency exchange restrictions  tariff increases and difficulties or delays in collecting accounts receivables 
weak foreign economies and or a weakening of foreign currencies against the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk factors risks related to ownership of our stock our stock price may decrease  which could result in significant losses for investors or adversely affect our business the following factors could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease  perhaps substantially the failure of our quarterly operating results to meet expectations  adverse developments in the worldwide economy  the financial markets  the engineering and consulting services market  the real estate market  the public works infrastructure market  and or the industrial energy market  interest rates  our failure to meet securities analysts expectations  changes in accounting principles  sales of common stock by existing shareholders or holders of options  
table of contents announcements of key developments by our competitors  the reaction of markets and securities analysts to announcements and developments involving our company  and resolution of threatened or pending litigation 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
we may in the future  be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
insiders have substantial control over us  which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions our executive officers and directors  in the aggregate  hold approximately of our outstanding common stock 
these shareholders  if they act together  can have significant influence over most matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
if we need to sell or issue additional shares of common stock and or incur additional debt to finance future acquisitions  your stock ownership could be diluted our business strategy is to expand into new markets and enhance our position in existing markets through the acquisition of complementary businesses 
in order to successfully complete targeted acquisitions or to fund our other activities  we may issue additional equity securities that could dilute your stock ownership 
we may also incur additional debt if we acquire another company  and this could negatively impact our results of operations 
our board of directors has the ability to discourage takeover attempts  which may reduce or eliminate your ability to sell your shares for a premium in a change of control transaction our amended and restated articles of incorporation provide us with the ability to issue blank check preferred stock without consulting our shareholders 
as a result  our board of directors may frustrate a takeover attempt by issuing shares to a friendly shareholder or acquirer  implementing a poison pill or otherwise due to features of newly issued preferred stock 
shares of our common stock eligible for public sale could cause the market price of our stock to drop  even if our business is doing well we currently have approximately million shares of common stock outstanding 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that these sales could occur  and could adversely affect the market price for our common stock 
certain shareholders hold large amounts of shares which they are able to sell in the public market 
significant sales of these shares could cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of the performance of our business 
these sales also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our securities held to maturity  line of credit  and long term debt  which are used to maintain liquidity and to fund capital expenditures and our expansion 
the company intends to hold all of its securities until maturity  and therefore  should not bear any interest rate risk due to early disposition 
due to the relatively immaterial levels of our current borrowings  our earnings and cash flows should not be materially impacted by changes in interest rates 
our bank line of credit is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market rates 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate hedging transactions 

table of contents the table below presents the principal amounts of securities held to maturity  weighted average interest rates  fair values and other items required by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes as of december  fair value securities held to maturity non trading weighted average interest rate the fair value for securities held to maturity was based on the quoted market price of such securities as of december  approximately of the company s securities held to maturity are invested in federally tax exempt bonds 
the weighted average interest rate shown above is a combination of pre tax interest rate for taxable securities and an after tax interest rate for tax exempt securities 
as the table incorporates only those exposures that existed as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not presented in the table above  the information presented in the table has limited predictive value 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on those exposures or positions that arise during the period and interest rates
