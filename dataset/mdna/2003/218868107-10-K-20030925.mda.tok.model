item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report on form k 
background and overview as of june   we operated colleges and two training centers  with more than  students  in states 
during the fiscal year ended june   our company had net revenues of million 
our revenues consist principally of student tuition  enrollment fees and bookstore sales  and are presented as net revenues after adjustments for refunds related to students who do not complete their courses 
we recognize revenue on a pro rata on a straight line basis over the relevant period attended by the student of the applicable course or program 
net revenues increased to million in from million in the increase was largely the result of a increase in student population and a increase in average tuition rate per student during the period 
tuition revenues  which represented of fiscal total net revenues  fluctuate with the aggregate enrolled student population and the average program or credit hour charge 
the student population varies depending on  among other factors  the number of i continuing students at the beginning of a fiscal period  ii new student enrollments during the fiscal period  iii students who have previously withdrawn but who reenter during the fiscal period  and iv graduations and withdrawals during the fiscal period 
new student starts typically occur on a monthly basis in the diploma granting colleges 
in the degree granting colleges  the majority of new student starts occur in the first month of each calendar quarter with an additional mini start in the second month of each quarter in most colleges 
the tuition charges vary by college depending on the local market  the program level  such as diploma  associate s  bachelor s or master s degree  and the specific curriculum 
the majority of students at our colleges rely on funds received under various government sponsored student financial aid programs to pay a substantial portion of their tuition and other education related expenses 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenues  on a cash basis  were derived from federal student financial aid programs 
we categorize our expenses as educational services  general and administrative  and marketing and advertising 
educational services expense primarily consists of those costs incurred to deliver and administer the education programs at the colleges  including faculty and college administration compensation  education materials and supplies  college facility rent and other occupancy costs  bad debt expense  depreciation and amortization of college property and equipment  and default management expenses and financial aid processing costs 
general and administrative expense consists principally of those costs incurred at the corporate and regional level in support of college operations  except for marketing and advertising related costs 
included in general and administrative expenses are costs relating to executive management  corporate staff and regional operations management compensation  rent and other occupancy costs for corporate headquarters  depreciation and amortization of corporate property and equipment and certain intangibles  and other expenses incurred at corporate headquarters 
additionally  all incentive compensation expenses are included in general and administrative expenses 
marketing and advertising expense includes compensation for college admissions staff  regional admissions personnel  compensation expenses for marketing and advertising management  and all direct advertising and production costs 
we expense advertising costs as incurred 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussions and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make 
table of contents estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts on those financial statements 
note to the consolidated financial statements in the annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june  describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts  intangible assets  deferred taxes  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or if our assumptions change 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition 
we maintain a revenue recognition policy 
revenues consist primarily of tuition and fees derived from courses taught in our colleges  schools  and training centers 
revenue from tuition and fees are recognized pro rata on a straight line basis over the relevant period attended by the student of the applicable course or program 
if a student withdraws from a course or program  the paid but unearned portion of the student tuition is refunded 
textbook sales and other revenues are recognized as sales occur or services are performed and represent less than of total revenues 
prepaid tuition is the portion of payments received but not earned and is reflected as a current liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as this amount is expected to be earned within the next year 
students attending our institutions enroll in either i diploma programs  which cover a specific area of training over a discrete length of time averaging nine months for such programs or ii courses leading to an associate  bachelor or master s degree 
costs of programs or credit hours for courses are clearly identified in the company s enrollment agreements 
at the start of each student s respective program or course of study leading to a degree  the student executes an enrollment agreement which specifies the field of study  the expected length of study  and the cost of the program or course 
we recognize revenue from tuition and fees pro rata over the relevant period attended by the student of the applicable course or program of study 
if a student withdraws from an institution  we cease the recognition of revenue and the paid but unearned portion of the student tuition is refunded 
additionally  to ensure the delivery of education has occurred  either attendance is taken or academic events are conducted at appropriate intervals to ensure that the student is completing his or her respective field of study within the acceptable time period 
marketing and advertising expense 
we maintain an advertising expense recognition policy 
marketing and advertising costs are generally expensed as incurred 
we have significant marketing and advertising expenses consisting primarily of payroll and payroll related expenses  direct response and other advertising  promotional materials and other related marketing costs 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability  failure or refusal of our students to make required payments 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing the accounts receivable aging and applying various expected loss percentages to certain student accounts receivable categories based upon historical bad debt experience 
we generally write off accounts receivable balances deemed uncollectible as they are sent to collection agencies 
we offer a variety of payment plans to help students pay that portion of their education expense not covered by financial aid programs 
these balances are unsecured and not guaranteed 
we believe our reserves are adequate  however  losses related to unpaid student balances could exceed the amounts we have reserved for bad debts 
many of our students participate in federally guaranteed student loan programs 
the federally guaranteed student loans are authorized by the higher education act hea of and are guaranteed by an agency of the federal government  not us 
the guaranteed loans are neither guaranteed by us  nor can the student guaranteed loans become an obligation of the ours 
accordingly  we do not record an obligation to repay any of the guaranteed loans that are not repaid by our former students and 
table of contents we do not record either a contingent obligation or an allowance for future obligations as a result of student defaults of federally guaranteed student loans 
the guarantee of student loans is provided by an agency of the federal government  not by us 
if an institutions former students default rate on guaranteed loans cohort default rate equals or exceeds for three consecutive years  the institution may lose participation eligibility in the guaranteed loan program and its students would be denied access to the guaranteed loan program 
our institutions cohort default rates act as a gatekeeper to the institutions eligibility to participate in the federal student financial aid programs 
we have no obligation to repay any of the federally guaranteed loans that our former students default upon  even if the cohort default rates of our students exceed permitted levels 
rather  if the cohort default rates at a particular institution exceed for three consecutive years  the institutions students may lose eligibility to receive federal student financial aid 
intangible assets 
we have significant intangible assets  including goodwill 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
we have adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and do not amortize goodwill 
we assign values to other intangible assets  such as curriculum  trade names and accreditation 
although we believe our intangible assets are fairly stated  changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact the reported values of intangible assets which could result in future reductions to earnings and require adjustments to asset balances 
deferred taxes 
we currently have deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realization of our deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon achievement of projected future taxable income offset by deferred tax liabilities 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets annually 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and have adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  related to options issued to employees and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
no stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income 
all options  stock appreciation rights or other common stock based securities granted are accounted for under fixed accounting and have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant
