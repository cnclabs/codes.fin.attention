change in accounting principle in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached consensus on issue  accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor 
issue addresses the accounting for cash consideration received from a vendor by a reseller for various vendor funded allowances  including cooperative advertising support 
issue is effective for new arrangements or modifications to existing arrangements entered into after december   although early adoption is permitted 
we elected to adopt early  effective february   the provisions of issue in the preparation of this annual report on form k 
accordingly  in fiscal  we recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change of million  million net of income tax  for the impact of this adoption on prior fiscal years 
as of february   million of our vendor advertising allowances has been recorded as a reduction of inventory and will be recognized in cost of goods sold as inventory is sold 
this adoption has also resulted in the reclassification of million of vendor advertising reimbursements earned in fiscal from selling  general  and administrative expense 
the fiscal impact on income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was a charge of million  or per diluted share 
in accordance with the provisions of issue  vendor advertising allowances which exceed specific  incremental and identifiable costs incurred in relation to the advertising and promotional events we conduct for our vendors are to be classified as a reduction in the purchase price of merchandise and recognized in income as the merchandise is sold 
the amount of vendor allowances to be recorded as a reduction of inventory was determined by calculating the ratio of vendor allowances in excess of specific  incremental and identifiable advertising and promotional costs to merchandise purchases 
we then applied this ratio to the value of inventory in determining the amount of the vendor reimbursements to be recorded as a reduction to inventory reflected on the balance sheet 
this methodology resulted in a million reduction in inventory as of february   the date of adoption of issue the million  million net of tax  is recorded as a cumulative effect of accounting change in fiscal year as of february   the methodology resulted in million recorded as a reduction of inventory

these allowances exceeded the specific  incremental costs of the advertising and promotional events conducted by us 
the portion of the allowances in excess of the specific  incremental costs was recorded as an offset to other operating expenses within selling  general and administrative expenses 
these other operating expenses  which were incurred to support advertising and promotional expenses  included such items as marketing and merchandise department expenses to develop  promote and manage the events  direct store and store supervisory payroll expenses to implement  manage and monitor the events  distribution expenses associated with receiving and shipping of materials necessary for the events  and corporate expenses related to the design  production and maintenance of internet advertising events

the transaction resulted in net proceeds after offering expenses to us of approximately million

in fiscal  the million increase in inventory  net of accounts payable  was due to an increased store base coupled with slower than expected holiday sales 
the million increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to an increased store base and an increase in customer liabilities 
the million of cash generated from operations in fiscal was primarily the result of million of net income  million of non cash charges to net income  a million increase in accounts payable  an increase of million in accrued expenses and deferred rent  and a million increase in taxes payable  partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in merchandise inventories  a million increase in prepaid expenses  and a million increase in other long term assets

recent accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued statement of financial standards sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement establishes standards for accounting for an obligation associated with the retirement of a long lived asset 
the statement is effective for our fiscal year ending january  we are finalizing our review of this statement and are not expecting a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  and are not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the disclosure requirements of this interpretation were effective on december  the disclosure requirements have been adopted and are included in note to the consolidated financial statements  guarantees 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
we adopted the disclosure requirement in this form k 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities which addresses consolidation by businesses of variable interest entities 
we do not anticipate any impact from this interpretation 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the following policies to be most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
inventory valuation merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the cost is determined principally by a weighted average method 
the weighted average cost method attaches a cost to each sku  and is a blended average of the original purchase price and those of subsequent purchases or other cost adjustments throughout the life cycle of that sku 
inherent in the video game business is the risk of obsolete inventory 
as the new generation of products is introduced  demand for the prior generation decreases  thus reducing interest and value of the older games 
some vendors offer us credit to reduce the cost of products that are selling more slowly thus allowing for a reduction in the selling price and reducing the possibility for items to become obsolete 
we monitor the aging of our inventory by item and provide a reserve for product that is considered slow moving  using an established formula based on current inventory and a trailing sales history 
we also monitor the difference between the selling market price of each item and its cost and provide a reserve for any differences below such cost 
we perform regular physical inventories and cycle counts in both our stores and distribution centers to adjust inventory balances and account for shrink and damaged product 
an accrual for estimated loss is recorded between the timing of these counts 
reserves of million and million were recorded against inventory as of february  and february   respectively 
management believes its inventory valuation system results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
revenue recognition and related policies we derive revenue primarily from two sources i product revenue  which includes the retail sale of merchandise inventory  warranties  and shipping and handling fees and ii management services revenue 
sales are recorded net of estimated amounts for sales returns and other allowances 
retail sales are recognized as revenue at the point of sale 
mail order and internet sales are recognized as revenue upon delivery to and acceptance by the customer 
revenues from shipping and handling are recorded in revenue and recognized upon shipment 
warranty revenue is amortized over the life of the warranty contract 
we also engage in the sale and trading of pre owned video game products 
effective in the second quarter of fiscal  electronics boutique changed the income statement classification for pre owned merchandise trade in activity to be consistent with industry practice 
previously  we recorded a reduction to both revenue and cost of goods sold for the cost of the pre owned merchandise accepted for trade 
the reclassification of these transactions increased both revenues and cost of goods sold by million for the fifty three week period ended february  and million for the fifty two week period ended february  there was no impact on operating income or net income for any period as a result of this reclassification 
revenues for management services are recorded as earned 
in fiscal  all management fees earned were derived under service agreements with game group and scac 
restructuring costs in february  we announced our plan to close all of our eb kids stores and sell our store bc sports collectibles business 
in fiscal  we recorded a restructuring and asset impairment charge of million 
the charge represents a million write down of store leasehold improvements  a million write down of store furniture  fixtures and equipment and million in lease termination costs 
in fiscal  a million net reversal of the restructuring and asset impairment charge resulted primarily from store lease related accruals that were not necessary due to the terms of the sale of the bc sports collectibles business 
effective as of the close of business on november   we closed on the sale transaction of the bc sports collectibles business to scac for million in cash and the assumption of the lease related liabilities for each of its stores 
the family of james kim  who is chairman of electronics boutique and a significant investor in our outstanding common stock  owns scac 
the transaction included the sale of all assets of the business including inventory  intellectual property and furniture  fixtures and equipment  and transitional services which were provided to scac for a six month period after the closing for an additional  subsequent to year end  all of the store leases have been assigned to scac 
we remain contingently liable for these leases and mr 
kim has entered into an indemnification agreement with us for these leases 
the purchase agreement provides scac the right  exercisable at any time after the second anniversary of the closing date  to assign back to us two of the store leases 
we have retained an accrual of  for the estimated lease termination costs related to this option 
these actual costs could be higher than this amount 
income taxes we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions  including the united states  states and localities  and internationally 
income taxes are calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax law and published guidance with respect to applicability to our operations 
significant examples of this concept include capitalization policies for various tangible and intangible costs  income and expense recognition and inventory valuation methods 
we must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish valuation allowances 
we have valuation allowances of  and  as of february  and february   respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize the net operating loss carry forwards of certain foreign subsidiaries 
future tax expense may be impacted by this judgment 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets to determine if any part of the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important when assessing impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of an identifiable intangible or long lived asset may not be recoverable based on one or more of the above indicators  we test for impairment to determine if an impairment charge is needed 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment 
we use a two step impairment assessment to determine if an impairment charge is needed 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss if any 
electronics boutique has completed the annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal and no charges were required 
net intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill amounted to million as of february  see note to the consolidated financials statements for more details 
contractual obligations we have certain commitments under our operating leases which are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
furthermore  for information with respect to our debt and lines of credit  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term investment grade securities  generally with maturities of days or less 
in addition  our revolving credit facility provides for borrowings which bear interest at variable rates based on either the bank s base rate or libor plus basis points  at our option 
we had no borrowings outstanding pursuant to the revolving credit facility as of february  we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows should not be material 
we have retail operations in various foreign countries including australia  canada  denmark  germany  italy  new zealand  norway  south korea and sweden 
we are subject to currency exchange rate and currency devaluation risks due to these operations 
since approximately of our net sales are domestic  we do not believe that currency exchange rate fluctuations will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we routinely enter into forward and cross currency swap exchange contracts in the regular course of business to manage exposure against foreign currency fluctuations on intercompany loans  investments in subsidiaries  and accounts payable 
as of february   we have foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of million and cross currency swap contracts with a notional amount of million 
the total fair market value of all contracts is a deficit of approximately million 
four contracts for million expire during fiscal and the remaining contracts for million expire in future years 
we intend to monitor our exposure to these risks and re evaluate our hedging strategies as appropriate 
the table below provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments by functional currency and presents such information in us dollar equivalents 
the table summarizes information on instruments and transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates  including foreign currency forward exchange agreements and cross currency swap agreements
