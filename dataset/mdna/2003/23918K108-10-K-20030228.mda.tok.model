the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and item business 
results of operations our operating results  excluding prior period service recoveries  for the year ended december  were in line with our projected range  with no significant unanticipated changes in dialysis revenue  expense trends or ebitda  and no material changes in our general risk assessments 
however  positive developments regarding disputed medicare claims at our florida laboratory have allowed us to recognize medicare lab revenue for current and prior services beginning in the third quarter of the following is a summary of continental u

b excludes approximately and million of recoveries in and of amounts reserved in operating income as presented also excludes and million of prior years services revenues in and because of the inherent uncertainties associated with predicting third party reimbursements in the healthcare industry  our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks 
such risks and uncertainties are addressed in aicpa statement of position sop no 
auditing health care third party revenues and related receivables 
our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgement as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the reporting date 
changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends  or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies 
the net operating revenues for continental us operations of  million in and  million in represent annual increases of million or and million or  respectively 
approximately and of the increase in dialysis services revenue for and was attributable to increases in the average reimbursement rate per treatment and approximately and was due to an increase in the number of dialysis treatments 
the increase in also included approximately million of current year medicare laboratory revenue 
as discussed below  we had not recognized any medicare laboratory revenue during due to the ongoing dispute with the third party carrier 
dialysis services revenue dialysis services revenue  excluding prior period service revenue  represented  and of current operating revenues in  and  respectively 
lab  other and management fee income account for the balance of revenues 
dialysis services include outpatient center hemodialysis  which accounts for approximately of total dialysis treatments  home dialysis  and inpatient hemodialysis with contracted hospitals 
major components of dialysis revenue include the administration of epo and other drugs as part of the dialysis treatment  which represents approximately of operating revenues 
dialysis services are paid for primarily by medicare and state medicaid programs in accordance with rates established by cms  and by other third party payors such as hmo s and health insurance carriers 
services provided to patients covered by third party insurance companies are normally reimbursed at rates higher than medicare or medicaid rates 
patients covered by employer group health plans convert to medicare after a maximum of months 
as of year end  the medicare esrd dialysis treatment rates were between and per treatment  or an overall average of per treatment  excluding the administration of drugs 
the majority of our net earnings from dialysis services are derived from commercial payors  some of which pay at negotiated reimbursement rates and others which pay based on our usual and customary rates 
the commercial reimbursement rates are under continual pressure as we negotiate contract rates with large hmo s and insurance carriers 
additionally  as a patient transitions from commercial coverage to medicare or medicaid coverage  the reimbursement rates generally decline substantially 
dialysis services revenues by payor type were as follows year ended december  percent of total dialysis revenue medicare medicaid hmo s  health insurance carriers and private patient payments the average dialysis revenue recognized per treatment excluding prior years services revenue was  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in average dialysis revenue per treatment in was principally due to increases in our standard fee schedules impacting non contract commercial revenue  changes in mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals  continued improvements in revenue capture  billing and collecting operations  and payor contracting 
the increase in was principally due to continued improvements in revenue realization due to improved clinical operations and billing and collection processes  and a increase in the medicare composite reimbursement rates 
the number of dialysis treatments increased in and in  principally attributable to a non acquired annual growth rate of approximately for both years 
we continue to expect the non acquired growth rate to remain in the range of to through acquisitions accounted for the balance of the increases in treatment volumes 
the prior years services revenue of million in related to cash recoveries associated with prior years services and resulted from improvements in the company s billing and collecting operations 
lab and other services as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements contingencies  our florida based laboratory subsidiary has been under an ongoing third party carrier review for medicare reimbursement claims since prior to the third quarter  no medicare payments had been received since may following a favorable ruling by an administrative law judge in june relating to review periods from january to march  the carrier began releasing funds for lab services provided subsequent to may during the fourth quarter of  the carrier also released funds related to review periods from april through may during the second half of  the carrier paid us a total of million  representing approximately of the total outstanding prior medicare lab billings for the period from january through june approximately million of these collections related to lab services provided through june we have recognized prior period services medicare lab revenue as payments have been received based on our belief that the cumulative recoveries do not exceed the aggregate amount that we will ultimately recover and retain upon final review and settlement of the medicare billings 
at this time we expect no significant additional medicare lab payments relating to prior periods unless and until the dispute over the remaining disallowed claims are resolved in our favor 
in addition to the prior period claims  the carrier also began processing billings for current period services in the third quarter of as a result  in addition to the million of medicare lab revenue related to the first half of  we recognized approximately million of current period medicare lab revenue in the second half of management fee income management fee income represented less than of total revenues for and our fees are typically based on a percentage of revenue of the center that we manage and are established in the management contract 
we managed and third party dialysis centers as of year end and dialysis centers and lab expenses operating expenses consist of costs and expenses specifically attributable to the operations of dialysis centers and labs  including direct labor  drugs  medical supplies and other patient care service and support costs 
dialysis centers and lab operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenue excluding prior period services revenue were  and for  and  respectively 
on a per treatment basis  the operating expenses increased approximately and in and the increase in both years was principally due to higher labor and pharmaceutical costs  as well as revenue impacting changes in the mix of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals 
increases in revenue per treatment substantially offset these cost increases 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist of those costs not specifically attributable to the dialysis centers and labs and include expenses for corporate and regional administration  including centralized accounting  billing and cash collection functions 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues excluding prior period services revenue were approximately  and in  and  respectively 
in absolute dollars  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million in the increase was principally due to higher labor costs  continued investments in infrastructure to develop new operating and billing systems  and higher legal costs relating to the laboratory and us attorney s reviews see discussion of contingencies below and other proactive compliance initiatives 
provision for uncollectible accounts receivable 
the provision for and  net of recoveries  was million and a net recovery of million 
before considering cash recoveries and excluding prior period services revenue  the provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable were approximately of current operating revenues in as compared to in and in during and  we realized recoveries of million and million associated with aged accounts receivables that had been reserved in the recoveries and lower provisions in and resulted from continued improvements that we made in our billing and collecting processes 
impairments and valuation adjustments 
we perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment  amortizable intangibles  and investments in and advances to third party dialysis businesses whenever a change in condition indicates that a review is warranted 
such changes include changes in our business strategy and plans  the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners  or when an owned or third party dialysis business experiences deteriorating operating performance or liquidity problems 
goodwill is routinely assessed for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies 
impairments and valuation adjustments for consisted of a net loss of approximately million associated with continental us operations and a net gain of approximately million associated with the sale of our remaining non continental us operations 
other income loss the net of other income and loss items were income of million for  million for and a loss of million in interest income was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in  we had losses of million related to the settlement of a securities lawsuit and the recognition of the foreign currency translation loss associated with the divestitures of the non continental us operations 
debt expense debt expense for  and consisted of interest expense of approximately  and million respectively  and the amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately million in both and and million in the slight reduction in interest expense in was the result of lower average interest rates offset by higher debt balances due to our debt restructuring and common stock purchases that occurred as part of our recapitalization plan  as discussed below 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for represented an effective tax rate of as compared to in and in the reduction in the effective tax rate in compared to was primarily due to overall lower state income tax rates  the elimination of book amortization not deductible for tax purposes and changes in tax valuation estimates 
the high effective rate in resulted from the relatively low level of pre tax earnings in relation to significant permanent differences in  including non deductible amortization and deferred tax valuation allowances 
extraordinary items in  the extraordinary loss of million  net of tax  related to our recapitalization plan which included retiring all our million outstanding senior subordinated notes due and extinguishing our then existing senior credit facilities  as discussed below 
in  the extraordinary gain of million  net of tax  related to the write off of deferred financing costs offset by the accelerated recognition of deferred interest rate swap liquidation gains as a result of debt refinancing 
in  the extraordinary loss of million  net of tax  related to the write off of deferred financing costs associated with an early extinguishment of debt 
in july  we restructured our revolving and term credit facilities 
projections for our current projections for  based on current conditions and trends  are for normal operating earnings before depreciation and amortization  debt expense and taxes  or ebitda  to be in the range of million to million 
these projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties  and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections 
these risks  among others  include those relating to possible reductions in private and government reimbursement rates  the concentration of profits generated from non governmental payors and from the administration of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals  changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns or reimbursement policies  and the ongoing review by the united states attorney s office and the oig 
additionally  the termination or restructuring of managed care contracts  medical director agreements or other arrangements may result in future impairments or otherwise negatively affect our operating results 
we undertake no duty to update these projections  whether due to changes in current or expected trends  underlying market conditions  decisions of the united states attorney s office  the doj or the oig in any pending or future review of our business  or otherwise 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations during amounted to million which included million of prior period services recoveries 
the non operating cash flows were primarily associated with our recapitalization plan to restructure our debt and repurchase common stock  as discussed below  and a net investment of million in acquisitions and new center developments  system infrastructure and other capital assets 
during operating cash flow amounted to million  which included million of prior period services recoveries 
non operating cash flows for included a net million for acquisitions and capital asset expenditures  and million in stock repurchases 
in the first quarter of  we initiated a recapitalization plan to restructure our debt and repurchase common stock 
in april  we completed the initial phase of the recapitalization plan by retiring all of our million outstanding senior subordinated notes due for million 
concurrent with the retirement of this debt  we secured a new senior credit facility agreement in the amount of billion 
the excess of the consideration paid over the book value of the senior subordinated notes and write off of deferred financing costs associated with extinguishing the existing senior credit facilities and the notes resulted in an extraordinary loss of million  net of tax 
in june  we completed the next phase of the recapitalization plan with the repurchase of  shares of our common stock for approximately million  or per share  through a modified dutch auction tender offer 
in may  our board of directors authorized the purchase of an additional million of common stock over the next eighteen months 
as of december    shares had been acquired for million under this authorization 
no additional purchases have been made under this authorization since december for the year ended december   stock repurchases  including  shares acquired prior to initiating the recapitalization plan  amounted to million for  shares  for a composite average of per share 
the new senior credit facility secured during the second quarter of consists of a term loan a for million  a term loan b for million and a million undrawn revolving credit facility  which includes up to million available for letters of credit 
during the second quarter of  we borrowed all million of the term loan b  and million of the term loan b remained outstanding as of december  the term loan b bears interest equal to libor plus  which was a weighted average rate of as of december  the interest rates under the term loan a  which was fully drawn during january  and the revolving credit facility are equal to libor plus a margin ranging from to based on our leverage ratio 
the current margin is for an effective rate of 
the aggregate annual principal payments for the entire outstanding term credit facility range from million to million in years one through five  and million in each of years six and seven  with the balance due not later than the new senior credit facility is secured by all our personal property and that of all our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the new senior credit facility also contains financial and operating covenants including investment limitations 
during the second quarter of we issued million of senior subordinated notes and completed a refinancing of our senior credit facilities 
the net proceeds of these transactions were used to pay down amounts outstanding under our then existing senior credit facilities 
the new senior credit facilities consisted of two term loans totaling million as of december  and a million revolving credit facility undrawn as of december  
total outstanding debt amounted to million at december   a reduction of million during the year 
in  we negotiated a major restructuring of the credit facility and we were able to reduce the total outstanding debt by over million from our operating cash flows and the proceeds from divesting our non continental operations 
the continental us accounts receivable balance at december  and represented approximately and days of net revenue  net of bad debt provision 
during we increased our capital expenditures by approximately million over  principally for new dialysis centers  relocations and expansions  and for major information technology systems and upgrades 
we acquired a total of centers and opened new centers 
we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and operating cash flows to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations over the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations in addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet  we have commitments associated with operating leases  letters of credit and our investments in third party dialysis businesses 
nearly all of our facilities are leased 
we have potential acquisition obligations for several jointly owned centers  in the form of put options exercisable at the third party owners discretion 
these put obligations require us to purchase the third party owners interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow 
the following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of december  s within one year years years after years total scheduled payments under contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases potential cash requirements under existing commitments letters of credit acquisition of dialysis centers working capital advances to managed and minority owned centers contingencies health care provider revenues may be subject to adjustment as a result of examination by government agencies or contractors  for which the resolution of any matters raised may take extended periods of time to finalize  differing interpretations of government regulations by different fiscal intermediaries or regulatory authorities  differing opinions regarding a patient s medical diagnosis or the medical necessity of services provided  retroactive applications or interpretations of governmental requirements  and claims for refunds from private payors 
our florida based laboratory subsidiary is the subject of a third party carrier review of its medicare reimbursement claims 
the carrier has reviewed claims for six separate review periods 
in the carrier issued a formal overpayment determination in the amount of million for the first review period january to april 
the carrier also suspended all payments of medicare claims from the laboratory beginning in may in  the carrier issued a formal overpayment determination in the amount of million for the second review period may to march 
subsequently  the carrier informed us that million of the suspended claims for the third review period april to august  million of the suspended claims for the fourth review period august to may  million of the suspended claims for the fifth review period june to december and million of the suspended claims for the sixth review period december through may were not properly supported by the prescribing physicians medical justification 
the carrier s allegations regarding improperly supported claims represented approximately     and  respectively  of the tests the laboratory billed to medicare for these six review periods 
we have disputed each of the carrier s determinations and have provided supporting documentation of our claims 
in addition to the formal appeal processes with the carrier and a federal administrative law judge  we also pursued resolution of this matter through meetings with representatives of the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  and the department of justice  or doj 
we initially met with the doj in february  at which time the doj requested additional information  which we provided in september in june an administrative law judge ruled that the sampling procedures and extrapolations that the carrier used as the basis of its overpayment determinations for the first two review periods were invalid 
this decision invalidated the carrier s overpayment determinations for the first two review periods 
the administrative law judge s decision on the first two review periods does not apply to the remaining four review periods  as each review period is evaluated independently 
moreover  the carrier s sampling procedures have varied from period to period  and the conclusions the judge arrived at with respect to the first two periods may not hold for the subsequent periods 
the hearings before a carrier hearing officer for the third and fourth review periods are scheduled to take place in the second quarter of during we stopped accruing medicare revenue from this laboratory because of the uncertainties regarding both the timing of resolution and the ultimate revenue valuations 
following the favorable ruling by the administrative law judge in related to the first two review periods covering january to march  the carrier lifted the payment suspension and began making payments in july for lab services provided subsequent to may after making its determination with respect to the fifth and sixth review periods in december  the carrier paid the additional amounts that it is not disputing for the second through sixth review periods 
as of december   we had received a total of million  which represented approximately of the total outstanding medicare lab billings for the period from january through june approximately million of these collections related to lab services provided through june these cash collections were recognized as revenue in the quarter received 
we will continue to recognize medicare lab revenue associated with prior periods as cash collections actually occur  to the extent that cumulative recoveries do not exceed the aggregate amount that management believes we will ultimately recover upon final review and settlement of disputed billings 
in addition to processing prior period claims during the third quarter of  the carrier also began processing billings for current period services on a timely basis 
based on these developments  we began recognizing estimated current period medicare lab revenue in the third quarter of as a result  in addition to the million of medicare lab revenue related to the first half of  we recognized approximately million of current period medicare lab revenue in the second half of the carrier is also currently conducting a study of the utilization of dialysis related laboratory services 
during the study  the carrier has suspended all of its previously existing dialysis laboratory prepayment screens 
the purpose of the study is to determine what ongoing program safeguards are appropriate 
in its initial findings from the study  the carrier had determined that some of its prior prepayment screens were invalidating appropriate claims 
we cannot determine what prepayment screens  post payment review procedures  documentation requirements or other program safeguards the carrier may yet implement as a result of its study 
the carrier has also informed us that any claims that it reimburses during the study period may also be subject to post payment review and refund if determined inappropriate 
the medicare carrier for our minnesota laboratory is conducting a post payment review of medicare reimbursement claims for the period january through december the scope of the review is similar to the review being conducted at our florida laboratory 
at this time  we are unable to determine how long it will take the carrier to complete this review 
there is currently no overpayment determination or payment suspension with respect to the minnesota laboratory 
the doj also requested information with respect to this laboratory  which we have provided 
medicare revenues at the minnesota laboratory  which was much smaller than the florida laboratory  were approximately million for the period under review 
in november  we closed the operations of this laboratory and combined them with our florida laboratory 
in february the civil division of the united states attorney s office for the eastern district of pennsylvania in philadelphia contacted us and requested our cooperation in a review of some of our historical practices  including billing and other operating procedures and our financial relationships with physicians 
we cooperated in this review and provided the requested records to the united states attorney s office 
in may  we received a subpoena from the philadelphia office of the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services  or oig 
the subpoena requires an update to the information we provided in our response to the february request  and also seeks a wide range of documents relating to pharmaceutical and other ancillary services provided to patients  including laboratory and other diagnostic testing services  as well as documents relating to our financial relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies 
the subpoena covers the period from may to may we have provided the documents requested 
this inquiry remains at an early stage 
as it proceeds  the government could expand its areas of concern 
if a court determines that there has been wrongdoing  the penalties under applicable statutes could be substantial 
in addition to the foregoing  we are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business 
management believes that the ultimate resolution of these additional pending proceedings  whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting estimates and judgements our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates  judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets  liabilities  and contingencies 
all significant estimates  judgements and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary 
actual results will generally differ from these estimates 
changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends  or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies 
interim changes in estimates are generally applied prospectively within annual periods 
certain accounting estimates  including those concerning revenue recognition and provision for uncollectible accounts  impairments and valuation adjustments  and accounting for income taxes  are considered to be critical in evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgements and estimates 
revenue recognition and provision for uncollectible accounts revenues are recognized as services are provided to patients 
operating revenues consist primarily of reimbursement for dialysis and ancillary services to patients 
a usual and customary fee schedule is maintained for our dialysis treatment and other patient services  however  actual collectible revenue is normally at a discount to the fee schedule 
medicare and medicaid programs are billed at pre determined net realizable rates per treatment that are established by statute or regulation 
most non governmental payors  including contracted managed care payors  are billed at our usual and customary rates  but a contractual allowance is recorded to adjust to the expected net realizable revenue for services provided 
contractual allowances along with provisions for uncollectible accounts are estimated based upon credit risks of third party payors  contractual terms  inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes  regulatory compliance issues and historical collection experience 
revenue recognition uncertainties inherent in the company s operations are addressed in aicpa statement of position sop no 
auditing health care third party revenues and related receivables 
as addressed in sop no 
 net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will actually be realized considering  among other items  retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews  audits  billing reviews and other matters 
lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received after considering possible retroactive adjustments that may be made as a result of the ongoing third party carrier review 
prior period services medicare lab revenue is currently being recognized as cash collections actually occur  to the extent that the cumulative recoveries do not exceed the aggregate amount that we believe we will ultimately realize upon final review and settlement of the third party carrier s review 
impairments of long lived assets we account for impairment of long lived assets  which include property and equipment  investments  amortizable intangible assets and goodwill  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets or sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  as applicable 
an impairment review is performed annually or whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable 
such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans  changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers 
we use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use 
such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized  as well as market values and conditions 
the computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions 
any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value 
accounting for income taxes we estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements using current enacted tax laws 
deferred tax assets must be assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
the allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgement about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets 
these calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgements because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain or future events unpredictable 
variable compensation accruals we estimate variable compensation accruals monthly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain employee specific and or corporate financial and operating goals 
our estimates  which include compensation incentives for bonuses  awards and benefit plan contributions  are updated periodically due to changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award 
actual results may vary due to the subjective nature of fulfilling employee specific and or corporate goals as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by the company s board of directors 
significant new accounting standards for statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets became effective in under sfas no 
 beginning in goodwill is no longer amortized  but is required to be assessed for possible valuation impairment as circumstances warrant and at least annually 
an impairment charge must be recorded against current earnings to the extent that the book value of goodwill exceeds its fair value 
we recognized no goodwill impairments upon transition to this standard 
if this standard had been implemented at the beginning of  amortization expense would have been reduced by million and million  net of tax  for and net income and diluted net income per share would have been approximately million or per share and million or per share for and  respectively 
sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets became effective in sfas no 
superceded sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
allows different approaches in cash flow estimation  and extends discontinued operations treatment  previously applied only to operating segments  to more discrete business components 
the impairment model under sfas no 
is otherwise largely unchanged from sfas no 
 and adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
sfas no 
rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections will be effective for under sfas no 
 gains or losses from extinguishment of debt will no longer be classified as extraordinary items  but will be included as a component of income from continuing operations 
all comparable prior period extraordinary items will be reclassified for consistent presentation 
although the million of extraordinary loss  net of tax  for will be reclassified in future financial statements as million of ordinary expense before taxes  this classification change will have no impact on net income or net income per share 
fasb interpretation no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others was issued in november this interpretation clarifies the requirements for a guarantor s disclosures in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued and which remain outstanding 
the interpretation also clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of a liability for the fair value of an obligation undertaken by the guarantor at the inception of the guarantee  including its ongoing obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event that the specified triggering events or conditions occur 
the disclosure requirements are currently effective  while the recognition and initial measurement provisions will apply to guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not believe that these provisions will have a material impact on our financial statements 
sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which was issued in december  provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and also requires disclosures in interim as well as annual financial statements regarding our method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results

we base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us  and we do not intend to update these statements  whether as a result of changes in underlying factors  new information  future events or other developments 
these statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties  including risks resulting from economic and market conditions  the regulatory environment in which we operate  competitive activities and other business conditions 
our actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in these forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements include those set forth below 
the risks discussed below are not the only ones facing our business 
if the percentage of our collections at or near our billed prices declines  then our revenues  cash flows and earnings would be substantially reduced 
approximately of our continental us dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have private payors as the primary payor 
a minority of these patients have insurance policies that reimburse us at or near our billed prices  which are significantly higher than medicare rates 
the majority of these patients have insurance policies that reimburse us at lower rates but  in most cases  higher than medicare rates 
we believe that pressure from private payors to decrease the rates they pay us may increase 
if the percentage of collections at or near our billed prices decreases significantly  it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues  cash flows and earnings 
if the percentage of patients with insurance paying at or near our billed prices declines  then our revenues  cash flows and earnings would be substantially reduced 
our revenue levels are sensitive to the mix of reimbursements from higher paying commercial plans to total reimbursements from all payor plans and program types 
if there is a significant change in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans relative to plans that pay at lower rates  for example a reduction in the average number of patients under indemnity and ppo plans compared with the average number of patients under hmo plans and government programs  it would negatively impact our revenues  cash flows and earnings 
if we are unable to renegotiate material contracts with managed care plans on acceptable terms  we may experience a decline in same center growth 
we have contracts with some large managed care plans that include unfavorable terms 
although we are attempting to renegotiate the terms of these contracts  we cannot predict whether we will reach agreement on new terms or whether we will renew these contracts 
as a result  we may lose numerous patients of these managed care plans and experience a decline in our same center growth  which would negatively impact our revenues 
changes in clinical practices and reimbursement rates or rules for epo and other drugs could substantially reduce our revenue and earnings 
the administration of epo and other drugs accounts for approximately one third of our net operating revenues 
changes in physician practice patterns and accepted clinical practices  changes in private and governmental reimbursement rates and rules  the introduction of new drugs and the conversion to alternate types of administration  for example from intravenous administration to subcutaneous or oral administration  that may also result in lower or less frequent dosages  could reduce our revenues and earnings from the administration of epo and other drugs 
for example  some medicare fiscal intermediaries are seeking to implement local medical review policies for epo and vitamin d analogs that would effectively limit utilization of and reimbursement for these drugs 
future declines  or the lack of further increases  in medicare reimbursement rates would reduce our net income and cash flows 
approximately of our continental us dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have medicare as their primary payor 
the medicare esrd program reimburses us for dialysis and ancillary services at fixed rates 
unlike many other medicare programs  the medicare esrd program does not provide for periodic inflation increases in reimbursement rates 
increases of in and in were the first increases in the composite rate since  and were significantly less than the cumulative rate of inflation since there was no increase in the composite rate for increases in operating costs that are subject to inflation  such as labor and supply costs  have occurred and are expected to continue to occur with or without a compensating increase in reimbursement rates 
we cannot predict the nature or extent of future rate changes  if any 
to the extent these rates are not adjusted to keep pace with inflation  our net income and cash flows would be adversely affected 
future changes in the structure of  and reimbursement rates under  the medicare esrd program could substantially reduce our operating earnings and cash flows 
in legislation enacted in december  congress mandated government studies on whether the medicare composite rate for dialysis should be modified to include an annual inflation increase this study was due july  but has not yet been delivered to congress  the medicare composite rate for dialysis should be modified to include additional services  such as laboratory and other diagnostic tests and the administration of epo and other pharmaceuticals  in the composite rate this study was due july  but has not yet been delivered to congress  and reimbursement for many of the outpatient prescription drugs that we administer to dialysis patients should be changed from the historic rate of of the average wholesale price  or awp 
this study was delivered to congress but congress has not acted upon it 
if medicare began to include in its composite reimbursement rate any ancillary services that it currently reimburses separately  our revenue would decrease to the extent there was not a corresponding increase in that composite rate 
in particular  medicare revenue from epo is approximately of our total medicare revenue 
in january  cms implemented a new payment structure utilizing a single drug pricer for all drugs that medicare reimburses  including many we administer 
based on the initial prices cms has set  we do not expect our reimbursement under this single drug pricer in to differ materially from what it would have been under the awp based reimbursement structure 
we expect  however  that cms will change the prices set under this single drug pricer in the future or make other changes to the payment structure for these drugs 
if epo were included in the composite rate  and if the composite rate were not increased sufficiently  our operating earnings and cash flows could decrease substantially 
reductions in current reimbursement rates for epo or other outpatient prescription drugs would also reduce our net earnings and cash flows 
future declines in medicaid reimbursement rates would reduce our net income and cash flows 
approximately of our continental us dialysis revenues are generated from medicaid payors 
if state governments change medicaid programs or the rates paid by those programs for our services  then our revenue and earnings may decline 
some of the states medicaid programs have proposed eligibility changes or have announced that they are considering reductions in the rates for certain services 
any action to reduce the medicaid coverage rules or reimbursement rates for dialysis and related services would adversely affect our revenue and earnings 
if a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers  whether due to regulatory or other reasons  our revenue and earnings would decline 
if a significant number of physicians stop referring patients to our centers  it could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings 
many physicians prefer to have their patients treated at centers where they or other members of their practice supervise the overall care provided as medical directors of the centers 
as a result  the primary referral source for most of our centers is often the physician or physician group providing medical director services to the center 
if a medical director agreement terminates  whether before or at the end of its term  and a new medical director is appointed  it may negatively impact the former medical director s decision to treat his or her patients at our center 
additionally  the medical directors have no obligation to refer their patients to our centers 
our medical director contracts are for fixed periods  generally five to ten years 
medical directors have no obligation to extend their agreements with us 
in the twelve months ended december   we renewed the agreements with medical directors at centers 
in addition  as of december   there were additional centers at which the medical director agreements required renewal on or before december  we also may take actions to restructure existing relationships or take positions in negotiating extensions of relationships in order to assure compliance with anti kickback and similar laws 
these actions could negatively impact physicians decisions to extend their medical director agreements with us or to refer their patients to us 
in addition  if the terms of an existing agreement were found to violate applicable laws  we may not be successful in restructuring the relationship  which could lead to the early termination of the agreement  or force the physician to stop referring patients to the centers 
if the current shortage of skilled clinical personnel or our high level of personnel turnover continues  we may experience disruptions in our business operations and increases in operating expenses 
we are experiencing increased labor costs and difficulties in hiring nurses due to a nationwide shortage of skilled clinical personnel 
this shortage limits our ability to expand our operations 
we also have a high personnel turnover rate in our dialysis centers 
turnover has been the highest among our technicians  nurses and unit secretaries 
recent efforts to reduce this turnover may not succeed 
if we are not successful  or if we are unable to hire skilled clinical personnel when needed  our operations and our same center growth will be negatively impacted 
adverse developments with respect to epo could materially reduce our net income and cash flows and affect our ability to care for our patients 
amgen is the sole supplier of epo and may unilaterally decide to increase its price for epo at any time 
for example  amgen unilaterally increased its base price for epo by in each of  and also  we cannot predict whether we will continue to receive the same discount structure for epo that we currently receive  or whether we will continue to achieve the same levels of discounts within that structure as we have historically achieved 
in addition  amgen has developed a new product  aranesp  that may replace epo or reduce its use with dialysis patients 
we cannot predict if or when aranesp will be introduced to the us dialysis market  what its cost and reimbursement structure will be  or how it may impact our revenues from epo 
increases in the cost of epo and the introduction of aranesp could have a material adverse effect on our net income and cash flows 
the pending federal review of some of our historical practices and third party carrier review of our laboratory subsidiary could result in substantial penalties against us 
we are voluntarily cooperating with the civil division of the united states attorney s office and oig in philadelphia in a review of some of our practices  including billing and other operating procedures  financial relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies  and the provision of pharmaceutical and other ancillary services 
in addition  our florida laboratory and our now closed minnesota laboratory are each the subject of a third party carrier review of claims it has submitted for medicare reimbursement 
the doj has also requested and received information regarding these laboratories 
we are unable to determine when these matters will be resolved  whether any additional areas of inquiry will be opened or any outcome of these matters  financial or otherwise 
any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
if we fail to adhere to all of the complex government regulations that apply to our business  we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenue and earnings 
our dialysis operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local government regulations  including medicare and medicaid reimbursement rules and regulations  federal and state anti kickback laws  and federal and state laws regarding the collection  use and disclosure of patient health information 
the regulatory scrutiny of healthcare providers  including dialysis providers  has increased significantly in recent years 
in addition  the frequency and intensity of medicare certification surveys and inspections of dialysis centers has increased markedly since we endeavor to comply with all of the requirements for receiving medicare and medicaid reimbursement and to structure all of our relationships with referring physicians to comply with the anti kickback laws  however  the laws and regulations in this area are complex and subject to varying interpretations 
in addition  our historic dependence on manual processes that vary widely across our network of dialysis centers exposes us to greater risk of errors in billing and other business processes 
due to regulatory considerations unique to each of these states  all of our dialysis operations in new york and part of our dialysis operations in new jersey are conducted through privately owned companies to which we provide a broad range of administrative services 
these operations account for approximately of our continental us dialysis revenues 
we believe that we have structured these operations to comply with the laws and regulations of these states  but we can give no assurances that they will not be challenged 
if any of our operations are found to violate these or other government regulations  we could suffer severe consequences  including mandated practice changes that significantly increase operating expenses  suspension of payments from government reimbursement programs  refunds of amounts received in violation of law or applicable reimbursement program requirements  loss of required government certifications or exclusion from government reimbursement programs  loss of licenses required to operate healthcare facilities in some of the states in which we operate  fines or monetary penalties for anti kickback law violations  submission of false claims or other failures to meet reimbursement program requirements and patient privacy law violations  and claims for monetary damages from patients who believe their protected health information has been used or disclosed in violation of federal or state patient privacy laws 
our rollout of new information technology systems will significantly disrupt our billing and collection activity  may not work as planned and could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we will be continuing the rollout of new information technology systems and new processes to each of our dialysis centers over the next fifteen months 
it is likely that this rollout will disrupt our billing and collection activity and may cause other disruptions to our business operations  which may negatively impact our cash flows 
also  the new information systems may not work as planned or improve our billing and collection processes as expected 
if they do not  we may have to spend substantial amounts to enhance or replace these systems 
provisions in our charter documents and compensation programs we have adopted may deter a change of control that our stockholders would otherwise determine to be in their best interests 
our charter documents include provisions which may deter hostile takeovers  delay or prevent changes of control or changes in our management  or limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they may otherwise determine to be in their best interests 
these include provisions prohibiting our stockholders from acting by written consent  requiring days advance notice of stockholder proposals or nominations to our board of directors and granting our board of directors the authority to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without the need for further stockholder approval  and a poison pill that would substantially dilute the interest sought by an acquirer that our board of directors does not approve 
in addition  most of our outstanding employee stock options include a provision accelerating the vesting of the options in the event of a change of control 
we have also adopted a change of control protection program for our employees who do not have a significant number of stock options  which provides for cash bonuses to the employees in the event of a change of control 
based on the shares of our common stock outstanding and the market price of our stock on december   these cash bonuses would total approximately million 
these compensation programs may affect the price an acquirer would be willing to pay 
these provisions could also discourage bids for our common stock at a premium and cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for our debt obligations  the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on these obligations as of december  for our debt obligations with variable interest rates  the rates presented reflect the current rates in effect at the end of these rates are based on libor plus a margin of 
expected maturity date total fair value average interest rate thereafter dollars in millions long term debt fixed rate variable rate our senior credit facility is based on a floating libor interest rate plus a margin  which is reset periodically and can be locked in for a maximum of six months 
as a result  our interest expense is subject to fluctuations as libor interest rates change 
one means of assessing exposure to interest rate changes is duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of basis points across all variable rate maturities sometimes referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve 
under this model  with all else constant  it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately million  million and million  net of tax  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company does not currently use any derivative financial instruments to hedge against interest rate exposure 
exchange rate sensitivity we are currently not exposed to any foreign currency exchange rate risk
