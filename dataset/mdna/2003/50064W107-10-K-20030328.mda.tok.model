critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our research and development collaborations  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies  which have been reviewed by our audit committee  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize license and other up front fees over the estimated research and development term of the respective agreement 
if the agreement does not have a specified research and development term  we must apply judgment in determining the appropriate level of recognition 
any changes in our estimates will result in either an acceleration or further deferral of related revenue recognition 
milestone payments are recognized upon successful completion of a specified scientific or regulatory milestone event 
contract revenues related to collaborative research and development agreements are recognized as revenues as the related services are performed 
such payments are generally made based on the number of full time equivalent researchers assigned to the collaboration project and as the related research and development expenses are incurred 
revenues related to government grant awards are recognized at the time a grant is awarded and as related research expenses are incurred 
any amounts received in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenue until earned 
stock based compensation we continue to account for common stock options granted to employees using the intrinsic value method and  thus  recognize compensation expense for options granted with exercise prices less than the fair value of our common stock on the date of the grant 
we disclose the fair value of such grants in the notes to the financial statements as currently permitted under statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
we recorded total deferred stock based compensation of approximately million in and million in  which is being amortized to expense using the graded vesting method over the vesting periods of the underlying options  generally four years 
subsequently  if employees terminate during the vesting period  adjustments of previous charges are recognized in the period of termination 
we expect to record amortization of deferred stock based compensation approximately as follows  in and  in stock based compensation expense for options granted to non employees has been determined as the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured 
we recognized other stock based compensation for non employees of approximately million in   in and million in in addition  assuming no changes  we expect to recognize other stock based compensation in connection with stock options granted to non employees of approximately  in   in   in and  in the measurement of stock based compensation to non employees is subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying securities vest 
as such  changes to these measurements could be substantial should we experience significant changes in our stock price 
see notes and of our financial statements 
investments we invest in debt and equity securities 
the price of these securities is subject to significant volatility 
we record an impairment charge when we believe that an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
generally  we review an investment for impairment if its market value has been below its carrying value for each trading day in a six month period 
clinical trial accruals over the next year our clinical trials of kos will significantly increase our research and development expenditures 
research and development expenditures are charged to operations as incurred 
our expenses related to clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on 
table of contents our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and variation from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events or the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
expenses related to clinical trials generally are accrued based on the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the protocol 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activity to the extent possible and adjust our estimates accordingly 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue 
our revenues increased to approximately million in from approximately million in this increase was primarily due to approximately million in contract revenue recognized under our development and commercialization agreement with roche  of which  represented the ratable portion of the first of two million installments of an initial fee that is being recognized over an estimated five year clinical development period 
in addition  we recognized approximately million in grant revenue in  compared to approximately million in total contract revenues under our collaboration agreement with j jprd were approximately million in  compared to approximately million in included in revenues was a non recurring  milestone payment received in connection with this collaboration 
in december  we amended our collaboration agreement with j jprd to extend the research program through at least december  subject to early termination provisions 
if we do not maintain or further extend our agreements with roche and j jprd  our revenues will significantly decrease unless we enter into additional collaborations that provide substantial revenues 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses consisted primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  stock based compensation  facility related expenses  licensing related expenses  depreciation of facilities and equipment  lab consumables  clinical trial related services performed by clinical research organizations and research institutions and other outside service providers 
research and development expenses increased to approximately million in from approximately million in this increase  partially offset by the decrease in stock based compensation in  was due in large part to our expanded research and development efforts  including three phase i studies of kos epothilone d  related licensing expenses and additional staffing in support of our continued investment in internally funded programs and technologies 
our research and development employees increased to in from in we expect our research and development expenses will increase substantially as kos advances further into the clinic and as we support our collaborative research and development programs and advance our in house research programs into later stages of development 
the table below summarizes the development status of our most advanced product candidates product candidate status commencement of current phase kos phase i clinical trials commenced clinical trials in the second half of aag phase i clinical trials nci commenced clinical trials in phase i clinical trials generally are expected to last between and months  phase ii clinical trials are expected to last between and months and phase iii clinical trials are expected to last between and months 
the length of clinical development depends on the specific disease and patient population 
for drug candidates that are in preclinical development  the timing of an investigational new drug filing varies significantly and is difficult to predict and therefore not reflected in the table above 

table of contents general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to approximately million in from approximately million in the decrease was due to the decrease in stock based compensation expense in  compared to  partially offset by higher employee related expenses to support our expanding research and development activities 
our general and administrative employees increased to in from in we expect our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support the continued growth of our research and development efforts 
interest income 
interest income decreased to approximately million in from approximately million in this decrease was attributable to lower average investment balances and lower investment yields associated with the declining interest rate environment 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to approximately  in from approximately  in this increase resulted from additional debt financing of property and equipment during we expect our interest expense will increase in the future resulting from additional property and equipment related debt financings 
gain loss on the recovery or write down of investment 
at june   we determined that an other than temporary decline in the fair value of our investment in short term commercial paper of southern california edison  or so cal ed  a utility company  had occurred 
at the time of purchase  the security was a high investment grade security  but was subsequently downgraded due to the financial uncertainty that resulted from the california energy crisis 
the security matured on april   and so cal ed defaulted on payment 
the amortized cost of the security was million  and the security was valued at approximately of cost at june  accordingly  for the quarter ended june   we recorded a write down on the carrying value of the investment of  in march  the security was fully repaid 
thus  we recorded a realized gain on the investment of  in years ended december  and revenue 
our revenues increased to approximately million in from approximately million in this increase was due to approximately million of grant revenue in  compared to approximately  in during the year ended december   we recognized a non recurring  milestone payment received in connection with our research collaboration with j jprd 
total contract revenues under this collaboration were approximately million in and approximately million in included in revenues was  in remaining amortization of the up front fee received in connection with this collaboration 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses consisted primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  stock based compensation  fees paid to outside service providers  facility related expenses  depreciation of facilities and equipment and lab consumables 
research and development expenses increased to approximately million in from approximately million in this increase was due in large part to our expanded research and development efforts  including advancing kos into the clinic  and continued investment in internally funded programs and technologies 
in addition  increased payroll and personnel related expenses contributed to the increase as the number of research and development employees increased to in from in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million in from approximately million in this increase was primarily due to higher employee related costs to support our expanding research and development activities and a full year of public company related expenses 
our general and administrative employees increased to in from in interest income 
interest income increased to approximately million in from approximately million in this increase was due to higher average investment balances due to aggregate net proceeds 
table of contents of approximately million received in connection with our october initial public offering of common stock and the issuance of series c convertible preferred stock in march interest expense 
interest expense decreased to approximately  in from approximately  in the decrease resulted from normal amortization of existing debt and a lower cost of capital on additional debt financing due to declining interest rates in beneficial conversion feature 
in march  we sold  shares of series c convertible preferred stock that converted into  shares of common stock at the closing of our initial public offering for net proceeds of approximately million 
after evaluating the fair value of our common stock in contemplation of our initial public offering  we determined that the issuance of the series c convertible preferred stock resulted in a beneficial conversion feature calculated in accordance with emerging issues task force consensus no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features 
the beneficial conversion feature was reflected as a deemed dividend of million in our financial statements in provision for income taxes we incurred net operating losses in the years ended december   and and consequently did not pay federal  state or foreign income taxes 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
if not utilized  the net operating losses and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through use of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
see note of our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations from inception primarily through sales of convertible preferred stock and common stock  totaling approximately million in net proceeds  contract payments under our collaboration agreements  equipment financing arrangements and government grant awards 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and investments  compared to approximately million as of december  our funds are currently invested in us treasury and government agency obligations and corporate obligations 
our operating activities used cash of approximately million in  compared to approximately million in our net loss of approximately million in was partially offset by the unrecognized portion of the first of two million installments of an initial fee from roche and non cash expenses of approximately million related to stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization expenses 
our net loss of approximately million in was partially offset by non cash charges of million related to stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization expenses 
our net loss of approximately million in was partially offset by non cash charges of approximately million related to stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization expenses 
our investing activities  excluding changes in our investments  for the year ended december   used cash of approximately million  compared to approximately million in  reflecting facility improvements and capital expenditures as we continued to enhance our laboratory capabilities 
investing activities in  excluding changes in our investments  used cash of approximately million to fund capital purchases and leasehold improvements 
cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately  in financing activities in included approximately 
table of contents million of equipment financing  which was partially offset by scheduled payments on new and existing debt 
financing activities in included approximately million of equipment financing  which was offset by scheduled payments on new and existing debt 
financing activities in included approximately million in net proceeds raised from our october initial public offering of common stock and approximately million in net proceeds from the issuance of our series c convertible preferred stock in march in april  we entered into a million equipment line of credit agreement for facility improvements and capital purchases 
as of december   we had utilized approximately million of the line of credit leaving approximately  available for future draws 
we believe that our existing cash  investments  and anticipated cash flow from existing collaborations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan into early our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to the following our ability to establish  and the scope of and revenues received under  any new collaborations  the progress and number of research programs carried out by us  the progress and success of preclinical and clinical trials of our drug candidates  our ability to maintain and extend our existing collaborations with roche and j jprd  the costs and timing of obtaining  enforcing and defending our patent and intellectual rights  the costs and timing of our facilities expansion  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  and expenses associated with unforeseen litigation 
in addition  we review from time to time potential opportunities to expand our technologies or add to our portfolio of drug candidates 
in the future  we may need further capital in order to acquire or invest in technologies  products or businesses 
we expect that additional financing will be required in the future to fund operations 
we expect to finance future cash needs through the sale of equity securities  strategic collaborations  government grant awards and debt financing 
additional financing or collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available when needed or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs  to lose rights under existing licenses or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if additional funds are obtained by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
in addition  see item business risk factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition 
our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements  and under contingent commitments are as follows payments due by period total year years less than years after years in thousands equipment financing obligations operating leases contingent commitments total contractual cash obligations 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investments to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and investment grade corporate obligations 
at december   we had approximately million invested in short term commercial paper of southern california edison  or so cal ed  a utility company
