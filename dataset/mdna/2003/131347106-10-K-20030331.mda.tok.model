government regulation we are subject to complex and stringent energy  environmental and other governmental laws and regulations at the federal  state and local levels in connection with the development  ownership and operation of our energy generation facilities 
federal laws and regulations govern transactions by electric and gas utility companies  the types of fuel which may be utilized by an electricity generating plant  the type of energy which may be produced by such a plant  the ownership of a plant  and access to and service on the transmission grid 
in most instances  public utilities that serve retail customers are subject to rate regulation by the state utility regulatory commission 
the state utility regulatory commission is often primarily responsible for determining whether a public utility may recover the costs of wholesale electricity purchases or other supply related activity through retail rates that the public utility may charge its customers 
the state utility regulatory commission may  from time to time  impose restrictions or limitations on the manner in which a public utility may transact with wholesale power sellers  such as independent power producers 
under certain circumstances where specific exemptions are otherwise unavailable  state utility regulatory commissions may have broad jurisdiction over non utility electric power plants 
energy producing projects also are subject to federal  state and local laws and administrative regulations which govern the emissions and other substances produced  discharged or disposed of by a plant and the geographical location  zoning  land use and operation of a plant 
applicable federal environmental laws typically have both state and local enforcement and implementation provisions 
these environmental laws and regulations generally require that a wide variety of permits and other approvals be obtained before the commencement of construction or operation of an energy producing facility and that the facility then operate in compliance with such permits and approvals 
federal energy regulation purpa the enactment of the public utility regulatory policies act of  as amended purpa and the adoption of regulations thereunder by the ferc provided incentives for the development of cogeneration facilities and small power production facilities those utilizing renewable fuels and having a capacity of less than megawatts 

table of contents a domestic electricity generating project must be a qualifying facility qf under ferc regulations in order to take advantage of certain rate and regulatory incentives provided by purpa 
purpa exempts owners of qfs from the public utility holding company act of  as amended puhca  and exempts qfs from most provisions of the federal power act fpa and  except under certain limited circumstances  state laws concerning rate or financial regulation 
these exemptions are important to us and our competitors 
we believe that each of the electricity generating projects in which we own an interest and which operates as a qf power producer currently meets the requirements under purpa necessary for qf status 
purpa provides two primary benefits to qfs 
first  qfs generally are relieved of compliance with extensive federal and state regulations that control the financial structure of an electricity generating plant and the prices and terms on which electricity may be sold by the plant 
second  ferc s regulations promulgated under purpa require that electric utilities purchase electricity generated by qfs at a price based on the purchasing utility s avoided cost  and that the utility sell back up power to the qf on a non discriminatory basis 
the term avoided cost is defined as the incremental cost to an electric utility of electric energy or capacity  or both  which  but for the purchase from qfs  such utility would generate for itself or purchase from another source 
ferc regulations also permit qfs and utilities to negotiate agreements for utility purchases of power at rates lower than the utilities avoided costs 
while public utilities are not explicitly required by purpa to enter into long term power sales agreements  purpa helped to create a regulatory environment in which it has been common for long term agreements to be negotiated 
in order to be a qf  a cogeneration facility must produce not only electricity  but also useful thermal energy for use in an industrial or commercial process for heating or cooling applications in certain proportions to the facilities total energy output  and must meet certain energy efficiency standards 
a geothermal facility may qualify as a qf if it produces less than megawatts of electricity 
finally  a qf including a geothermal qf or other qualifying small power producer must not be controlled or more than owned by one or more electric utilities or by most electric utility holding companies  or one or more subsidiaries of such a utility or holding company or any combination thereof 
we endeavor to develop our projects  monitor compliance by the projects with applicable regulations and choose our customers in a manner which minimizes the risks of any project losing its qf status 
certain factors necessary to maintain qf status are  however  subject to the risk of events outside our control 
for example  loss of a thermal energy customer or failure of a thermal energy customer to take required amounts of thermal energy from a cogeneration facility that is a qf could cause the facility to fail requirements regarding the level of useful thermal energy output 
upon the occurrence of such an event  we would seek to replace the thermal energy customer or find another use for the thermal energy which meets purpa s requirements  but no assurance can be given that this would be possible 
if one of the facilities in which we have an interest should lose its status as a qf  the project would no longer be entitled to the exemptions from puhca and the fpa 
this could also trigger certain rights of termination under the facility s power sales agreement  could subject the facility to rate regulation as a public utility under the fpa and state law and could result in us inadvertently becoming an electric utility holding company by owning more than of the voting securities of  or controlling  a facility that would no longer be exempt from puhca 
this could cause all of our remaining projects to lose their qualifying status  because qfs may not be controlled or more than owned by such electric utility holding companies 
loss of qf status may also trigger defaults under covenants to maintain qf status in the projects power sales agreements  steam sales agreements and financing agreements and result in termination  penalties or acceleration of indebtedness under such agreements such that loss of status may be on a retroactive or a prospective basis 
under the energy policy act of  if a facility can be qualified as an exempt wholesale generator ewg  meaning that all of its output is sold for resale rather than to end users  it will be exempt from puhca even if it does not qualify as a qf 
therefore  another response to the loss or potential loss of qf status would be to apply to have the project qualified as an ewg 
however  assuming this changed status would be permissible under the terms of the applicable power sales agreement  rate approval from ferc would be required 
in addition  the facility would be required to cease selling electricity to any retail customers 
table of contents such as the thermal energy customer to retain its ewg status and could become subject to state regulation of sales of thermal energy 
see public utility holding company regulation 
currently  congress is considering proposed legislation that would repeal puhca and amend purpa by limiting its mandatory purchase obligation to existing contracts 
in light of the circumstances in california  the pacific gas and electric company pg e bankruptcy and the enron bankruptcy  among other events in recent years  there are a number of federal legislative and regulatory initiatives that could result in changes in how the energy markets are regulated 
we do not know whether this legislation or regulatory initiatives will be adopted or  if adopted  what form they may take 
we cannot provide assurance that any legislation or regulation ultimately adopted would not adversely affect our existing domestic projects 
public utility holding company regulation under puhca  any corporation  partnership or other legal entity which owns or controls or more of the outstanding voting securities of a public utility company  or a company which is a holding company for a public utility company  is subject to registration with the securities and exchange commission sec and regulation under puhca  unless eligible for an exemption 
a holding company of a public utility company that is subject to registration is required by puhca to limit its utility operations to a single integrated utility system and to divest any other operations not functionally related to the operation of that utility system 
approval by the sec is required for nearly all important financial and business dealings of a registered holding company 
under purpa  most qfs are not public utility companies under puhca 
the energy policy act of  among other things  amends puhca to allow ewgs  under certain circumstances  to own and operate non qf electric generating facilities without subjecting those producers to registration or regulation under puhca 
the effect of such amendments has been to enhance the development of non qfs which do not have to meet the fuel  production and ownership requirements of purpa 
we believe that these amendments benefit us by expanding our ability to own and operate facilities that do not qualify for qf status 
however  they have also resulted in increased competition by allowing utilities and their affiliates to develop such facilities which are not subject to the constraints of puhca 
federal natural gas transportation regulation we have an ownership interest in gas fired cogeneration plants in operation or under construction 
the cost of natural gas is ordinarily the largest expense of a gas fired project and is critical to the projects economics 
the risks associated with using natural gas can include the need to arrange gathering  processing  extraction  blending  and storage  as well as transportation of the gas from great distances  including obtaining removal  export and import authority if the gas is transported from canada  the possibility of interruption of the gas supply or transportation depending on the quality of the gas reserves purchased or dedicated to the project  the financial and operating strength of the gas supplier  whether firm or non firm transportation is purchased and the operations of the gas pipeline  and obligations to take a minimum quantity of gas and pay for it ie  take and pay obligations 
pursuant to the natural gas act  ferc has jurisdiction over the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce 
with respect to most transactions that do not involve the construction of pipeline facilities  regulatory authorization can be obtained on a self implementing basis 
however  interstate pipeline rates and terms and conditions for such services are subject to continuing ferc oversight 
federal power act regulation under the fpa  ferc is authorized to regulate the transmission of electric energy and the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce 
unless otherwise exempt  any person that owns or operates facilities used for such purposes is considered a public utility subject to ferc jurisdiction 
ferc regulation under the fpa includes approval of the disposition of utility property  authorization of the issuance of securities by public utilities  regulation of the rates  terms and conditions for the transmission or sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce  the regulation of interlocking directorates  a uniform system of accounts and reporting requirements for public utilities 

table of contents ferc regulations implementing purpa provide that a qf is exempt from regulation under the foregoing provisions of the fpa 
an ewg is not exempt from the fpa and therefore an ewg that makes sales of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce is subject to ferc regulation as a public utility 
however  many of the regulations which customarily apply to traditional public utilities have been waived or relaxed for power marketers  ewgs and other non traditional public utilities that lack market power 
ewgs are regularly granted authorization to charge market based rates  blanket authority to issue securities  and waivers of certain ferc requirements pertaining to accounts  reports and interlocking directorates 
such action is intended to implement ferc s policy to foster a more competitive wholesale power market 
many of the generating projects in which we own an interest are operated as qfs and are therefore exempt from ferc regulation under the fpa 
however  several of our generating projects are or will be ewgs subject to ferc jurisdiction under the fpa 
several of our affiliates have been granted authority to engage in sales at market based rates and to issue securities  and have also been granted the customary waivers of ferc regulations available to non traditional public utilities  however  we cannot assure that such authorities or waivers will be granted in the future to other affiliates 
federal open access electric transmission regulation in the summer of ferc issued orders nos 
and ordering the functional unbundling of transmission and generation assets by the transmission owning utilities subject to its jurisdiction 
under order no 
 the jurisdictional transmission owning utilities  and many non jurisdictional transmission owners  were required to adopt the pro forma open access transmission tariff establishing terms of non discriminatory transmission service  including generator interconnection service 
order no 
required transmission owning utilities to publish information concerning the availability of transmission capacity and make such transmission capacity available on a non discriminatory basis 
in addition  these orders established the operational requirements of independent system operators iso  which are entities that have been given authority to operate the transmission assets of certain jurisdictional utilities 
the interpretation and application of the requirements of orders nos 
and continues to be refined through subsequent administrative proceedings at ferc 
these orders have been subject to review  and have been affirmed  by the courts 
in december ferc issued order no 
 which requires jurisdictional transmission owning utilities to enter into agreements with isos to operate their transmission systems or join a regional transmission organization rto  which would likewise control the transmission facilities in a certain region 
order no 
sets forth the basic governance terms for rtos 
to date  compliance by the transmission owning utilities has been uneven and has met with political resistance on the part of the state governments and the state public utilities commissions in some regions of the country 
the impact on our business of the implementation of order no 
and the development of rtos cannot be predicted 
in addition to its efforts in order nos 
  and and in creating rtos  ferc has attempted to further refine and clarify the rights and obligations of owners and users of the interstate transmission grid in its standard market design smd and interconnection rule making proceedings 
ferc s intention under the smd proceedings is to establish a set of standard rules  which could be adopted in the form of a revised tariff by transmission owning utilities  addressing the manner in which transmission capacity would be allocated  how generation would be dispatched given transmission constraints  the coordination of transmission upgrades and the allocation of costs associated therewith  among other transmission related issues 
the interconnection rule making proceeding is intended to establish uniform procedures for generator interconnection to the transmission grid  including the allocation of costs associated with transmission system upgrades and special facilities required to interconnect the generator to the grid 
both of the smd and interconnection rule making proceedings are pending currently 
the timing of ferc s issuance in either of these proceedings is uncertain and has been delayed due to political resistance on the part of the state governments and the state public utilities commissions in some regions in the country 
the impact on our business due to the issuance of final orders in these proceedings is uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time 

table of contents western energy markets there was significant price volatility in both wholesale electricity and gas markets in the western united states for much of calendar year and extending through the second quarter of due to a number factors  including drier than expected weather  which led to lower than normal hydro electric capacity in california and the northwestern united states  inadequate natural gas pipeline and electric generation capacity to meet higher than anticipated energy demand in the region  the inability of the california utilities to manage their exposure to such price volatility due to regulatory and financial constraints  and evolving market structures in california  prices for electricity and natural gas were much higher than anticipated 
a number of federal and state investigations and proceedings were commenced to address the crisis 
there are currently a number of proceedings pending at ferc which were initiated as a direct result of the price volatility in the energy markets in the western united states during this period 
many of these proceedings were initiated by buyers of wholesale electricity seeking refunds for purchases made during this period or the reduction of price terms in contracts entered into at this time 
we have been a party to some of these proceedings 
see item business risk factors california power market and item legal proceedings 
as part of certain proceedings  and as a result of its own investigations  ferc has ordered the implementation of certain measures for wholesale electricity markets in california and the western united states  including  the implementation of price caps on the day ahead or real time prices for electricity through september   and a continuing obligation of electricity generators to offer uncommitted generation capacity to the california independent system operator 
ferc is continuing to investigate the causes of the price volatility in the western united states during this period 
it is uncertain at this time when these proceedings and investigations at ferc will conclude or what will be the final resolution thereof 
see risk factors california power market below 
other federal and state governmental entities have and continue to conduct various investigations into the causes of the price volatility in the energy markets in the western united states during this time 
it is uncertain at this time when these investigations will conclude or what the results may be 
the impact on our business of the results of the investigations cannot be predicted at this time 
state regulation state public utility commissions pucs have historically had broad authority to regulate both the rates charged by  and the financial activities of  electric utilities operating in their states and to promulgate regulation for implementation of purpa 
since a power sales agreement becomes a part of a utility s cost structure generally reflected in its retail rates  power sales agreements with independent electricity producers  such as ewgs  are potentially under the regulatory purview of pucs and in particular the process by which the utility has entered into the power sales agreements 
if a puc has approved the process by which a utility secures its power supply  a puc is generally inclined to pass through the expense associated with a power purchase agreement with an independent power producer to the utility s retail customers 
however  a regulatory commission under certain circumstances may disallow the full reimbursement to a utility for the cost to purchase power from a qf or an ewg 
in addition  retail sales of electricity or thermal energy by an independent power producer may be subject to puc regulation depending on state law 
independent power producers which are not qfs under purpa  or ewgs pursuant to the energy policy act of  are considered to be public utilities in many states and are subject to broad regulation by a puc  ranging from requirement of certificate of public convenience and necessity to regulation of organizational  accounting  financial and other corporate matters 
states may assert jurisdiction over the siting and construction of electricity generating facilities including qfs and ewgs and  with the exception of qfs  over the issuance of securities and the sale or other transfer of assets by these facilities 
state pucs also have jurisdiction over the transportation of natural gas by local distribution companies ldcs 
each states regulatory laws are somewhat different  however  all generally require the ldc to obtain approval from the puc for the construction of facilities and transportation services if the ldcs generally applicable tariffs do not cover the proposed transaction 
ldc rates are usually subject to continuing

regulation of canadian gas the canadian natural gas industry is subject to extensive regulation by federal and provincial authorities 
at the federal level  a party exporting gas from canada must obtain an export license from the national energy board neb 
the neb also regulates canadian pipeline transportation rates and the construction of pipeline facilities 
gas producers also must obtain a removal permit or license from each provincial authority before natural gas may be removed from the province  and provincial authorities regulate intra provincial pipeline and gathering systems 
in addition  a party importing natural gas into the united states first must obtain an import authorization from the us department of energy 
environmental regulations the exploration for and development of geothermal resources  oil  gas liquids and natural gas  and the construction and operation of wells  fields  pipelines  various other mid stream facilities and equipment  and power projects  are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations adopted for the protection of the environment and to regulate land use 
the laws and regulations applicable to us primarily involve the discharge of emissions into the water and air and the use of water  but can also include wetlands preservation  endangered species  hazardous materials handling and disposal  waste disposal and noise regulations 
these laws and regulations in many cases require a lengthy and complex process of obtaining licenses  permits and approvals from federal  state and local agencies 
noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations can result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines or penalties 
in some instances  environmental laws also may impose clean up or other remedial obligations in the event of a release of pollutants or contaminants into the environment 
the following federal laws are among the more significant environmental laws as they apply to us 
in most cases  analogous state laws also exist that may impose similar  and in some cases more stringent  requirements on us as those discussed below 
clean air act the federal clean air act of the clean air act provides for the regulation  largely through state implementation of federal requirements  of emissions of air pollutants from certain facilities and operations 
as originally enacted  the clean air act sets guidelines for emissions standards for major pollutants ie  sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide from newly built sources 
in late  congress passed the clean air act amendments the amendments 
the amendments attempt to reduce emissions from existing sources  particularly previously exempted older power plants 
we believe that all of our operating plants and relevant oil and gas related facilities are in compliance with federal performance standards mandated under the clean air act and the amendments 
clean water act the federal clean water act the clean water act establishes rules regulating the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states 
we are required to obtain wastewater and storm water discharge permits for wastewater and runoff  respectively  from certain of our facilities 
we believe that  with respect to our geothermal and oil and gas operations  we are exempt from newly promulgated federal storm water requirements 
we are required to maintain a spill prevention control and countermeasure plan with respect to certain of our oil and gas facilities 
we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable discharge requirements of the clean water act 
oil pollution act of the oil pollution act of opa applies to our offshore facilities in the us gulf of mexico regulating oil pollution prevention measures and financial responsibility requirements 
we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable opa requirements

we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable uic requirements of the swda 
resource conservation and recovery act the resource conservation and recovery act rcra regulates the generation  treatment  storage  handling  transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste 
we believe that we are exempt from solid waste requirements under rcra 
however  particularly with respect to our solid waste disposal practices at the power generation facilities and steam fields located at the geysers  we are subject to certain solid waste requirements under applicable california laws 
based on the exploration and production exception  many oil and gas wastes are exempt from hazardous wastes regulation under rcra 
for those wastes generated in association with the exploration and production of oil and gas which are classified as hazardous wastes  we undertake to comply with the rcra requirements for identification and disposal 
various state environmental and safety laws also regulate the oil and gas industry 
we believe that our operations are in material compliance with rcra and all such laws 
comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla or superfund  requires cleanup of sites from which there has been a release or threatened release of hazardous substances and authorizes the united states environmental protection agency to take any necessary response action at superfund sites  including ordering potentially responsible parties prps liable for the release to take or pay for such actions 
prps are broadly defined under cercla to include past and present owners and operators of  as well as generators of wastes sent to  a site 
as of the present time  we are not subject to liability for any superfund matters 
however  we generate certain wastes  including hazardous wastes  and send certain of our wastes to third party waste disposal sites 
as a result  there can be no assurance that we will not incur liability under cercla in the future

table of contents risk factors capital resources we have substantial indebtedness that we may be unable to service and that restricts our activities 
we have substantial debt that we incurred to finance the acquisition and development of power generation facilities 
as of december   our total consolidated funded debt was billion  our total consolidated assets were billion and our stockholders equity was billion 
whether we will be able to meet our debt service obligations and repay  extend  or refinance our outstanding indebtedness will be dependent primarily upon the operational performance of our power generation facilities and of our oil and gas properties  movements in electric and natural gas prices over time  and our marketing and risk management activities 
this high level of indebtedness has important consequences  including limiting our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  execution of our growth strategy  or other purposes  limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service the debt  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures and adverse changes in government regulation  limiting our ability or increasing the costs to refinance indebtedness  and limiting our ability to enter into marketing  hedging  optimization and trading transactions by reducing the number of counterparties with whom we can transact as well as the volume of those transactions 
the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in certain of our existing debt agreements limit or prohibit our ability to incur indebtedness  make or purchase prepayments of indebtedness in whole or in part  pay dividends  make investments  lease properties  engage in transactions with affiliates  create liens  consolidate or merge with another entity  or allow one of our subsidiaries to do so  sell assets  and acquire facilities or other businesses 
also  if our ownership changes  the indentures governing certain of our senior notes may require us to make an offer to purchase those senior notes 
we cannot assure that we will have the financial resources necessary to purchase those senior notes in this event 
if we are unable to comply with the terms of our indentures and other debt agreements  or if we fail to generate sufficient cash flow from operations  or to refinance our debt as described below  we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our senior notes and other debt or to obtain additional financing 
however  we may be unable to refinance or obtain additional financing because of our high levels of debt and the debt incurrence restrictions under our indentures and other debt agreements 
if cash flow is insufficient and refinancing or additional financing is unavailable  we may be 
table of contents forced to default on our senior notes and other debt obligations 
in the event of a default under the terms of any of our indebtedness  the debt holders may accelerate the maturity of our obligations  which could cause defaults under our other obligations 
in addition  our senior notes  which are not secured  and our other senior unsecured debt are effectively subordinated to all of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness 
our secured indebtedness includes our billion secured term loan and revolving working capital credit facilities  which are secured by our interests in our us natural gas properties  the saltend power plant in the united kingdom  our equity investment in certain of our us power plants  and the notes evidencing certain intercompany debt  as well as pledges of of the equity in certain of calpine s direct us subsidiaries and of the equity in calpine canada energy ltd  which is the direct or indirect parent company of all of our canadian subsidiaries 
each borrowing under our total billion in secured revolving construction financing facilities is secured by the assets of the applicable project under construction 
we have additional secured non recourse project financings secured by the assets of the applicable project 
we must refinance our debt maturing in and in may  our million and million secured revolving credit facilities under our billion secured term and revolving working capital credit facilities will mature and the billion secured term credit facility will mature in may any letters of credit issued under the million secured revolving credit facility on or prior to may  can be extended for up to one year at our option so long as they expire no later than five business days prior to the maturity date of the term loan facility 
in november and  respectively  our billion and billion secured revolving construction financing facilities will mature  requiring us to refinance this indebtedness 
at december   we had million in funded borrowings outstanding under the secured term loan facility  and million in funded borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding under the secured revolving credit facilities 
under our billion and billion secured revolving construction financing facilities  we had million and  million outstanding  respectively 
in addition to the debt discussed above  million and million of miscellaneous debt and capital lease obligations are maturing in and  respectively 
our intent is to refinance all or a portion of such indebtedness  extend the maturity of the financing or obtain additional financing 
our ability to refinance this indebtedness will depend  in part  on events beyond our control  including the significant contraction in the availability of capital for participants in the energy sector  and actions taken by rating agencies 
if we are unable to refinance this indebtedness  we may be required to further delay our construction program  sell assets or obtain additional financing 
we may not be able to complete any such refinancing or asset sale  or obtain additional financing  on terms acceptable to us  or at the time needed or in the amounts required 
see item 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
we may be unable to secure additional financing in the future 
each power generation facility that we acquire or develop will require substantial capital investment 
our ability to arrange financing including any extension or refinancing and the cost of the financing are dependent upon numerous factors 
access to capital including any extension or refinancing for participants in the energy sector  including for us  has been significantly restricted since late other factors include general economic and capital market conditions  conditions in energy markets  regulatory developments  credit availability from banks or other lenders for us and our industry peers  as well as the economy in general  investor confidence in the industry and in us  the continued success of our current power generation facilities  and provisions of tax and securities laws that are conducive to raising capital 

table of contents we have financed our existing power generation facilities using a variety of leveraged financing structures  consisting of senior secured and unsecured indebtedness  construction financing  project financing  revolving credit facilities  term loans and lease obligations 
most of our construction costs during were financed through one of our two calpine construction finance company ccfc non recourse debt facilities see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had approximately billion of total consolidated funded debt  consisting of billion of secured term debt  billion of secured construction project financing  billion of capital lease obligations  billion in senior notes  billion in convertible senior notes  and billion of secured and unsecured notes payable and borrowings under lines of credit 
each project financing and lease obligation is structured to be fully paid out of cash flow provided by the facility or facilities financed or leased 
in the event of a default under a financing agreement which we do not cure  the lenders or lessors would generally have rights to the facility and any related assets 
in the event of foreclosure after a default  we might not retain any interest in the facility 
while we intend to utilize non recourse or lease financing when appropriate  market conditions and other factors may prevent similar financing for future facilities 
we do not believe the lack of availability of non recourse or lease financing will significantly affect our ability to continue to borrow funds in the future in order to finance new facilities 
however  it is possible that we may be unable to obtain the financing required to develop our power generation facilities on terms satisfactory to us 
we have from time to time guaranteed certain obligations of our subsidiaries and other affiliates 
our lenders or lessors may also seek to have us guarantee the indebtedness for future facilities 
guarantees render our general corporate funds vulnerable in the event of a default by the facility or related subsidiary 
additionally  certain of our indentures may restrict our ability to guarantee future debt  which could adversely affect our ability to fund new facilities 
our indentures do not limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur non recourse or lease financing for investment in new facilities 
our credit ratings have been downgraded and could be downgraded further 
on december   moody s downgraded our long term senior unsecured debt from baa its lowest investment grade rating to ba its highest non investment grade rating 
on april   moody s further downgraded our long term senior unsecured debt from ba to b we remain on credit watch with negative implications at moody s 
on december   fitch  inc fitch downgraded our long term senior unsecured debt from bbb its lowest investment grade rating to bb its highest non investment grade rating 
on march   fitch further downgraded our long term senior unsecured debt from bb to bb  and on december   fitch downgraded our long term senior unsecured debt from bb to b 
on march   standard poor s downgraded our corporate credit rating from bb its highest non investment grade rating to bb and assigned a rating of b to our long term senior unsecured debt 
on may   standard and poor s issued a rating of bbb its lowest investment grade level on our secured credit facilities 
we remain on credit watch with negative implications at standard and poor s 
many other issuers in the power generation sector have also been downgraded by one or more of the ratings agencies during this period 
such downgrades can have a negative impact on our liquidity by reducing attractive financing opportunities and increasing the amount of collateral required by trading counterparties 
we cannot assure you that moody s  fitch and standard poor s will not further downgrade our credit ratings in the future 
if our credit rating is downgraded  we could be required to  among other things  pay additional interest under our credit agreements  or provide additional guarantees  collateral  letters of credit or cash for credit support obligations  and it could increase our cost of capital  make our efforts to raise capital more difficult and have an adverse impact on us and our subsidiaries 
our ability to repay our debt depends upon the performance of our subsidiaries 
almost all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries and other affiliates 
as a result  we depend almost entirely upon their earnings and cash flow to service our indebtedness  including our ability to pay the interest on and principal of our senior notes 
the financing agreements of certain of our subsidiaries and other affiliates generally restrict their ability to pay dividends  make distributions  or otherwise transfer funds to us prior to the payment of other obligations  including operating expenses  lease payments and reserves 

table of contents our subsidiaries and other affiliates are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our senior notes or our billion secured term and revolving working capital credit facilities and do not guarantee the payment of interest on or principal of such debt 
the right of the holders of such debt to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries or other affiliates upon our liquidation or reorganization will be subordinated to the claims of any subsidiaries or other affiliates creditors including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by our subsidiaries or affiliates 
as of december   our subsidiaries had billion of secured construction project financing 
we may utilize project financing  when appropriate in the future  and this financing will be effectively senior to our senior notes and other senior unsecured debt 
the senior note indentures and our credit facilities impose limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness 
however  the indentures do not limit the amount of construction project financing that our subsidiaries may incur to finance the acquisition and development of new power generation facilities 
moreover  the senior secured credit facilities do impose certain limitations on such project financings 
operations revenue may be reduced significantly upon expiration or termination of our power sales agreements 
some of the electricity we generate from our existing portfolio is sold under long term power sales agreements that expire at various times 
we also sell power under short to intermediate to year contracts 
when the terms of each of these various power sales agreements expire  it is possible that the price paid to us for the generation of electricity may be reduced significantly 
use of derivatives can create volatility in earnings and may require significant cash collateral 
during  we recognized million in mark to market gains on electric power and natural gas derivatives 
please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation impact of recent accounting pronouncements for a detailed discussion of the accounting requirements under sfas no 
and eitf we may enter into other transactions in future periods that require us to mark various derivatives to market through earnings 
the nature of the transactions that we enter into in addition to volatility of natural gas and electric power prices will determine the volatility of earnings that we may experience 
as a result  in part  of the fallout from enron s declaration of bankruptcy on december   companies using derivatives have become more sensitive to the inherent risks of such transactions 
consequently  companies  including us  are requiring cash collateral for certain derivative transactions in excess of what was previously required 
as of december   we had million in margin deposits with counterparties  net of deposits posted by counterparties with us  and million of letters of credit to support ces risk management  compared to million and million  respectively  at december  movements in commodity prices as well as a reduction in our derivative activities have reduced our requirements to post collateral 
future cash collateral requirements may increase based on the extent of our involvement in derivative activities and movements in commodity prices and also based on our credit ratings 
we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of natural gas in the future 
to date  our fuel acquisition strategy has included various combinations of our own gas reserves  gas prepayment contracts  short  medium and long term supply contracts and gas hedging transactions 
in our gas supply arrangements  we attempt to match the fuel cost with the fuel component included in the facility s power sales agreements in order to minimize a project s exposure to fuel price risk 
in addition  the focus of our ces risk management organization is to manage the spark spread for our portfolio of generating plants  the spread between the cost of fuel and electricity revenues  and we actively enter into hedging transactions to lock in gas costs and spark spreads 
we believe that there will be adequate supplies of natural gas available at reasonable prices for each of our facilities when current gas supply agreements expire 
however  gas supplies may not be available for the full term of the facilities power sales agreements  and gas prices may increase significantly 
additionally  our credit rating may inhibit our ability to procure gas supply from third parties 
if gas is not available  or if gas 
table of contents prices increase above the level that can be recovered in electricity prices  there could be a negative impact on our results of operations 
our power project development and acquisition activities may not be successful 
the development of power generation facilities is subject to substantial risks 
in connection with the development of a power generation facility  we must generally obtain necessary power generation equipment  governmental permits and approvals  fuel supply and transportation agreements  sufficient equity capital and debt financing  electrical transmission agreements  and water supply and wastewater discharge agreements site agreements and construction contracts 
we may be unsuccessful in accomplishing any of these matters or in doing so on a timely basis 
in addition  project development is subject to various environmental  engineering and construction risks relating to cost overruns  delays and performance 
although we may attempt to minimize the financial risks in the development of a project by securing a favorable power sales agreement  obtaining all required governmental permits and approvals  and arranging adequate financing prior to the commencement of construction  the development of a power project may require us to expend significant sums for preliminary engineering  permitting and legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible  economically attractive or financeable 
if we were unable to complete the development of a facility  we might not be able to recover our investment in the project 
the process for obtaining initial environmental  siting and other governmental permits and approvals is complicated and lengthy  often taking more than one year  and is subject to significant uncertainties 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in the development of power generation facilities in the future 
we have grown substantially in recent years as a result of acquisitions of interests in power generation facilities and steam fields 
the integration and consolidation of our acquisitions with our existing business requires substantial management  financial and other resources and  ultimately  our acquisitions may not be successfully integrated 
in addition  as we transition from a development company to an operating company  we are not likely to continue to grow at historical rates due to acquisition activities in the near future 
although the domestic power industry is continuing to undergo consolidation and acquisition opportunities at favorable prices  we believe that we are likely to confront significant competition for those opportunities and  due to the constriction in the availability of capital resources for acquisitions and other expansion  to the extent that any opportunities are identified  we may be unable to complete the acquisitions 
conversely  to the extent we seek to divest assets  we may not be able to do so at attractive prices 
our projects under construction may not commence operation as scheduled 
the commencement of operation of a newly constructed power generation facility involves many risks  including start up problems  the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes  and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency 
new plants have no operating history and may employ recently developed and technologically complex equipment 
insurance is maintained to protect against certain risks  warranties are generally obtained for limited periods relating to the construction of each project and its equipment in varying degrees  and contractors and equipment suppliers are obligated to meet certain performance levels 
the insurance  warranties or performance guarantees  however  may not be adequate to cover lost revenues or increased expenses 
as a result  a project may be unable to fund principal and interest payments under its financing 
table of contents obligations and may operate at a loss 
a default under such a financing obligation  unless cured  could result in losing our interest in a power generation facility 
in certain situations  power sales agreements entered into with a utility early in the development phase of a project may enable the utility to terminate the agreement  or to retain security posted as liquidated damages  if a project fails to achieve commercial operation or certain operating levels by specified dates or fails to make specified payments 
in the event a termination right is exercised  the default provisions in a financing agreement may be triggered rendering such debt immediately due and payable 
as a result  the project may be rendered insolvent and we may lose our interest in the project 
in recent years we have relied less and less on traditional project financing  so the risk of a financing agreement default linked to a default under a power sales agreement comes into play infrequently 
our power generation facilities may not operate as planned 
upon completion of our projects currently under construction  we will operate of the power plants in which we will have an interest 
the continued operation of power generation facilities involves many risks  including the breakdown or failure of power generation equipment  transmission lines  pipelines or other equipment or processes  and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency 
although from time to time our power generation facilities have experienced equipment breakdowns or failures  these breakdowns or failures have not had a significant effect on the operation of the facilities or on our results of operations 
for calendar year  our gas fired and geothermal power generation facilities operated at an average availability of approximately and  respectively 
although our facilities contain various redundancies and back up mechanisms  a breakdown or failure may prevent the affected facility from performing under applicable power sales agreements 
in addition  although insurance is maintained to protect against operating risks  the proceeds of insurance may not be adequate to cover lost revenues or increased expenses 
as a result  we could be unable to service principal and interest payments under our financing obligations which could result in losing our interest in the power generation facility 
we cannot assure that our estimates of oil and gas reserves are accurate 
estimates of proved oil and gas reserves and the future net cash flows attributable to those reserves are prepared by independent petroleum and geological engineers 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and cash flows attributable to such reserves  including factors beyond our control and that of our engineers 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of an estimate of quantities of reserves  or of cash flows attributable to such reserves  is a function of the available data  assumptions regarding future oil and gas prices and expenditures for future development and exploitation activities  and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
additionally  reserves and future cash flows may be subject to material downward or upward revisions  based upon production history  development and exploration activities and prices of oil and gas 
actual future production  revenue  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses  underlying information  quantities of recoverable reserves and the value of cash flows from such reserves may vary significantly from the assumptions and underlying information set forth herein 
in addition  different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data 
our geothermal energy reserves may be inadequate for our operations 
the development and operation of geothermal energy resources are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties similar to those experienced in the development of oil and gas resources 
the successful exploitation of a geothermal energy resource ultimately depends upon the heat content of the extractable fluids  the geology of the reservoir  the total amount of recoverable reserves  operating expenses relating to the extraction of fluids  price levels relating to the extraction of fluids or power generated  and capital expenditure requirements relating primarily to the drilling of new wells 

table of contents in connection with each geothermal power plant  we estimate the productivity of the geothermal resource and the expected decline in productivity 
the productivity of a geothermal resource may decline more than anticipated  resulting in insufficient reserves being available for sustained generation of the electrical power capacity desired 
an incorrect estimate by us or an unexpected decline in productivity could  if material  adversely affect our results of operations 
geothermal reservoirs are highly complex 
as a result  there exist numerous uncertainties in determining the extent of the reservoirs and the quantity and productivity of the steam reserves 
reservoir engineering is an inexact process of estimating underground accumulations of steam or fluids that cannot be measured in any precise way  and depends significantly on the quantity and accuracy of available data 
as a result  the estimates of other reservoir specialists may differ materially from ours 
estimates of reserves are generally revised over time on the basis of the results of drilling  testing and production that occur after the original estimate was prepared 
we cannot assure that we will be able to successfully manage the development and operation of our geothermal reservoirs or that we will accurately estimate the quantity or productivity of our steam reserves 
market we depend on our electricity and thermal energy customers 
our systems of power generation facilities rely on one or more power sales agreements with one or more utilities or other customers for a substantial portion of our revenue 
in addition  sales of electricity to one customer during  the california department of water resources dwr  comprised approximately of our total revenue that year 
the loss of significant power sales agreements with dwr or an adverse change in dwr s ability to pay for power delivered under our contracts could have a negative effect on our results of operations 
in addition  any material failure by any customer to fulfill its obligations under a power sales agreement could have a negative effect on the cash flow available to us and on our results of operations 
competition could adversely affect our performance 
the power generation industry is characterized by intense competition  and we encounter competition from utilities  industrial companies and other independent power producers 
in recent years  there has been increasing competition in an effort to obtain power sales agreements  and this competition has contributed to a reduction in electricity prices in certain markets 
in addition  many states are implementing or considering regulatory initiatives designed to increase competition in the domestic power industry 
in california  the california public utilities commission cpuc issued decisions that provide for direct access for all customers as of april   however  the cpuc has recently suspended direct access in california effective september  as a result  uncertainty exists as to the future course for direct access in california in the aftermath of the energy crisis in that state 
in texas  legislation phases in a deregulated power market commencing january  regulatory initiatives are also being considered in other states  including new york and states in new england 
this competition has put pressure on electric utilities to lower their costs  including the cost of purchased electricity  and increasing competition in the supply of electricity in the future will increase this pressure 
our international investments may face uncertainties 
we have investments in oil and natural gas resources and power projects in canada in development and in operation  and an investment in a power generation facility in the uk  and we may pursue additional international investments in the future subject to the limitations on our expansion plans due to current capital market constraints 
international investments are subject to unique risks and uncertainties relating to the political  social and economic structures of the countries in which we invest 
risks specifically related to investments in non united states projects may include fluctuations in currency valuation  currency inconvertibility  expropriation and confiscatory taxation  
table of contents increased regulation  and approval requirements and governmental policies limiting returns to foreign investors 
california power market the unresolved issues arising out of the california power market could adversely affect our performance 
the volatility in the california power market from mid through mid has produced significant unanticipated results 
california long term supply contracts 
in  california adopted legislation permitting it to issue long term revenue bonds to fund wholesale purchases of power by the california department of water resources dwr 
the bonds will be repaid with the proceeds of payments by retail power customers over time 
ces and dwr entered into four long term supply contracts during in early  the california public utilities commission cpuc and the california electricity oversight board eob filed complaints under section of the federal power act with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc alleging that the prices and terms of the long term contracts with dwr were unjust and unreasonable and contrary to the public interest the complaint 
the contracts entered into by ces and dwr were subject to the complaint 
on april   we announced that we had renegotiated ces long term power contracts with dwr and settled the complaint 
the office of the governor  the cpuc  the eob and the attorney general for the state of california all endorsed the renegotiated contracts and dropped all pending claims against the company and its affiliates  including any efforts by the cpuc and the eob to seek refunds from the company and its affiliates through the ferc california refund proceedings 
in connection with the renegotiation  we agreed to pay million over three years to the ag to resolve any and all possible claims 
a summary of the material terms of the four dwr contracts  as renegotiated  follows contract provides for baseload power deliveries of megawatts for  megawatts for  and  megawatts for through at a fixed energy price of per megawatt hour 
in addition  calpine provides up to million and million megawatt hours of additional  flexible energy in and  respectively  with energy pricing indexed to gas and a two year fixed capacity payment 
contract provides for baseload power deliveries of megawatts for the first half of and  megawatts from july  through at a fixed energy price of per megawatt hour 
calpine provides up to million and million megawatt hours of additional  flexible energy in and  respectively  with energy pricing indexed to gas and a two year fixed capacity payment 
dwr has the right to complete four calpine projects planned for california if calpine does not meet certain milestones with respect to each project 
however  if dwr exercises this right  dwr must reimburse calpine for all construction costs and certain other costs incurred to date in connection with the project s being completed by dwr and this right has no effect on the prices  terms and conditions associated with the energy products being sold to dwr under contract contract provides dwr with a year option for  hours annually for megawatts of peak power in exchange for fixed annual capacity payments of million for years one through five and million per year thereafter 
if dwr exercises its option  the energy price paid is indexed to gas 
contract provides dwr up to megawatts of new peaking capacity for a year term  beginning with commercial operation of the los esteros energy center  for fixed annual average capacity payments and an energy price indexed to gas 
california electric power fund 
in november  the dwr completed the issuance of billion in revenue bonds 
part of the proceeds from this bond issuance was used to fund the electric power fund the fund  which will be used to meet dwr s payment obligations under its long term energy contracts 
revenue requirements for the repayment of the bonds will be determined at least annually and submitted to the cpuc 
under the terms of a rate agreement between the dwr and the cpuc  the cpuc is required to set rates for the customers of the state s investor owned utilities ious  such that the fund will always 
table of contents have monies to retire the bonds when due 
dwr is shifting certain power procurement responsibilities to the ious  other than those procurement obligations already committed under the terms of its long term contracts  such as the four long term contracts with ces discussed above 
ultimately  the financial responsibility for the long term contracts may be transferred to the ious  such as  pg e  however  this will not occur until a number of issues are addressed  including iou creditworthiness 
california refund proceeding 
on august  the california refund proceeding was initiated by a complaint made at ferc by san diego gas electric company and under section of the federal power act  alleging  among other things  that the markets operated by the california independent system operator caiso and the california power exchange px px were dysfunctional 
in addition to commencing an inquiry regarding the market structure  ferc established a refund effective period of october  to june  for sales made into those markets 
on june   ferc ordered price mitigation throughout the western united states in an attempt to reduce the dependence of the california market on spot markets in favor of longer term committed energy supplies 
subsequently  the chief administrative law judge chief alj issued his report and recommendations to ferc on july  on how refunds should be calculated 
based on the chief alj s report  ferc established a subsequent proceeding to determine the refund liability for each seller for a refund period of october  through june  during this refund period we sold much of our california merchant capacity in the bilateral markets  which sales are not subject to refund under this proceeding 
as a result of an order by the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit  ferc is required to consider the impact on possible market manipulation on potential refund liability 
in november  ferc issued an order establishing a special hundred day period for additional discovery 
in march the parties were required to submit reports addressing any such market manipulation 
this aspect of the proceeding has not yet been concluded 
on december   the administrative law judge issued a certification of proposed finding on california refund liability making an initial determination of refund liability the december certification 
under the december certification  calpine had potential direct and indirect refund liability of approximately million  considering the offsets available to us 
we have fully reserved the amount of refund liability that would potentially be owed under the december certification 
on march   ferc issued an order adopting many of the alj s findings set forth in the december certification the march order 
in addition  as a result of certain findings by the ferc staff concerning the unreliability or mis reporting of certain reported indices for gas prices in california during the refund period  ferc ordered that the basis for calculating a party s potential refund liability be modified by substituting a gas proxy price based upon gas prices in the producing areas plus the tariff transportation rate for the california gas price indices previously adopted in the refund proceeding 
at this time  we are unable to determine our potential liability under the march order 
however  based upon a preliminary understanding  we believe that such liability is likely to increase from that calculated in accordance with the december certification  but we are unable to estimate the amount of such potential increase at this time 
the final outcome of this proceeding and the impact on our business is uncertain at this time 
ferc investigation into western markets 
on february   ferc initiated an investigation of potential manipulation of electric and natural gas prices in the western united states 
this investigation was initiated as a result of allegations that enron and others  used their market position to distort electric and natural gas markets in the west 
the scope of the investigation is to consider whether  as a result of any manipulation in the short term markets for electric energy or natural gas or other undue influence on the wholesale markets by any party since january   the rates of the long term contracts subsequently entered into in the west are potentially unjust and unreasonable 
ferc has stated that it may use the information gathered in connection with the investigation to determine how to proceed on any existing or future complaint brought under section of the federal power act involving long term power contracts entered into in the west since january   or to initiate a federal power act section or natural gas act section proceeding on its own initiative 
on august   the ferc staff issued the initial report on company specific separate proceedings and generic reevaluations  published natural gas price data  and enron trading strategies the initial report summarizing its initial findings in this investigation 

table of contents there were no findings or allegations of wrongdoing by calpine set forth or described in the initial report 
on march   the ferc staff issued a final report in this investigation the final report 
the ferc staff recommended that ferc issue a show cause order to a number of companies  including calpine  regarding certain power scheduling practices that may potentially be in violation of the caiso s or calpx tariff 
we believe that it did not violate these tariffs and that  to the extent that such a finding could be made  any potential liability would not be material 
the final report also recommended that ferc modify the basis for determining potential liability in the california refund proceeding discussed above 
cpuc proceeding regarding qf contract pricing for past periods 
our qualifying facilities qf contracts with pacific gas and electric company pg e provide that the cpuc has the authority to determine the appropriate utility avoided cost to be used to set energy payments for certain qf contracts by determining the short run avoided cost srac energy price formula 
in mid  our qf facilities elected the option set forth in section of the california public utility code  which provides qfs the right to elect to receive energy payments based on the california power exchange px market clearing price instead of the price determined by srac 
having elected such option  we were paid based upon the px zonal day ahead clearing price px price from summer until january   when the px ceased operating a day ahead market 
the cpuc has conducted proceedings r 
to determine whether the px price was the appropriate price for the energy component upon which to base payments to qfs which had elected the px based pricing option 
the cpuc at one point issued a proposed decision to the effect that the px price was the appropriate price for energy payments under the california public utility code but tabled it  and a final decision has not been issued to date 
therefore  it is possible that the cpuc could order a payment adjustment based on a different energy price determination 
we believe that the px price was the appropriate price for energy payments but there can be no assurance that this will be the outcome of the cpuc proceedings 
government regulation we are subject to complex government regulation which could adversely affect our operations 
our activities are subject to complex and stringent energy  environmental and other governmental laws and regulations 
the construction and operation of power generation facilities and oil and gas exploration and production require numerous permits  approvals and certificates from appropriate federal  state and local governmental agencies  as well as compliance with environmental protection legislation and other regulations 
while we believe that we have obtained the requisite approvals for our existing operations and that our business is operated in accordance with applicable laws  we remain subject to a varied and complex body of laws and regulations that both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce 
existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted  or new laws and regulations may become applicable to us that may have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
we may be unable to obtain all necessary licenses  permits  approvals and certificates for proposed projects  and completed facilities may not comply with all applicable permit conditions  statutes or regulations 
in addition  regulatory compliance for the construction of new facilities is a costly and time consuming process 
intricate and changing environmental and other regulatory requirements may necessitate substantial expenditures to obtain permits 
if a project is unable to function as planned due to changing requirements or local opposition  it may create expensive delays or significant loss of value in a project 
our operations are potentially subject to the provisions of various energy laws and regulations  including purpa  the public utility holding company act of  as amended  puhca  and state and local regulations 
puhca provides for the extensive regulation of public utility holding companies and their subsidiaries 
purpa provides qfs as defined under purpa and owners of qfs exemptions from certain federal and state regulations  including rate and financial regulations 
under present federal law  we are not subject to regulation as a holding company under puhca  and will not be subject to such regulation as long as the plants in which we have an interest qualify as qfs  are subject to another exemption or waiver or qualify as an exempt wholesale generator ewg under the energy policy act of in order to be a qf  a facility must be not more than owned by one or more electric utility companies or electric utility holding companies 
in addition  a qf that is a cogeneration 
table of contents facility  such as the plants in which we currently have interests  must produce electricity as well as thermal energy for use in an industrial or commercial process in specified minimum proportions 
the qf also must meet certain minimum energy efficiency standards 
generally  any geothermal power facility which produces up to megawatts of electricity and meets purpa ownership requirements is considered a qf 
if any of the plants in which we have an interest lose their qf status or if amendments to purpa are enacted that substantially reduce the benefits currently afforded qfs  we could become a public utility holding company  which could subject us to significant federal  state and local regulation  including rate regulation 
if we become a holding company  which could be deemed to occur prospectively or retroactively to the date that any of our plants loses its qf status  all our other power plants could lose qf status because  under ferc regulations  a qf cannot be owned by an electric utility or electric utility holding company 
in addition  a loss of qf status could  depending on the particular power purchase agreement  allow the power purchaser to cease taking and paying for electricity or to seek refunds of past amounts paid and thus could cause the loss of some or all contract revenues or otherwise impair the value of a project 
if a power purchaser were to cease taking and paying for electricity or seek to obtain refunds of past amounts paid  there can be no assurance that the costs incurred in connection with the project could be recovered through sales to other purchasers 
such events could adversely affect our ability to service our indebtedness  including our senior notes 
see item business government regulation federal energy regulation federal power act regulation 
currently  congress is considering proposed legislation that would repeal puhca and amend purpa by limiting its mandatory purchase obligation to existing contracts 
in light of the circumstances in california  the pacific gas and electric company bankruptcy and the enron corp 
bankruptcy  among other events in recent years  there are a number of federal legislative and regulatory initiatives that could result in changes in how the energy markets are regulated 
we do not know whether this legislation or regulatory initiatives will be adopted or  if adopted  what form they may take 
we cannot provide assurance that any legislation or regulation ultimately adopted would not adversely affect our existing domestic projects 
in addition  many states are implementing or considering regulatory initiatives designed to increase competition in the domestic power generation industry and increase access to electric utilities transmission and distribution systems for independent power producers and electricity consumers 
however  in light of the circumstances in the california power markets and the bankruptcies of both pg e and enron  the pace and direction of further deregulation at the state level in many jurisdictions is uncertain 
see item business recent developments california power market 
other risk factors we depend on our management and employees 
our success is largely dependent on the skills  experience and efforts of our people 
while we believe that we have excellent depth throughout all levels of management and in all key skill levels of our employees  the loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management or numerous employees with critical skills  could have a negative effect on our business  financial results and future growth 
seismic disturbances could damage our projects 
areas where we operate and are developing many of our geothermal and gas fired projects are subject to frequent low level seismic disturbances 
more significant seismic disturbances are possible 
our existing power generation facilities are built to withstand relatively significant levels of seismic disturbances  and we believe we maintain adequate insurance protection 
however  earthquake  property damage or business interruption insurance may be inadequate to cover all potential losses sustained in the event of serious seismic disturbances 
additionally  insurance may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 

table of contents our results are subject to quarterly and seasonal fluctuations 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so in the future as a result of a number of factors  including seasonal variations in energy prices  variations in levels of production  the timing and size of acquisitions  and the completion of development projects 
additionally  because we receive the majority of capacity payments under some of our power sales agreements during the months of may through october  our revenues and results of operations are  to some extent  seasonal 
the price of our common stock is volatile 
the market price for our common stock has been volatile in the past  and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future 
these factors include general conditions in our industry  the power markets in which we participate  or the worldwide economy  announcements of developments related to our business or sector  fluctuations in our results of operations  our debt to equity ratios and other leverage ratios  effect of significant events relating to the energy sector in general  sales of substantial amounts of our securities into the marketplace  an outbreak of war or hostilities  a shortfall in revenues or earnings compared to securities analysts expectations  changes in analysts recommendations or projections  and announcements of new acquisitions or development projects by us 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future  and these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance 
general market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock  and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices

we hold additional leases for other satellite offices 
we either lease or own the land upon which our power generating facilities are built 
we believe that our properties are adequate for our current operations 
a description of our power generating facilities is included under item business 
we have leasehold interests in leases comprising  acres of federal  state and private geothermal resource lands in the geysers area in northern california 
in the glass mountain and medicine lake areas in northern california  we hold leasehold interests in leases comprising approximately  acres of federal geothermal resource lands 
in general  under these leases  we have the exclusive right to drill for  produce and sell geothermal resources from these properties and the right to use the surface for all related purposes 
each lease requires the payment of annual rent until commercial quantities of geothermal resources are established 
after such time  the leases require the payment of minimum advance royalties or other payments until production commences  at which time production royalties are payable 
such royalties and other payments are payable to landowners  state and federal agencies and others  and vary widely as to the particular lease 
the leases are generally for initial terms varying from to years or for so long as geothermal resources are produced and sold 
certain of the leases contain drilling or other exploratory work requirements 
in certain cases  if a requirement is not fulfilled  the lease may be terminated and in other cases additional payments may be required

the primary reasons for the significant levels of these sales and costs of revenue items include a the growth of calpine energy services ces in and compared to and the corresponding increase in hedging  balancing and optimization activities  b particularly volatile markets for electricity and natural gas  which prompted us to frequently adjust our hedge positions by buying power and gas and reselling it  c the accounting requirements under staff accounting bulletin sab no

 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an asset  which require us to show most of our hedging contracts on a gross basis as opposed to netting sales and cost of revenue  and d rules in effect throughout and associated with the nepool market in new england  which require that all power generated in nepool be sold directly to the independent system operator iso in that market  we then buy from the iso to serve our customer contracts 
generally accepted accounting principles require us to account for this activity  which applies to three of our merchant generating facilities  as the aggregate of two distinct sales and one purchase

results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  in millions  except for unit pricing information and mw volumes change change restated total revenue the increase in total revenue is explained by category below 
change change restated electricity and steam revenue sales of purchased power for hedging and optimization total electric generation and marketing revenue electricity and steam revenue increased as we completed construction and brought into operation new baseload power plants  new peaker facilities and project expansions in average megawatts in operation of our consolidated plants increased by to  mw while generation increased by 
the increase in generation lagged behind the increase in average mw in operation as our baseload capacity factor dropped to in from in primarily because we operated fewer hours  especially in off peak periods  than in  due to the increased occurrence of unattractive market spark spreads in certain areas 
the overall increase in generation was partially offset by lower average pricing  which dropped as average realized electric prices  before the effects of hedging  balancing and optimization  declined to mwh in from mwh in sales of purchased power for hedging and optimization decreased during  due to lower power prices and industry wide credit restrictions on risk management activities in change change restated oil and gas sales sales of purchased gas for hedging and optimization total oil and gas production and marketing revenue oil and gas sales are net of internal consumption  which increased by to in internal consumption is eliminated in consolidation 
additionally oil and gas sales were reduced by reclassification of in and in to discontinued operations for assets sold 
before inter company eliminations and reclassifications to discontinued operations  oil and gas sales decreased by due primarily to lower average realized natural gas pricing in 
table of contents sales of purchased gas for hedging and optimization increased during as we brought into operation new generation and the related level of physical gas optimization and balancing activity increased to support the new generation 
change change restated realized revenue on power and gas trading  net unrealized mark to market gain loss on trading  net total trading revenue  net realized revenue on power and gas trading activity represents the portion of trading contracts actually settled 
in the year ended december   we recognized a net unrealized mark to market gain of from power contracts in a market area where we did not have generation assets and approximately of gains from various other power and gas transactions 
the shift from unrealized mark to market revenue in to unrealized loss in reflects industry wide credit and liquidity restrictions on risk management and trading activities  which caused us to greatly curtail trading activities so that our available capacity could be concentrated on hedging activities associated with our existing physical power and gas assets 
also  in we established liquidity reserves of approximately against unrealized mark to market revenue to take into account reduced liquidity and the resulting increase in bid ask spreads in the energy industry 
change change restated other revenue the decrease in is due primarily to one time license fee revenue of recognized in by our wholly owned subsidiary power systems mfg  llc psm 
in addition  we recognized less in revenue from wrms engineering  inc wrms  our california based engineering and architectural subsidiary  as wrms began to increase its work related to calpine projects for which revenue is eliminated in consolidation 
change change restated cost of revenue the increase in total cost of revenue is explained by category below 
change change restated plant operating expense royalty expense purchased power expense for hedging and optimization total electrical generation and marketing expense plant operating expense increased due to new baseload power plants  new peaker facilities and expansion projects completed during  but  expressed per mwh of generation  it decreased from mwh to mwh as economies of scale are being realized due to the increase in the average size of our plants 
royalty expense decreased due to a decrease in revenue at the geysers geothermal plants due to lower electric prices 

table of contents the decrease in purchased power expense was caused by lower power prices and by industry wide credit restrictions on risk management activities in change change restated oil and gas production expense purchased gas expense for hedging and optimization total oil and gas production and marketing expense purchased gas expense for hedging and optimization increased during as we brought into operation new generation and the related level of physical gas optimization and balancing activity increased to support the new generation 
oil and gas production expense increased primarily due to increases in gas treating and transportation costs coupled with higher lifting costs due to a increase in equivalent volumes and due to inflation 
change change restated fuel expense fuel expense increased in due to an increase in gas fired megawatt hours generated which was partially offset by significantly lower gas prices  increased usage of internally produced gas and an improved average heat rate of our generation portfolio in change change restated depreciation  depletion and amortization expense depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased primarily due to additional power facilities in consolidated operations during as compared to change change restated operating lease expense operating lease expense increased due to the rockgen  aidlin and south point sale leaseback transactions entered into during change change restated other expense the decrease is primarily due to less expense at psm  as combustion parts sales to third parties decreased in change change restated income from unconsolidated investments in power projects the modest increase is primarily due to approximately earned from our investment in the acadia facility  which commenced operations in august  partially offset by less revenue from our investment in lockport  which we sold in the first quarter of  losses at androscoggin and greys ferry in due to lower spark spreads  and a decrease in interest income from loans to power projects resulting from the extinguishment of a note from the delta energy center  llc after we acquired the remaining interest in november change change restated equipment cancellation and asset impairment charge 
table of contents the pre tax charge of in the year ended december   was a result of turbine and other equipment order cancellation charges and related write offs as a result of our revised construction and development program 
for further information  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
change change restated project development expense project development expense increased primarily because we expensed of previously capitalized costs due to the cancellation or indefinite suspension of certain development projects 
additionally we stopped capitalizing costs on certain development projects placed on hold 
change change restated general and administrative expense the increase was attributable to continued growth in personnel and associated overhead costs necessary to support the overall growth in our operations 
in addition we incurred of severance costs and the write off of excess office space due to the reduction of our work force during general and administrative expense expressed per mwh of generation decreased to mwh in from mwh in change change restated merger expense the merger expense of in the year ended december   was a result of the pooling of interests transaction with encal energy ltd 
that closed on april  change change restated interest expense interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of the convertible senior notes due and additional senior notes issued in the second half of and due to the new plants entering commercial operations at which point capitalization of interest expense ceases 
interest capitalized increased from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december   due to a larger construction portfolio during most of we expect that interest expense will continue to increase and the amount of interest capitalized will decrease in future periods as our plants in construction are completed  and  to a lesser extent  as a result of suspension of certain of our development projects and suspension of capitalization of interest thereon 
change change restated interest income the decrease in interest income is due primarily to lower cash balances and lower interest rates in change change restated other income expense in the primary contributions to other income were the recognition of of gain from the receipt of senior notes  which were trading at a discount to fair value  as consideration for british columbia asset sales and a gain on the termination of a power sales agreement 
in  other income resulted from contract settlements  gains from the extinguishment of debt  and gains from the sales of certain assets 
change change restated provision benefit for income taxes 
table of contents the decrease is primarily due to the significant decrease in income from continuing operations from to in  the income tax benefit was caused by a full year of permanent tax items arising out of our cross border financings in see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussions 
change change restated discontinued operations  net of tax the increase in results reflects approximately of gains relating to the sale of the assets  partially offset by lower earnings from these discontinued operations as they did not contribute to earnings for the full year in and due to higher gas prices in see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
change change restated cumulative effect of a change in acct 
principle  net of tax in  the of additional income net of tax of  is due to the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
change change restated net income the decrease in net income reflects a decrease in gross profit resulting primarily from lower spark spreads per mwh  which more than offset the positive effects of the increase in generation volume 
it also reflects lower trading revenue in additionally  we recorded in turbine cancellation and impairment charges in  and interest expense increased by as more plants entered commercial operations and interest ceased being capitalized on them at that time 
finally  we experienced higher general and administrative expense in due to the dramatic growth in our operations 
these factors were mitigated by a reduction in income tax expense and a gain from receipt of senior notes in consideration for an asset sale discussed above 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  in millions  except for unit pricing information and mw volumes change change restated restated total revenue the increase in total revenue is explained by category below

in addition  the results include the consolidated results of additional facilities that we acquired during and the full year of production from facilities that we acquired at various times during average megawatts in operation of our consolidated plants increased by to  mw while generation increased by 
the overall increase in generation 
table of contents was partially offset by lower average pricing  which dropped as average realized electric prices  before the effects of hedging  balancing and optimization  declined to mwh in from mwh in among the long term power contracts we entered into in california in  one had a year term  and one had a five year term 
each contract was negotiated in early  commenced on july   and provided for pricing at megawatt hour during the first six months which included the peak summer season of when natural gas costs were very high and blackouts were feared 
the contracts then provided for a flat fixed price of and  respectively  per megawatt hour for the balance of the contract terms  when gas prices were expected to return to more normal levels 
we concluded that each contract contained two separate elements the six month period in  and the period commencing january   and consequently we accounted for each element separately 
had we concluded that each contract contained only one element  we would have calculated an average price for the contract as a whole and recognized revenue on a straight line basis 
the impact of the latter approach would have been approximately less revenue less after tax net income in  and more revenue more after tax net income in the aggregate over the balance of the contracts 
market circumstances were unique at the time these two contracts were executed  and accordingly  we do not anticipate that we will enter into contracts with similar characteristics in the future in which elements would be separated in the same manner 
sales of purchased power for hedging and optimization increased during  due to increased hedging  balancing and optimization activity as a result of the growth of calpine energy services ces and our operating plant portfolio during and also reflects the significant volatility in commodity pricing which led to a high volume of hedging and hedge adjusting activity 
change change restated restated oil and gas sales sales of purchased gas for hedging and optimization total oil and gas production and marketing revenue the increase in oil and gas sales relates to increased production and commodity prices in sales to third parties from our reserves in canada and in the united states 
sales of purchased gas increased during  due to increased hedging  balancing and optimization activity as a result of the growth of ces and our operating plant portfolio during and also reflects the significant volatility in commodity pricing which led to a high volume of hedging and hedge adjusting activity 
change change restated restated realized revenue on power and gas trading  net unrealized mark to market gain loss on trading  net total trading revenue  net realized revenue on power and gas trading activity represents the portion of trading contracts actually settled 
we recognized net of a reserve of in mark to market gains on power derivatives in the reserve is related to gains generated by enron s insolvency which required earnings recognition for contracts that had previously been exempted from sfas no 
accounting as normal purchases or sales  and which represented the change in fair value of cash flow hedges between the ineffectiveness date and the date of termination 
the reserve equals of the net mark to market gain that would have otherwise been recognized 
the reserve was established due to the uncertainty surrounding the termination and settlement of the enron contracts and will be reevaluated as we complete the enron settlement process 
approximately of the of the mark to market gain was recognized in the second quarter of from entering into a fixed price firm quantity power sales contract for with one counterparty in a market area where we did not have generating assets for at least the first six months of the contract 
the 
table of contents contract presented us with an opportunity to establish a commercial relationship with an important customer in a market where we would eventually have generation assets  and we determined there was substantial benefit in executing the agreement for the entire term requested by the counterparty  as opportunities to enter into such a contract may be available infrequently 
because of the structure of the contract  under sfas no 
the contract and the related commodity derivative transactions did not constitute a hedge or a normal purchase or sale 
before taking into account time value of money considerations  the aggregate gain was at september   this gain was locked in as a result of entering into offsetting fixed price power purchases 
however  on december   we terminated the portion of those offsetting purchases where enron was the counterparty  which constituted approximately of the power purchases 
we have subsequently completed the process of replacing these contracts 
at march   we had replaced of the terminated volume 
our future expansion plans may result in our entry into new markets  which could present similar opportunities  and any resulting power and gas contracts would require similar accounting treatment 
change change restated restated other revenue in other revenue primarily included from psm  which was acquired in december  in revenues from our wrms subsidiary and in commissioning services we provided to an unconsolidated construction project 
change change restated restated cost of revenue the increase in total cost of revenue is explained by category below 
change change restated restated plant operating expense royalty expense purchased power expense for hedging and optimization total electric generation and marketing expense plant operating expense increased by due to additional projects in operation and a growth in generation  but  expressed per mwh of generation  plant operating expenses decreased from mwh to mwh as economies of scale were being realized due to the increase in the average size of our plants 
royalty expense decreased between periods due to a decrease in revenue at the geysers geothermal plants due to lower average electric prices 
purchased power expense for hedging and optimization increased in tandem with sales of purchased power for hedging and optimization due to our greatly increased price hedging  balancing and optimization activities described above 
change change restated restated oil and gas production expense purchased gas expense for hedging and optimization total oil and gas production and marketing expense oil and gas production expense increased due to an increase in related oil and gas sales and due to increased commodity prices 

table of contents purchased gas expense for hedging and optimization increased due to our greatly increased price hedging  balancing and optimization activities associated with our power generation plants 
change change restated restated fuel expense fuel expense increased primarily due to a increase in megawatt hours generated 
change change restated restated depreciation  depletion and amortization expense depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased due primarily to additional power facilities in consolidated operations during as compared to  as well as a increase in our oil and gas operating assets 
change change restated restated operating lease expense operating lease expense increased due to a full year of operating lease expense in connection with operating leases entered into or acquired for our tiverton  rumford  kiac  west ford flat and bear canyon facilities during  and additional operating lease expense for the sale leaseback transactions of our rockgen  aidlin and south point facilities entered into in change change restated restated other expense other expense increased primarily due to more expense at psm  which was acquired in december  change change restated restated income from unconsolidated investments in power projects the decrease is primarily due to contractual reduction in distributions from the sumas power plant of approximately we also experienced a decrease in income from our grays ferry investment and less in income due to the sale of our bayonne investment in march this was partially offset by a increase in interest income from loans to power projects related to a note from the delta energy center  llc 
in addition  in we had a loss from our investment in the kennedy international airport power plant which was consolidated in following our acquisition of the remaining interest 
change change restated restated project development expense project development expense increased due to an increase in the number of projects in the early stage of development 
change change restated restated general and administrative expense the increase was attributable to continued growth in personnel and associated overhead costs necessary to support the overall growth in our operations and due to recent acquisitions  including power facilities and natural gas operations 
the growth induced increase was offset by a decrease in cash bonus accruals to reflect 
table of contents a higher mix of stock options in our incentive program for management 
general and administrative expense expressed per mwh of generation decreased to mwh in from mwh in change change restated restated merger expense the merger expense of in the year ended december   was a result of the pooling of interests transaction with encal energy ltd 
that closed on april  change change restated restated interest expense interest expense increased primarily due to a full year of interest expense in for billion of senior notes issued in  in addition to interest expense on approximately billion  c million  and million of senior notes issued in the associated incremental interest expense was partially offset by interest capitalized 
in total capitalized interest was versus in capitalized interest increased between years due to the significant increase in our power plant construction program  which offset the slight decrease in our interest capitalization rate due to a decrease in market interest rates 
change change restated restated distributions on trust preferred securities the increase is attributable to the issuance of additional trust preferred securities in august  as well as a full period of distributions in with respect to the january trust preferred offering and the subsequent exercise of the initial purchasers option to purchase additional securities 
change change restated restated interest income this increase is due primarily to the significantly higher cash balances that we maintained as a result of our senior notes and convertible securities offerings in  in addition to interest income in realized in connection with of pg e of pre bankruptcy petition receivables 
change change restated restated other income expense  net other income in is primarily comprised of approximately related to the settlement and termination of a contract with a gas supplier and related to gains on the sale of oil and gas properties 
in addition  represents the gain on extinguishment of debt  primarily a gain of from repurchasing aggregate principal amount of our zero coupon convertible debentures zero coupons at a discount  partially offset by the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs of we also recorded a loss of for the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs resulting from the repayment of in aggregate outstanding principal amount of the senior notes due and bridge credit facilities entered into in june in  we also recorded gains of on the sale of our interests in the elwood development project and on the sale of our interest in the bayonne power plant including related contingent income recognized as earned thereafter 
these increases were partially offset by a reserve resulting from the nonperformance by a third party in delivering certain emissions reduction credits that we had purchased  and by the sale of the balance of our pg e pre bankruptcy petition receivables at a discount 
change change restated restated provision benefit for income taxes

principle  net of tax in  the of additional income net of tax of is due to the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
change change restated restated net income the increase in net income reflects a increase in gross profit which primarily reflects a increase in generation  which was partially offset by a decrease in average spark spread per mwh  and also reflects of trading revenue in versus none in the increase in gross profit was partially offset by higher general and administrative expense  of merger expense associated with the encal acquisition  higher interest expense and higher income tax expense in these higher expense items were mitigated by higher other income and higher interest income in see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements regarding the restatement of financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources general beginning in the latter half of  and continuing through to date  there has been a significant contraction in the availability of capital for participants in the energy sector 
this was due to a range of factors  including uncertainty arising from the collapse of enron corp 
and a perceived near term surplus supply of electric generating capacity 
these factors continued in  during which contracting credit markets and decreased spark spreads adversely impacted our liquidity and earnings 
while we were able to access the capital and bank credit markets in the first half of  as discussed below  it was on significantly different terms than in the past 
we recognize that terms of financing available to us in the future may not be attractive 
to protect against this possibility and due to current market conditions  we scaled back our capital expenditure program for and to enable us to conserve our available capital resources 
to date  we have obtained cash from our operations  borrowings under our term loan and revolving credit facilities  issuance of debt  equity  trust preferred securities and convertible debentures  proceeds from sale leaseback transactions  sale of certain assets and project financing 
we have utilized this cash to fund our operations  service or prepay debt obligations  fund acquisitions  develop and construct power generation facilities  finance capital expenditures  support our hedging  balancing  optimization and trading activities at ces  and meet our other cash and liquidity needs 
our business is capital intensive 
our ability to capitalize on growth opportunities is dependent on the availability of capital on attractive terms  the availability of such capital in today s environment is uncertain 
our strategy is also to reinvest our cash from operations into our business development and construction program or use it to reduce debt  rather than to pay cash dividends 
factors that could affect our liquidity and capital resources are also discussed in item business risk factors 

table of contents cash flow activities the following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the periods indicated years ended december  restated restated in thousands beginning cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents ending cash and cash equivalents see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements regarding the restatement of financial statements 
operating activities for provided net cash of  million  a increase from  consisting primarily of a million decrease in operating assets due primarily to the sale of our remaining pre bankruptcy petition accounts receivable from pg e in january for approximately million see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  a million increase in operating liabilities  million of depreciation  depletion and amortization  million of equipment cancellation and asset impairment charge  and million of development cost write offs 
this was partially offset by a million decrease in net derivative liabilities and other comprehensive income related to derivatives  and million of gains on assets sales and retirement of debt 
investing activities for consumed net cash of billion  primarily due to billion for construction costs and capital expenditures including gas turbine generator costs and associated capitalized interest  million of advances to joint ventures including associated capitalized interest for investments in power projects under construction  and million of capitalized project development costs including associated capitalized interest 
this was partially offset by million in proceeds from asset sales  and million from derivatives not designated as hedges 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities in is primarily due to scale back of our construction and acquisition program 
financing activities for provided billion of net cash consisting of from borrowings under notes payable and lines of credit  million of proceeds from our issuance of convertible senior notes due  million in additional project financing  million from the issuance of common stock  and million from our canadian income trust offering 
this was offset by billion of repayments on various credit facilities  and million of financing costs 
the decrease in cash provided from financing activities in is primarily due to the suspension of certain capital requiring activities and industry wide credit restrictions 
we have made certain reclassifications in our financial statements  including certain presentation changes in our restated consolidated statements of cash flows for and  to reflect the restatements discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements as well as other reclassifications to conform to the current year presentation 
in the restated statement we reduced deferred income taxes  net in cash flows from operating activities by million and increased acquisitions  net of cash acquired in cash flows from investing activities by million 
this was the amount of gross up of deferred taxes on contingent purchase price premium paid in in connection with the skygen acquisition 

table of contents we continue to evaluate current and forecasted cash flow as a basis for funding operating requirements and capital expenditures 
in november and our billion and billion secured revolving construction financing facilities will mature  requiring us to refinance this indebtedness 
at december   there was million and  million outstanding  respectively  under these facilities 
in may  our billion secured working capital revolving credit facilities will mature and the billion secured term credit facility will mature in may at december   we had million in funded borrowings under the revolving credit facilities and million in funded borrowings outstanding under the term loan facility 
these facilities will also have to be refinanced 
we believe that  if we are able to refinance these facilities  we will have sufficient liquidity from cash flow from operations  borrowings available under lines of credit  access to sale leaseback and project financing markets  sale of certain assets and cash balances to satisfy all obligations under our other outstanding indebtedness  and to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the next twelve months 
customers as of december   we had collection exposures after established reserves from certain of our counterparties as follows million from the california independent system operator corporation and automated power exchange  inc  approximately million and million  with two subsidiaries of sierra pacific resources company  nevada power company and sierra pacific power  respectively  million with nrg power marketing  inc and million with aquila merchant services  inc and aquila 
while we cannot predict the likelihood of default by our customers  we are continuing to closely monitor our positions and will adjust the values of the reserves as conditions dictate 
based on our legal analysis  we do not have any net collection exposure to enron and its affiliates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
letter of credit facilities at december  and  we had approximately million and million respectively  in letters of credit outstanding under various credit facilities to support ces risk management  and other operational and construction activities 
of the total letters of credit outstanding  million and million  respectively  were issued under the corporate revolving credit facilities at december  and ces margin deposits and other credit support as of december  and  ces had deposited net amounts of million and million  respectively  in cash as margin deposits with third parties related to its business activities and had letters of credit outstanding to support ces risk management activities of million and million  respectively 
the amount of credit support required to support ces s operations is a function primarily of the changes in fair value of commodity contracts that ces has entered into and our credit rating 
since december   the amount of credit support provided by us for ces transactions has declined  largely due to the reduction of ces s activities as well as changes in commodity prices in late as compared with late while we believe that we have adequate liquidity to support ces operations at this time  it is difficult to predict future developments and the amount of credit support that we may need to provide as part of our business operations 
working capital at december  we had a negative working capital balance current assets minus current liabilities of  million 
this was primarily caused by  million of debt  including balances outstanding under our billion construction revolving credit facility and our million working capital revolving credit facility that we intend to refinance or extend 
until such time as the debt is refinanced or extended  we are classifying it as current 
revised capital expenditure program following a comprehensive review of our power plant development program  we announced in january the adoption of a revised capital expenditure program  which contemplated the completion of power projects representing  mw then under construction 
seventeen of these facilities have subsequently achieved full or partial commercial operation as of december  construction of advanced stage development projects is expected to proceed only when there is an established market need for additional generating resources at prices that will allow us to meet our investment criteria  and when capital may again become available to us on attractive terms 
further  our entire 
table of contents development and construction program is flexible and subject to continuing review and revision based upon such criteria 
on march   we announced a new turbine program that reduced previously forecasted capital spending by approximately billion in and billion in the revision includes adjusted timing of turbine delivery and related payment schedules and also cancellation of some orders 
as a result of these turbine cancellations and other equipment cancellations  we recorded a pre tax charge of million in the first quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we entered into restructured agreements with our major gas and steam turbine manufacturers  generally extending the time frame for us to decide whether to proceed with or cancel our existing orders for gas turbines and steam turbines 
the new agreements reduce our future capital commitments by approximately billion and provide greater flexibility to match equipment commitments with our revised construction and development program 
in recognition of probable market and capital limitations  we recorded a pre tax charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of  which represented all costs associated with the potential cancellation of all of these gas turbines and steam turbines 
uses and sources of funding our estimated uses of funds for are as follows construction costs of billion  maintenance capital of billion  cash lease payments of billion and billion for future turbine capital 
these outflows will be funded primarily through cash on hand cash and cash equivalents and current portion of restricted cash of billion and an estimated billion of operating cash flow 
the other projected sources of funding will include billion from contract securitization  billion from asset sales  billion from construction project financing  billion from lease or other project financing and billion from a secondary offering of part of our interests in the canadian power income fund 
actual costs for the projected use of funds identified above  and net proceeds from the projected sources of funds identified above could vary from those estimates  potentially in material respects 
in addition  the timing is difficult to predict and we may not be able to complete the financings or they may be able to complete them only on less favorable terms than currently anticipated 
the above assumes the refinancing of the corporate revolving line of credit and the refinancing or extension of the revolving construction financing facility  which are both expiring in factors that could affect the accuracy of these estimates include the factors identified at the beginning of this section and under risk factors in item business 
capital availability access to capital for many in the energy sector  including us  has been restricted since late while we were able in the first half of to access the capital and bank credit markets  in this new environment  it was on significantly different terms than in the past  in particular our senior working capital facility has been secured by certain of our assets and equity interests 
the terms of financing available to us now and in the future may not be attractive to us and the timing of the availability of capital is uncertain and is dependent  in part  on market conditions that are difficult to predict and are outside of our control 
we were able to raise the following capital in up to million of vendor financing with siemens westinghouse power corporation in january proceeds of million after underwriting fees from a public offering of common stock of million shares at per share completed in april  proceeds were used to repay debt and for general corporate purposes million net funding for california peaker facilities million drawn in may and million repaid in august in march  we secured our previously unsecured working capital credit facility and increased it to billion 
subsequently we increased our two year secured bank term loan from million to 
table of contents billion subsequently permanently reduced to million and simultaneously reduced our secured corporate revolving credit facilities to billion  inclusive of letter of credit usage million non recourse project financing for construction of blue spruce energy center completed in august canadian power income fund in august and september and february for a total of us million cdn million including our secondary offering of warranted units in february secured project financings of million and million  respectively  for the newark and parlin power plants completed in december asset sales as a result of the significant contraction in the availability of capital for participants in the energy sector  we have adopted a strategy of conserving our core strategic assets and disposing of certain less strategically important assets  which serves primarily to strengthen our balance sheet through repayment of debt 
set forth below are the completed asset disposals on august   we completed the sale of certain oil and gas properties medicine river properties located in central alberta to nal oil and gas trust and another institutional investor for cdn million us million 
as a result of the sale  we recognized a pre tax gain of million 
on october   we completed the sale of substantially all of our british columbia oil and gas properties to calgary  alberta based pengrowth corporation for gross proceeds of approximately cdn million us million 
of the total consideration  we received us million in cash 
the remaining us million was paid by pengrowth corporation s purchase in the open market for an aggregate purchase price of us million and delivery to us of us million in aggregate principal amount of our debt securities 
as a result of the transaction  we recorded a us million pre tax gain on the sale of the properties and a gain on the extinguishment of debt of us million 
we used approximately us million of cash proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under our us billion term loan 
on october   we sold all of our oil and gas properties in drake bay field located in plaquemines parish  louisiana for approximately million to goldking energy corporation 
as a result of the sale  we recognized a pre tax loss of million 
on december   we completed the sale of the megawatt depere energy center in depere  wisconsin 
the facility was sold to wisconsin public service for million  which included million in cash at closing and a million payment due in december as a result of the sale  we recognized a pre tax gain of million

on 
table of contents may   standard and poor s issued a rating of bbb its lowest investment grade level on our secured credit facilities 
we remain on credit watch with negative implications at standard and poor s 
many other issuers in the power generation sector have also been downgraded by one or more of the ratings agencies during this period 
such downgrades can have a negative impact on our liquidity by reducing attractive financing opportunities and increasing the amount of collateral required by trading counterparties 
performance indicators we believe the following factors are important in assessing our ability to continue to fund our growth in the capital markets a our debt to capital ratio  b various interest coverage ratios  c our credit and debt ratings by the rating agencies  d the trading prices of our senior notes in the capital markets  e the price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange  f our anticipated capital requirements over the coming quarters and years  g the profitability of our operations  h our cash balances and remaining capacity under existing revolving credit construction and general purpose credit facilities  i compliance with covenants in existing debt facilities  j progress in raising new or replacement capital  and k the stability of future contractual cash flows 
we believe that our ability to complete the financing transactions described above in difficult conditions affecting the market  and our sector  in general demonstrate our ability to have access to the capital markets on acceptable terms in the future  although availability of capital has tightened significantly throughout the power generation industry and  therefore  there can be no assurance that we will have access to capital in the future as and when we may desire

performance metrics in understanding our business  we believe that certain non gaap financial measures and other performance metrics are particularly important 
these are described below  beginning with the non gaap financial measures average gross profit margin based on non gaap revenue and non gaap cost of revenue 
a high percentage of our revenue in and  to a somewhat lesser extent  in consisted of ces hedging  balancing and optimization activity undertaken primarily to enhance the value of our generating assets see marketing  hedging  optimization  and trading subsection of the business section 
ces s hedging  balancing and optimization activity is primarily accomplished by buying 
table of contents and selling electric power and buying and selling natural gas or by entering into gas financial instruments such as exchange traded swaps or forward contracts 
under sab no 
and eitf no 
 we must show the purchases and sales of electricity and gas for hedging  balancing and optimization activities non trading activities on a gross basis in our statement of operations when we act as a principal  take title to the electricity and gas we purchase for resale  and enjoy the risks and rewards of ownership 
this is notwithstanding the fact that the net gain or loss on certain financial hedging instruments  such as exchange traded natural gas price swaps  is shown as a net item in our gaap financials and that pursuant to eitf no 
 trading activity is now shown net in our statements of operations under trading revenue  net  for all periods presented 
because of the inflating effect on revenue of much of our hedging  balancing and optimization activity  we believe that revenue levels and trends do not reflect our performance as accurately as gross profit  and that it is analytically useful for investors to look at our results on a non gaap basis with all hedging  balancing and optimization activity netted 
this analytical approach nets the sales of purchased power for hedging and optimization with purchased power expense for hedging and optimization and includes that net amount as an adjustment to e s revenue for our generation assets 
similarly  we believe that it is analytically useful for investors to net the sales of purchased gas for hedging and optimization with purchased gas expense for hedging and optimization and include that net amount as an adjustment to fuel expense 
this allows us to look at all hedging  balancing and optimization activity consistently net presentation and better understand our performance trends 
it should be noted that in this non gaap analytical approach  total gross profit does not change from the gaap presentation  but the gross profit margins as a percent of revenue do differ from corresponding gaap amounts because the inflating effects on our gaap revenue of hedging  balancing and optimization activities are removed 
other performance metrics are described below average availability and average capacity factor or operating rate 
availability represents the percent of total hours during the period that our plants were available to run after taking into account the downtime associated with both scheduled and unscheduled outages 
the capacity factor  sometimes called operating rate  is calculated by dividing a total megawatt hours generated by our power plants excluding peakers by the product of multiplying b the weighted average megawatts in operation during the period by c the total hours in the period 
the capacity factor is thus a measure of total actual generation as a percent of total potential generation 
if we elect not to generate during periods when electricity pricing is too low or gas prices too high to operate profitably  the capacity factor will reflect that decision as well as both scheduled and unscheduled outages due to maintenance and repair requirements 
average heat rate for gas fired fleet of power plants expressed in btu s of fuel consumed per kwh generated 
we calculate the average heat rate for our gas fired power plants excluding peakers by dividing a fuel consumed in btu s by b kwh generated 
the resultant heat rate is a measure of fuel efficiency  so the lower the heat rate  the better 
we also calculate a steam adjusted heat rate  in which we adjust the fuel consumption in btu s down by the equivalent heat content in steam or other thermal energy exported to a third party  such as to steam hosts for our cogeneration facilities 
our goal is to have the lowest average heat rate in the industry 
average all in realized electric price expressed in dollars per mwh generated 
our risk management and optimization activities are integral to our power generation business and directly impact our total realized revenues from generation 
accordingly  we calculate the all in realized electric price per mwh generated by dividing a adjusted electricity and steam revenue  which includes capacity revenues  energy revenues  thermal revenues and the spread on sales of purchased electricity for hedging  balancing  and optimization activity  by b total generated mwh s in the period 
average cost of natural gas expressed in dollars per millions of btu s of fuel consumed 
our risk management and optimization activities related to fuel procurement directly impact our total fuel expense 
the fuel costs for our gas fired power plants are a function of the price we pay for fuel 
table of contents purchased and the results of the fuel hedging  balancing  and optimization activities by ces 
accordingly  we calculate the cost of natural gas per millions of btu s of fuel consumed in our power plants by dividing a adjusted fuel expense which includes the cost of fuel consumed by our plants adding back cost of intercompany equity gas from calpine natural gas  which is eliminated in consolidation  and the spread on sales of purchased gas for hedging  balancing  and optimization activity by b the heat content in millions of btu s of the fuel we consumed in our power plants for the period 
average spark spread expressed in dollars per mwh generated 
our risk management activities focus on managing the spark spread for our portfolio of power plants  the spread between the sales price for electricity generated and the cost of fuel 
we calculate the spark spread per mwh generated by subtracting a adjusted fuel expense from b adjusted e s revenue and dividing the difference by c total generated mwh in the period 
the table below presents  side by side  both our gaap and non gaap netted revenue  costs of revenue and gross profit showing the purchases and sales of electricity and gas for hedging  balancing and optimization activity on a net basis

the fair value of derivative commodity instruments included in the table is based on present value adjusted quoted market prices of comparable contracts 
the fair value of electricity derivative commodity instruments after a adverse price change includes the effect of increased power prices versus our derivative forward commitments 
conversely  the fair value of the natural gas derivatives after a adverse price change reflects a general decline in gas prices versus our derivative forward commitments 
derivative commodity instruments offset the price risk exposure of our physical assets 
none of the offsetting physical positions are included in the table above 

table of contents price changes were calculated by assuming an across the board ten percent adverse price change regardless of term or historical relationship between the contract price of an instrument and the underlying commodity price 
in the event of an actual ten percent change in prices  the fair value of our derivative portfolio would typically change by more than ten percent for earlier forward months and less than ten percent for later forward months because of the higher volatilities in the near term and the effects of discounting expected future cash flows 
the primary factors affecting the fair value of our derivatives at any point in time are the volume of open derivative positions mmbtu and mwh  and changing commodity market prices  principally for electricity and natural gas 
the total volume of open gas derivative positions decreased from december   to december   while the total volume of open power derivative positions decreased for the same period 
in that prices for electricity and natural gas are among the most volatile of all commodity prices  there may be material changes in the fair value of our derivatives over time  driven both by price volatility and the changes in volume of open derivative transactions 
under sfas no 
 the change since the last balance sheet date in the total value of the derivatives both assets and liabilities is reflected either in other comprehensive income oci  net of tax  or in the statement of operations as an item gain or loss of current earnings 
as of december   the majority of the balance in accumulated oci represented the unrealized net loss associated with commodity cash flow hedging transactions 
as noted above  there is a substantial amount of volatility inherent in accounting for the fair value of these derivatives  and our results during the year ended december   have reflected this

collateral debt securities the king city operating lease commitment is supported by collateral debt securities that mature serially in amounts equal to a portion of the semi annual lease payment

significant libor increases could have a negative impact on our future interest expense 
our variable rate construction project financing is primarily through two separate credit agreements  calpine construction finance company lp and calpine construction finance company ii  llc 
borrowings under these credit agreements are used exclusively to fund the construction of our power plants 
other variable rate instruments consist primarily of our revolving credit and term loan facilities which are used for general corporate purposes

application of critical accounting policies our financial statements reflect the selection and application of accounting policies which require management to make significant estimates and judgments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 
we believe that the following reflect the more critical accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
fair value of energy marketing and risk management contracts and derivatives generally accepted accounting principles require us to account for certain derivative contracts at fair value 
accounting for derivatives at fair value requires us to make estimates about future prices during periods for which price quotes are not available from sources external to us 
as a result  we are required to rely on internally developed price estimates when external price quotes are unavailable 
our estimates regarding future prices involve a level of uncertainty  and prices actually realized in the future could differ from our estimates 

table of contents we derive our future price estimates during periods where external price quotes are unavailable based on an extrapolation of prices from periods where external price quotes are available 
in performing this extrapolation we estimate future annual prices and adjust them for observed monthly seasonality 
we have quantified a range of likely one year variability in our estimate by placing an upper bound and lower bound around our estimated future prices 
we based our calculation of the likely upper and lower bounds on historically observed actual price trends and a five percent likelihood that actual future prices would be outside the calculated upper or lower bounds within one year 
as of december   we estimate the fair value of our commodity derivative instruments to be million 
if we were to adjust our estimated prices during periods where external price quotes are unavailable to the upper bound and lower bound  the fair value of our commodity derivative instruments would be million and million  respectively 
credit reserves in estimating the fair value of our derivatives  we must take into account the credit risk that our counterparties will not have the financial wherewithal to honor their contract commitments 
in establishing credit risk reserves we take into account historical default rate data published by the rating agencies based on the credit rating of each counterparty where we have realization exposure  as well as other published data and information 
liquidity reserves we value our forward positions at the mid market price  or the price in the middle of the bid ask spread 
this creates a risk that the value reported by us as the fair value of our derivative positions will not represent the realizable value or probable loss exposure of our derivative positions if we are unable to liquidate those positions at the mid market price 
adjusting for this liquidity risk states our derivative assets and liabilities at their most probable value 
we use a two step quantitative and qualitative analysis to determine our liquidity reserve 
in the first step we quantitatively derive an initial liquidity reserve assessment applying the following assumptions in calculating the initial liquidity reserve assessment where we have the capability to cover physical positions with our own assets  we assume no liquidity reserve is necessary because we will not have to cross the bid ask spread in covering the position  we record no reserve against our hedge positions because a high likelihood exists that we will hold our hedge positions to maturity or cover them with our own assets  and where reserves are necessary  we base the reserves on the spreads observed using broker quotes as a starting point 
using these assumptions  we calculate the net notional volume exposure at each location by commodity and multiply the result by one half of the bid ask spread 
the second step involves a qualitative analysis where the initial assessment may be adjusted for qualitative factors such as liquidity spreads observed through recent trading activity  strategies for liquidating open positions  and imprecision in or unavailability of broker quotes due to market illiquidity 
using this quantitative and qualitative information  we estimate the amount of probable liquidity risk exposure to us and we record this estimate as a liquidity reserve 
accounting for long lived assets plant useful lives property  plant and equipment is stated at cost 
the cost of renewals and betterments that extend the useful life of property  plant and equipment are also capitalized 
depreciation is recorded utilizing the straight line method over the estimated original composite useful life  generally years  exclusive of the estimated salvage value  typically 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets  including intangibles we evaluate long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  equity method investments  patents  and specifically identifiable intangibles  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors which could trigger an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets  as compared to the carrying value of the assets 
if an impairment has occurred  the amount of the impairment loss recognized would be determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the fair value was less than the book value 
for equity method investments and assets identified as held for sale  the book value is compared to the estimated fair value to determine if an impairment loss is required 
for equity method investments  we would record a loss when the decline in value is other than temporary 
our assessment regarding the existence of impairment factors is based on market conditions  operational performance and legal factors of our businesses 
our review of factors present and the resulting appropriate carrying value of our intangibles  and other long lived assets are subject to judgments and estimates that management is required to make 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our intangibles  and other long lived assets might be impaired 
turbine impairment charges a significant portion of our overall cost of constructing a power plant is the cost of the gas turbine generators gtgs  steam turbine generators stgs and related equipment collectively the turbines 
the turbines are ordered primarily from three large manufacturers under long term  build to order contracts 
payments are generally made over a two to four year period for each turbine 
the turbine prepayments are included as a component of construction in progress if the turbines are assigned to specific projects probable of being built  and interest is capitalized on such costs 
turbines assigned to specific projects are not evaluated for impairment separately from the project as a whole 
prepayments for turbines that are not assigned to specific projects that are probable of being built are carried in other assets  and interest is not capitalized on such costs 
additionally  our commitments relating to future turbine payments are disclosed in note  commitments and contingencies 
at each reporting date  we assess the total balance of turbine progress payments made to date to determine whether there has been any impairment in the value of the prepayments 
this assessment is based on the relationship between the turbines on order  their allocation to respective construction and development projects and the probability that these projects will be completed 
additionally  to the extent that there are more turbines on order than are allocated to specific construction projects  we must also determine the probability that new projects will be initiated to utilize the turbines or that the turbines will be resold to third parties 
the completion of in progress projects and the initiation of new projects are dependent on our overall liquidity and the availability of funds for capital expenditures 
in assessing the impairment of turbines  we must determine both the realizability of the progress payments to date that have been capitalized  as well as the probability that at future decision dates  we will cancel the turbines  forfeiting the prepayment and incurring the cancellation payment  or will proceed and pay the remaining progress payments in accordance with the original payment schedule 
we apply sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies to evaluate potential future cancellation obligations 
we apply sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets to evaluate turbine progress payments made to date and the carrying value of delivered turbines not assigned to projects 
at the reporting date  if we do not believe that it is probable that the development or construction project associated with each turbine will be financed within the timeframe in which decisions about whether we will need the turbine or not must be made  then the progress payments reservation payments made to 
table of contents date are written off 
additionally  if we believe that it is probable that we will elect the cancellation provisions relating to future decision dates  then the expected future termination payment is also expensed 
oil and gas property valuations successful efforts method of accounting 
we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and natural gas activities 
under the successful efforts method  lease acquisition costs and all development costs are capitalized 
exploratory drilling costs are capitalized until the results are determined 
if proved reserves are not discovered  the exploratory drilling costs are expensed 
other exploratory costs are expensed as incurred 
interest costs related to financing major oil and gas projects in progress are capitalized until the projects are evaluated  or until the projects are substantially complete and ready for their intended use if the projects are evaluated as successful 
the successful efforts method of accounting relies on management s judgment in the designation of wells as either exploratory or developmental  which determines the proper accounting treatment of costs incurred 
during  we drilled net development wells and net exploratory wells  of which net development and one net exploration were successful 
our operational results may be significantly impacted if we decide to drill in a new exploratory area  which will result in increased seismic costs and potentially increased dry hole costs if the wells are determined to be not successful 
successful efforts method of accounting vs 
full cost method of accounting 
under the successful efforts method  unsuccessful exploration well cost  geological and geophysical costs  delay rentals  and general and administrative expenses directly allocable to acquisition  exploration  and development activities are charged to exploration expense as incurred  whereas  under the full cost method these costs are capitalized and amortized over the life of the reserves 
a significant sale would have to occur before a gain or loss would be recognized under the full cost method but  when an entire cost center generally a field is sold under successful efforts method  a gain or loss is recognized 
for impairment evaluation purposes  successful efforts requires that individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows  which are generally on a field by field basis 
under full cost impairment review  all properties in the depreciation  depletion and amortization pools are assessed against a ceiling based on discounted cash flows  with certain adjustments 
though successful efforts and full cost methods are both acceptable under gaap  historically successful efforts is used by most major companies due to such method being more reflective of current operating results due to expensing of certain exploration activities 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
we review our oil and gas properties periodically to determine if impairment of such properties is necessary 
property impairments may occur if a field discovers lower than anticipated reserves or if commodity prices fall below a level that significantly affects anticipated future cash flows on the property 
proved oil and gas property values are reviewed when circumstances suggest the need for such a review and  if required  the proved properties are written down to their estimated fair value 
unproved properties are reviewed quarterly to determine if there has been impairment of the carrying value  with any such impairment charged to expense in the current period 
during  we recorded approximately million in property impairments 
oil and gas reserves 
the process of estimating quantities of proved  proved developed and proved undeveloped crude oil and natural gas reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effect of governmental regulations  operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover costs  all of which may vary considerably from actual results 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and or the rate of depletion of such properties 

table of contents we base estimates of proved  proved developed  and proved undeveloped reserves as of december   on estimates made by netherland  sewell associates inc  independent petroleum consultants  for reserves in the united states  and gilbert laustsen jung associates ltd 
independent petroleum consultants  for reserves in canada 
capitalized interest we capitalize interest using two methods capitalized interest on funds borrowed for specific construction projects and capitalized interest on general corporate funds 
for capitalization of interest on specific funds  we capitalize the interest cost incurred related to debt entered into for specific projects under construction or in the advanced stage of development 
the methodology for capitalizing interest on general funds  consistent with paragraphs and of sfas no 
 capitalization of interest cost  begins with a determination of the borrowings applicable to our qualifying assets 
the basis of this approach is the assumption that the portion of the interest costs that are capitalized on expenditures during an asset s acquisition period could have been avoided if the expenditures had not been made 
this methodology takes the view that if funds are not required for construction then they would have been used to pay off other debt 
we use our best judgment in determining which borrowings represent the cost of financing the acquisition of the assets 
the primary debt instruments included in the rate calculation are the senior notes  our term loan facility and the million and the million revolving credit facilities 
the interest rate is derived by dividing the total interest cost by the average borrowings 
this weighted average interest rate is applied to our average qualifying assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  for additional information about the capitalization of interest expense 
accounting for income taxes to arrive at our worldwide income tax provision significant judgment is required 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of the treatment of capital assets  financing transactions  multistate taxation of operations and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the valuation allowance would not need to be increased to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable 
any increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
we provide for united states income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered permanently invested outside the united states 
at december   we had no cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
our effective income tax rates were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate in all periods is the result of profits calpine corporation and its subsidiaries earned in various tax jurisdictions  both foreign and domestic  that apply a broad range of income tax rates 
the provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to state taxes and earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations and the effect of the treatment by foreign jurisdictions of cross border financings 
future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates  if unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations occur  or if we experience future adverse determinations by taxing authorities after any related litigation 
for calendar year the state tax rate increased over prior years due to a one time adjustment increasing our deferred state taxes and receiving no benefit for foreign 
table of contents losses in our state tax filings 
our foreign taxes at rates other than statutory include the benefit of cross border financings as well as withholding taxes and foreign valuation allowance 
under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
sfas no 
provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based on the weight of available evidence  we have provided a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was based on the historical earnings patterns within individual tax jurisdictions that make it uncertain that we will have sufficient income in the appropriate jurisdictions to realize the full value of the assets 
we will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
at december   we had credit carryforwards  resulting in a million tax benefit  which originated from acceleration of deductions on capital assets 
we expect to utilize all of the credit carryforwards 
we also had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million  which expire between and the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards available are subject to limitations on annual usage 
in addition  we had loss carryforwards in certain foreign subsidiaries  resulting in a tax benefit of approximately million  the majority of which expire by it is expected that they will be fully utilized before expiring 
the deferred tax asset for the federal and state losses  foreign losses  and other prepaid taxes has been offset by a valuation allowance of approximately million 
initial adoption of new accounting standards in sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation and sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure historically  we have accounted for qualified stock compensation under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under apb  we are required to recognize stock compensation as expense only to the extent that there is a difference in value between the market price of the stock being offered to employees and the price those employees must pay to acquire the stock 
the expense measurement methodology provided by apb is commonly referred to as the intrinsic value based method 
to date  our stock compensation program has been based primarily on stock options whose exercise prices are equal to the market price of calpine stock on the date of the stock option grant  consequently  we have historically incurred minimal stock compensation expense 
on august   we announced that  effective january   we intend to prospectively adopt sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes the use of a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation plans 
under sfas no 
 the fair value of a stock option or its equivalent is estimated on the date of grant by using an option pricing model  such as the black scholes model or a binomial model 
the option pricing model selected should take into account  as of the stock option s grant date  the exercise price and expected life of the stock option  the current price of the underlying stock and its expected volatility  expected dividends on the stock  and the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the stock option 
the fair value calculated by this model is then recognized as compensation expense over the period in which the related employee services are rendered 
unless specifically defined within the provisions of the stock option granted  the service period is presumed to begin on the grant date and end when the stock option is fully vested 
depending on the vesting structure of the stock option and other variables that are built into the option pricing model  the fair value of the stock option is recognized over the service period using either a straight line method the single option approach or a more conservative  accelerated method the multiple option approach 
recognizing that employees are entitled to portions of a given stock option grant at different points throughout the vesting period  we have chosen the multiple option approach  which we have used historically for pro forma disclosure purposes 
the multiple option approach views one four year option grant as four separate sub grants  each representing of the total number of stock options granted 
the first sub 
table of contents grant vests over one year  the second sub grant vests over two years  the third sub grant vests over three years  and the fourth sub grant vests over four years 
under this scenario  over of the total fair value of the stock option grant is recognized during the first year of the vesting period  and nearly of the total fair value of the stock option grant is recognized by the end of the second year of the vesting period 
by contrast  if we were to apply the single option approach  only and of the total fair value of the stock option grant would be recognized as compensation expense by the end of the first and second years of the vesting period  respectively 
we have selected the black scholes model  primarily because it is the most commonly recognized options pricing model among us based corporations 
nonetheless  we believe this model tends to overstate the true fair value of our employee stock options in that our options cannot be freely traded  have vesting requirements  and are subject to blackout periods during which  even if vested  they cannot be traded 
we will monitor valuation trends and techniques as more companies adopt sfas no 
and review our choices as appropriate in the future 
the key assumption in our black scholes model is the expected life of the stock option  because it is this figure that drives our expected volatility calculation  as well as our risk free interest rate 
the expected life of the option relies on two factors the option s vesting period and the expected term that an employee holds the option once it has vested 
there is no single method described by sfas no 
for predicting future events such as how long an employee holds on to an option or what the expected volatility of a company s stock price will be  the facts and circumstances are unique to different companies and depend on factors such as historical employee stock option exercise patterns  significant changes in the market place that could create a material impact on a company s stock price in the future  and changes in a company s stock based compensation structure 
we will base our expected option terms on historical employee exercise patterns 
we have segregated our employees into four different categories based on the fact that different groups of employees within our company have exhibited different stock exercise patterns in the past  usually based on employee rank and income levels 
therefore  we have concluded that we will perform separate black scholes calculations for four employee groups executive officers  senior vice presidents  vice presidents  and all other employees 
we will compute our expected stock price volatility based on our stock s historical movements 
for each employee group  we will measure the volatility of our stock over a period that equals the expected term of the option 
in the case of our executive officers  this means we will measure our stock price volatility dating back to our public inception in  because these employees are expected to hold their options for over years after the options have fully vested 
in the case of other employees  volatility will only be measured dating back years 
in the short run  this will cause other employees to generate a higher volatility figure than the other company employee groups because our stock price has fluctuated significantly in the past four years 
as of december   the volatility for our employee groups ranged from 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas no 

sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for companies that voluntarily change their accounting for stock based compensation from the less preferred intrinsic value based method to the more preferred fair value based method 
prior to its amendment  sfas no 
required that companies enacting a voluntary change in accounting principle from the apb methodology could only do so on a prospective basis  no adoption or transition provisions were established to allow for a restatement of prior period financial statements 
companies adopting sfas no 
were required to provide a pro forma disclosure of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method had been used to account for their stock based compensation for all periods presented within their financial statements 
sfas no 
provides two additional transition options to report the change in accounting principle the modified prospective method and the retroactive restatement method 
we will use the prospective method in our implementation of sfas no 
based on our black scholes assumptions described above  and based on our sip grant that occurred in january  we anticipate that adopting the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
will result in a pre tax charge of million to compensation expense during see note to the consolidated 
table of contents financial statements for additional information related to the adoption of sfas no 
and the pro forma impact that it would have had on our net income for the years ended december   and sfas accounting for asset retirement obligations in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
applies to fiscal years beginning after june  and amends sfas no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies 
this standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development or normal use of the assets and requires that a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized when incurred  recorded at fair value and classified as a liability in the balance sheet 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity will capitalize the cost and increase the carrying value of the related long lived asset 
asset retirement obligations represent future liabilities  and  as a result  accretion expense will be accrued on this liability until the obligation is satisfied 
at the same time  the capitalized cost will be depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related asset 
at the settlement date  the entity will settle the obligation for its recorded amount or recognize a gain or loss upon settlement 
we adopted the new rules on asset retirement obligations on january  as required by the new rules  we recorded liabilities equal to the present value of expected future asset retirement obligations at january  we identified obligations related to operating gas fired power plants  geothermal power plants and oil and gas properties 
the liabilities are partially offset by increases in net assets  net of accumulated depreciation  recorded as if the provisions of the statement had been in effect at the date the obligation was incurred  which is generally the start of commercial operations for the facility 
based on current information and assumptions we expect to record an additional long term liability of million  an additional asset within property  plant and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  of million  and a gain to income due to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million  net of taxes which entries includes the reversal of site dismantlement and restoration costs previously expensed in accordance with sfas no 
due to the complexity of this accounting standard  and the number of assumptions used in the calculations  we may make adjustments to these estimates prior to the filing of form q for the quarter ending march  fin guarantors accounting and disclosure for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others in november the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees 
fin also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  it must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee  including its ongoing obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event that specified triggering events or conditions occur 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of fin s initial recognition and measurement provisions on our consolidated financial statements 
the disclosure requirements for fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december   and have been incorporated into our december   disclosures of guarantees in the notes to consolidated financial statements

table of contents impact of recent accounting pronouncements sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fasb in recent years has issued numerous new accounting standards that have already taken effect or will soon impact us 
in note to our consolidated financial statements  we invite your attention to a discussion of ten new standards  emerging issues and interpretations under the section entitled new accounting pronouncements 
below is a detailed discussion of how we apply sfas no 
since this accounting standard has a profound impact on how we account for our energy contracts and transactions 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
an amendment of fasb statement no 
 and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
we currently hold six classes of derivative instruments that are impacted by the new pronouncement foreign currency swaps  interest rate swaps  forward interest rate agreements  commodity financial instruments  commodity contracts  and physical options 
consistent with the requirements of sfas no 
 we evaluate all of our contracts to determine whether or not they qualify as derivatives under the accounting pronouncement 
for a given contract  there are typically three steps we use to determine its proper accounting treatment 
first  based on the terms and conditions of the contract  as well as the applicable guidelines established by sfas no 
 we identify the contract as being either a derivative or non derivative contract 
second  if the contract is not a derivative  we further identify its specific classification eg whether or not it qualifies as a lease and apply the appropriate non derivative accounting treatment 
alternatively  if the contract does qualify as a derivative under the guidance of sfas no 
 we evaluate whether or not it qualifies for the normal purchases and sales exception as described below 
if the contract qualifies for the exception  we apply the traditional accrual accounting treatment 
finally  if the contract qualifies as a derivative and does not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception  we apply the accounting treatment required by sfas no 
 which is 
table of contents outlined below in further detail 
the diagram below illustrates the process we use for the purposes of identifying the classification and subsequent accounting treatment of our contracts classification flow chart as an independent power producer primarily focused on generation of electricity using gas fired turbines  our natural physical commodity position is short fuel ie  natural gas consumer and long power capacity ie  electricity seller 
additionally  we also have a natural long crude position due to our petroleum reserves 
to manage forward exposure to price fluctuation  we execute commodity derivative contracts as defined by sfas no 
as we apply sfas no 
 derivatives can receive one of four treatments depending on associated circumstances exemption from sfas no 
accounting treatment if these contracts qualify as normal purchases and sales contracts  fair value hedges  cash flow hedges  or undesignated derivatives 
normal purchases and sales normal purchases and sales  as defined by paragraph b 
of sfas no 
and amended by sfas no 
 are exempt from sfas no 
accounting treatment 
as a result  these contracts are not required to be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair values and any fluctuations in these values are not required to be reported within earnings 
probability of physical delivery from our generation plants  in the case of electricity sales  and to our generation plants  in the case of natural gas contracts  is required over the life of the contract within reasonable tolerances 
on june   the fasb cleared sfas no 
implementation issue no 
c dealing with a proposed electric industry normal purchases and sales exception for capacity sales transactions the eligibility of option contracts in electricity for the normal purchases and normal sales exception 
on december   the fasb revised the criteria for qualifying for the normal exception 
as a result of 
table of contents issue no 
c  as revised  certain power purchase and or sale agreements that are structured as capacity sales contracts are now eligible to qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception 
because we are long power capacity  we often enter into capacity sales contracts as a means to recover the costs incurred from maintaining and operating our power plants as well as the costs directly associated with the generation and sale of electricity to our customers 
under issue no 
c  a capacity sales contract qualifies for the normal purchases and sales exception subject to certain conditions 
a majority of our capacity sales contracts qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception 
cash flow hedges and fair value hedges within the energy industry  cash flow and fair value hedge transactions typically use the same types of standard transactions ie  offered for purchase sale in over the counter markets or commodity exchanges 
fair value hedges as further defined in sfas no 
 fair value hedge transactions hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of either all or a specific portion of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment 
the accounting treatment for fair value hedges requires reporting both the changes in fair values of a hedged item the underlying risk and the hedging instrument the derivative designated to offset the underlying risk on both the balance sheet and the income statement 
on that basis  when a firm commitment is associated with a hedge instrument that attains effectiveness under the effectiveness criteria outlined in sfas no 
 there is no net earnings impact because the earnings caused by the changes in fair value of the hedged item will move in an equal  but opposite  amount as the earnings caused by the changes in fair value of the hedging instrument 
in other words  the earnings volatility caused by the underlying risk factor will be neutralized because of the hedge 
for example  if we want to manage the price risk ie the risk that market electric rates will rise  making a fixed price contract less valuable associated with all or a portion of a fixed price power sale that has been identified as a normal transaction as described above  we might create a fair value hedge by purchasing fixed price power 
from that date and time forward until delivery  the change in fair value of the hedged item and hedge instrument will be reported in earnings with asset liability offsets on the balance sheet 
if there is effectiveness  there is no net earnings impact 
if there is less than effectiveness  the fair value change of the hedged item the underlying risk and the hedging instrument the derivative will likely be different and the ineffectiveness will result in a net earnings impact 
cash flow hedges as further defined in sfas no 
 cash flow hedge transactions hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows ie  in our case  the price variability of forecasted purchases of gas and sales of power  as well as interest rate and foreign exchange rate exposure 
in the case of cash flow hedges  the hedged item the underlying risk is generally unrecognized ie  not recorded on the balance sheet prior to delivery  and any changes in this fair value  therefore  will not be recorded within earnings 
conceptually  if a cash flow hedge is effective  this means that a variable  such as movement in power prices  has been effectively fixed  so that any fluctuations will have no net result on either cash flows or earnings 
therefore  if the changes in fair value of the hedged item are not recorded in earnings  then the changes in fair value of the hedging instrument the derivative must also be excluded from the income statement  or else a one sided net impact on earnings will be reported  despite the fact that the establishment of the effective hedge results in no net economic impact 
to prevent such a scenario from occurring  sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge be recorded as an asset or liability on the balance sheet  but with the offset reported as part of other comprehensive income oci  to the extent that the hedge is 
table of contents effective 
similar to fair value hedges  any ineffectiveness portion will be reflected in earnings 
the diagram below illustrates the process used to account for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges cash flow hedges flow chart certain contracts could either qualify for exemption from sfas no 
accounting as normal purchases or sales or be designated as effective hedges 
our marketing and fuels groups generally transact with load serving entities and other end users of electricity and with fuel suppliers  respectively  in physical contracts where delivery is expected 
these transactions are structured as normal purchases and sales  when possible and  if the normal exception is not allowed  we seek to structure the transactions as cash flow hedges 
conversely  our ces risk management desks generally transact in over the counter or exchange traded contracts  in hedging transactions 
these transactions are designated as hedges when possible  notwithstanding the fact that some might qualify as normal purchases or sales 
undesignated derivatives the fair values and changes in fair values of undesignated derivatives are recorded in earnings  with the corresponding offsets recorded as derivative assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
we have the following types of undesignated transactions transactions are executed at a location where we do not have an associated natural long generation capacity or short fuel consumption requirements position of sufficient quantity for the entire term of the transaction eg  power sales where we do not own generating assets or intend to acquire transmission rights for delivery from other assets for a portion of the contract term  and transactions executed with the intent to profit from short term price movements discontinuance de designation of hedge treatment prospectively consistent with paragraphs and of sfas no 
in circumstances where we believe the hedge relationship is no longer 
table of contents necessary  we will remove the hedge designation and close out the hedge positions by entering into an equal and offsetting derivative position 
prospectively  the two derivative positions should generally have no net earnings impact because the changes in their fair values are offsetting 
accumulated other comprehensive income accumulated other comprehensive income aoci includes the following components i unrealized pre tax gains losses  net of reclassification to earnings adjustments  from effective cash flow hedges as designated pursuant to sfas no 
 see note to the consolidated financial statements  ii unrealized pre tax gains losses that result from the translation of foreign subsidiaries balance sheets from the foreign functional currency to our consolidated reporting currency us  iii other comprehensive income from equity method investees  and iv the taxes associated with the unrealized gains losses from items i  ii and iii
