critical accounting policies in order to prepare the company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management was required to make estimates and assumptions that affected the amounts reported in these statements 
there are uncertainties inherent in making these estimates and assumptions which could materially affect the results of operations and financial position 
management considers the allowance for loan losses and liabilities for retirement plans to be critical accounting policies 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is sensitive to changes in current economic conditions that may make it difficult for borrowers to meet their contractual obligations 
a severe downward trend in the economy  regional or national  may require the company to increase the allowance for loan losses resulting in a negative impact on its results of operations and financial condition 
the company has a variety of pension and retirement plans 
liabilities under these plans rely on estimates of future salary increases  numbers of employees and employee retention  discount rates and long term rates of investment return 
changes in these assumptions due to changes in the financial markets  the economy or the company s own operations may result in material changes to the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the following discussion and analysis focuses on and reviews the company s results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended december  and the financial condition of the company as of december  and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and other financial data presented elsewhere herein

sale of credit card portfolio and servicing business in prior to  the company serviced its own credit card portfolio as well as the credit card portfolios for several smaller financial institutions 
in  the company determined that it would no longer engage in the consumer credit card servicing business and that it would sell the business as well as its existing consumer credit card balances to mbna america bank  na  an organization widely recognized as an industry leader 
the decision to discontinue this activity was driven by the fact that the consumer credit card business  including both card issuance and account servicing  has increasingly become a commodity operation that requires great scale 
management also expected that its credit card customers would receive a broader array of account benefits and services under mbna s programs after the sale  and such has been the case 
the sale  which resulted in a net gain of net of tax  was completed in the third quarter of the company continues to manage its merchant credit card and debit card programs

results of operations the following analysis of net interest income  the provision for loan losses  noninterest income  noninterest expense and income taxes  highlights the factors that are primarily responsible for the company s results of operations for and the prior two years 
i 
net interest income tax equivalent basis net interest income represents the difference between interest and dividends earned on loans  securities and other earning assets and interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds 
changes in net interest income result from changes in the level and mix of earning assets and sources of funds volume and changes in the yields earned and interest rates paid rate 
net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets 
net interest income may also be described as the product of average earning assets and the net interest margin

analysis of changes in net interest income the following table presents net interest income components on a tax equivalent basis and reflects changes between periods attributable to movement in either the average daily balances or average rates for both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

this contrasted with the prior year  when rate changes generated a million increase in net interest income out of a total increase of million 
the following items have a major impact on changes in net interest income due to rate general interest rate changes  the ratio of the company s rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap during periods of interest rate changes and the level of nonperforming loans 
the federal reserve board attempts to influence prevailing federal funds and prime interest rates and sets changes to the federal reserve bank discount rate 
the following chart presents rate changes in recent years key interest rate changes federal date discount rate funds rate prime rate november  
december  november  october  september  august  june  may  april  march  january  january  may  march  february  november  august  june  the company s net interest income  for the past several years  has been very sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as indicated in the table above  prevailing interest rates economy wide began to increase in the second half of through the second half of this marked a turnaround from a long period of flat or slowly declining prevailing interest rates 
the rate hikes had a moderate negative impact on the company s financial results for  which continued to show decreases from prior periods in the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on earning liabilities  as well as decreases in the company s net interest spread and net interest margin 
however  the full and negative impact of rising rates was felt in  when the decrease in net interest income due to rates was significant 
in the first quarter of  the federal reserve board reversed direction and began decreasing short term interest rates rapidly and significantly in response to perceived weakening in the economy 
by december  the total decrease in prevailing short term interest rates for the year was basis points 
after eleven months with no rate changes  the federal reserve board decreased rates another basis points in november as a result  the company experienced a decrease in the cost of deposits in all quarters of and although decreases in deposit rates began to be experienced in the first quarter of  the company did not experience a decrease in the average yield in its loan portfolio until the second quarter of since that time  yields on the loan portfolio have decreased each successive quarter in and  as well 
see the loan portfolio section in the discussion of financial condition later on in this report  for a more complete analysis of yield trends in the loan portfolio 
when the federal reserve board decreased short term interest rates by basis points in november  this decrease had a limited impact on the company s deposit rates  because rates on several of the company s deposit products  such as savings and now accounts  were already priced at such low levels that a basis point decrease in rates was not practical or sustainable  although the company did lower rates to a much smaller extent on certain non maturity deposit products 
most important  the decreasing rate environment had a positive impact on net interest income during and  as net interest margins increased both years 
the net interest margin for was  an increase of basis points from the margin for the net interest spread between the two years increased by basis points 
these increases in margin and spread were attributable to the fact that during a period of decreasing market rates the company s paying liabilities repriced downward at a faster rate than its earning assets 
in turn  a major factor influencing this development was the relocation of a significant dollar amount of maturing time deposits into other lower cost deposit accounts  a relocation that often accompanies falling interest rates but also often proves temporary 
in both rising and falling rate environments  the company faces significant competitive pricing pressures in its marketplace for both deposits and loans  and thus ultimately both assets and liabilities may be expected to reprice proportionately in response to changes in market rates 
the net interest margin for was  an increase of basis points from the margin for the net interest spread between the two years increased by basis points 
as in  these significant increases in margin and spread were attributable to the fact that during a period of decreasing market rates the company s paying liabilities repriced downward at a faster rate than its earning assets 
a discussion of the impact on net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates vis a vis the repricing patterns of the company s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is included later in this report under item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
changes in net interest income due to volume average balances dollars in thousands years ended december  change from prior year amount amount earning assets      interest bearing liabilities      demand deposits      total assets      earning assets to total assets 

in general  changes in the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities will result in corresponding changes in net interest income 
that is  as assets and liabilities increase  so will net interest income 
however  changes due to volume can be enhanced or restricted by shifts within the relative mix of earning assets or interest bearing liabilities between instruments of different rates 
the change in net interest income due to changes in volume was an increase of million in and an increase of million in during  average earning assets increased million  an increase of 
average paying liabilities grew at a somewhat slower pace  increasing by million  or 
the combined effect of these changes in volume was to increase net interest income by approximately  before giving effect to the positive impact on net interest income resulting from the change in interest rates discussed in the previous section 
during  the company experienced its growth in average earning assets primarily within the investment portfolio which accounted for approximately of the increase and secondarily within the loan portfolio approximately 
while it is the intention of the company ultimately to invest the greatest portion of its earning assets into high quality loans  most of the increase in the sources of funds from december  to december  was redeployed  at least for the present  into the investment securities portfolio 
as reported on the consolidated statement of cash flows  the cash flow received from the maturities and calls of securities in the available for sale portfolio amounted to million for most of these cash flows are from the monthly amortization of mortgage backed securities 
among other needs  this cash flow is available to fund loan growth or for redeployment in the available for sale portfolio 
the fastest growing segment of the loan portfolio for several years preceding was indirect consumer loans  which are primarily auto loans financed through local dealerships from whom the company acquires the dealer paper 
while this segment still represents the largest portion of the loan portfolio  the outstanding balances of indirect loans remained little changed at year end from year end and for  the average balances of indirect loans were actually million below the average balances for  as the portfolio experienced a net decrease prior to recovering in the fourth quarter of the increase in the average loan balances from to was attributable to the residential real estate million and the commercial loan million portfolios 
the company s million growth in average paying liabilities in was experienced primarily in traditional banking deposit products  which increased by million  or  from year end to year end  and secondarily in federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings  which increased by million  or  from year end to year end the increase in deposit balances during was generated by the company s pre existing branch network  although the company s saratoga national bank and trust company franchise did open its third branch the second branch in saratoga springs at the beginning of no other branches were added or acquired in during  average earning assets increased million  an increase of 
average paying liabilities grew at a somewhat slower pace  increasing by million  or 
the combined effect was to increase net interest income by approximately  before giving effect to the positive impact on net interest income resulting from the change in interest rates discussed in the previous section 
in unlike in the company experienced its growth in average earning assets principally within the loan portfolio 
during  the company securitized approximately million of residential real estate loan balances and retained ownership of the resulting mortgage backed securities for the purpose of providing additional liquidity and collateral for pledging purposes 
without the securitization  increases in loan balances would have represented over of the increase in average earning assets between the two years 
the outstanding balances of indirect consumer loans remained little changed at year end from year end during  adjusted for reductions of loans through securitizations  residential real estate loans increased million  or 
commercial loans increased by million  or  representing the other area of significant growth within the loan portfolio 
the company s growth in average paying liabilities in was experienced both in traditional banking deposit products  which increased by million  or  from year end to year end  and in borrowings  which increased by million  or  from year end to year end the increase in deposit balances during was generated by the company s pre existing branch network 
no branches were added or acquired in the primary source of new borrowings by the company in was advances from the fhlb see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
increases in the volume of loans and deposits  as well as yields and costs by type  are discussed later in this report under item c financial condition 
ii 
provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses management considers its accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy given the inherent uncertainty involved in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio  and the material effect that such judgments can have on the company s results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  as well as the discussion below  for a description of the company s policy with respect to estimating the level of the allowance for loan losses 
through the provision for loan losses  an allowance reserve is maintained for estimated loan losses 
actual loan losses are charged against this allowance when loans are deemed uncollectible 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers various risk factors influencing asset quality 
the analysis is performed on a loan by loan basis for impaired and large balance loans  and by portfolio type for smaller balance homogeneous loans 
this analysis is based on judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may influence borrowers financial conditions or prospects 
the determination of actual provisions for loan losses on an ongoing basis is largely influenced by the prevailing level of nonperforming loans  the level of loans actually charged off against the allowance for loan losses during the prior periods  contemporary changes in the mix and volume of loan categories within the loan portfolio and overall changes in the size of the portfolio 
the quality of the company s loan portfolio remains strong and  to date  has not been negatively affected either by the loan growth experienced in recent periods or by the recent weakening in the national and regional economy 
at period end  the ratio of nonperforming loans loans days or more and accruing interest plus nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total loans was 
for the company 
the september  ratio for the company s peer group was 
while management believes that the year end allowance was adequate under the circumstances  there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments  including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the economy  might not lead to increased provisions to the allowance or a higher incidence of loan charge offs 
the provision for loan losses was million for  virtually unchanged from during  loan losses charged against the allowance  net of recoveries  were thousand  a decrease of thousand  or  from the amount 
during the second quarter of  the company charged off thousand on one commercial loan 
disregarding this item  net charge offs for increased by thousand  or  over net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding was 
for net charge offs  on an annualized basis  for the company s peer group at september  was 
of average loans  or higher than the company s ratio 
if the current economic recession continues or worsens  management anticipates that net charge offs will exceed the levels experienced in recent years 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  a decrease of thousand  or  from the balance at year end the decrease was primarily attributable to one thousand commercial loan that was designated as nonperforming at year end  which was paid off in full by the borrower during december while nonperforming loans and net loans charged off improved in  as compared to  the continued growth in the loan portfolio resulted in the provision for loan losses remaining consistent with at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or  of total loans  as compared to million  or of total loans at december  the allowance for loan losses represented of the amount of nonperforming loans at december   as compared to of nonperforming loans at december  during  loan losses charged against the allowance  net of recoveries  were million  an increase of thousand  or  from the prior year amount 
during the second quarter of  the company charged off thousand on one commercial loan 
management believes that the factors that led to this charge off were unique and isolated and are not indicative of any emerging pattern of increasing charge offs above historical levels 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding was 
for the provision for loan losses  as a percentage of average loans outstanding was 
for net charge offs  on an annualized basis  for the company s peer group at september  was 
of average loans  or higher than the company s ratio 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from the balance at year end the increase was primarily attributable to two commercial loans  totaling million  which were placed on nonaccrual status during the fourth quarter of the provision for loan losses was million for  an increase of thousand  or  from at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  essentially unchanged from the balance at december  at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans 
the allowance for loan losses represented of the amount of nonperforming loans at that date 
during  loan losses charged against the allowance  net of recoveries  were thousand  or  of average loans for the period  an increase of thousand  or  from the prior year amount 
the principal reason for the increase in net loan losses in as compared with was a recovery of thousand in the period related to the final repayment of a large commercial loan 
excluding the large recovery  net loan losses for would have exceeded those for  and would have represented 
of average loans 
the provision for loan losses charged to expense for was million  or  of average loans for the period

other income the majority of other ie  noninterest income constitutes fee income from services  principally fees and commissions from fiduciary services  deposit account service charges  computer processing fees to correspondents and other recurring fee income 
net gains or losses on the sale of securities available for sale is another category of other income

for  income from fiduciary activities decreased thousand  or  from at year end  the market value of assets under trust administration and investment management amounted to million  a decrease of million  or  from year end the decrease in the market value of assets under trust administration and investment management principally reflected the general decline in the equity markets during  which more than offset the increase in number of accounts under administration during the year 
fiduciary account fees  in general  are tied to the value of assets under administration 
income from fiduciary activities includes income from funds under investment management in the company advised north country funds  which include the north country equity growth fund ncegx and the north country intermediate bond fund ncbdx 
on a combined basis  these funds reached a market value of million at december  the funds were introduced in march  and are advised by the company s subsidiary  north country investment advisors  inc currently  the funds are owned almost entirely by qualified employee benefit plan accounts 
the company began to offer these funds on a retail basis through its branches during included as an investor in the funds is the company s pension plan  which owns shares in the funds with a market value of million at december  fees for other services to customers include deposit account service charges  credit card and debit card merchant processing fees  safe deposit box fees and loan servicing fees 
these fees amounted to million in  an increase of thousand  or  from over half of the increase was attributable to increases in deposit service charges 
an increase in credit card and debit card merchant processing fees also made a significant contribution to the total increase in fees for other services to customers 
during  the company realized net securities gains of thousand on the sale of million from its available for sale portfolio 
the primary purpose of the sales were to restructure the maturity profile of the investment portfolio 
other operating income includes net gains on the sale of loans and other real estate owned  if any  as well as other miscellaneous revenues 
for  other operating income increased thousand  or 
the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in data processing servicing fee income received from one upstate new york bank and a one time benefit from the demutualization of an insurance company for the company s group employee insurance trust 
from to  total other income increased thousand  or 
without regard to net securities transactions and the net gain on the sale of the credit card portfolio  total other income was million for and million for  an increase of thousand  or 
for  income from fiduciary activities increased thousand  or  from the increase was in large part attributable to an increase in the number of trust accounts under administration and investment management which more than offset the general decline in the equity markets and consequent negative impact on the value of assets under administration 
at year end  the market value of assets under trust administration and investment management amounted to million  a decrease of million  or  from year end fees for other services to customers include deposit account service charges  credit card and debit card merchant processing fees  safe deposit box fees and loan servicing fees 
these fees amounted to million in  an increase of thousand  or  from during  the company realized net securities gains of thousand on the sale of million from its available for sale portfolio 
in the past  the primary component of other operating income was fees earned on servicing credit card portfolios for correspondent banks 
with the sale of the credit card portfolio at the end of the third quarter of  the company also discontinued servicing credit card portfolios for most of its correspondent banks 
thus  income from servicing credit card portfolios decreased significantly between the two years  falling to thousand in from thousand in beginning in  the company discontinued servicing the remainder of the correspondent banks portfolios 
the loss in income resulting from this discontinuation of business was accompanied by similar reductions in expense also attributable to this discontinuation 
other operating income also includes net gains on the sale of loans and other real estate owned  as well as other miscellaneous revenues 
for  other operating income decreased thousand  or 
disregarding the credit card servicing component  other operating income actually increased by thousand  or 
the increase was primarily attributable to data processing servicing fee income received from one upstate new york bank 
the sale of the credit card portfolio in was discussed in the overview at the beginning of item iv 
other expense other ie  noninterest expense is a means of measuring the delivery cost of services  products and business activities of the company 
the key components of other expense are presented in the following table 
analysis of other expense dollars in thousands years ended december  change from prior year amount amount salaries and employee benefits      occupancy expense of premises  net    furniture and equipment expense    other operating expense     total other expense     other expense for amounted to million  an increase of thousand  or  from this comparison was significantly affected by a change in accounting principles between the two periods 
the significant change was the discontinuance in of goodwill amortization upon the adoption of sfas no 
 retroactive to january  goodwill amortization for was thousand  but was for disregarding goodwill amortization  the increase in other expense between the two years would have been substantially higher  specifically  million  or a increase 
one comparative measure of operating expenses for financial institutions is the efficiency ratio 
the efficiency ratio a ratio where lower is better is calculated as the ratio of other expense to the sum of tax equivalent net interest income and other income 
excluded from the calculation are goodwill amortization and any net securities gains or losses

the company s ratio also compares favorably to the year to date ratio for the company s peer group of as of september  salaries and employee benefits increased million  or  from to salaries increased thousand  or  from to the increase was attributable to normal merit pay increases  as well as to the hiring of additional employees late in principally to staff the new west avenue office of saratoga national bank and trust company in saratoga springs  new york  and the company s new insurance agency subsidiary 
employee benefits increased thousand  or during the period 
in  all categories of employee benefits experienced increases from  except incentive compensation  which decreased slightly

securities held to maturity are debt securities that the company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity  such securities are stated at amortized cost 
debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of sale in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
debt and equity securities not classified as either held to maturity or trading securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported net of taxes in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss

there is a time lag  however  between the federal reserve s changes in prevailing rates and the impact of those changes on the company s loan portfolio 
as discussed above in this report in the section entitled changes in net interest income due to rate  prevailing interest rates  after increasing steadily throughout  decreased steadily in and in response to the federal reserve board s sizable rate cutting actions during all four quarters of and in november the yield on the company s loan portfolio has been and will continue to be affected by these rate changes  although the decrease in average yields on loans and other earning assets has lagged behind the decrease in average rates paid on deposits 
loan yields began to fall over the second half of and in all quarters of many of the loans in the commercial portfolio have variable rates tied to prime or us treasury indices 
additionally  there is a significant amount of cash flow from normal amortization and prepayments in all loan categories  and this cash flow reprices at current rates as new loans are generated at the lower current yields 
the following table indicates the respective maturities and repricing structure of the company s commercial  financial and agricultural loans and its real estate construction loans at december  for purposes of determining relevant maturities  loans are assumed to mature at but not before their scheduled repayment dates as required by contractual terms

in addition to these instruments  the company has issued lines of credit to customers  including home equity lines of credit  commitments for residential and commercial construction loans and other personal and commercial lines of credit  which also may be unfunded or only partially funded from time to time 
commercial lines  generally issued for a period of one year  are usually extended to provide for the working capital requirements of the borrower 
at december   the company had outstanding unfunded loan commitments in the aggregate amount of approximately million

risk elements nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans the company designates loans as nonaccrual when the payment of interest and or principal is due and unpaid for a designated period generally days or when the likelihood of the full repayment of principal and interest is  in the opinion of management  uncertain 
under the uniform retail credit classification and account management policy  established by banking regulators  fixed maturity consumer loans must generally be charged off no later than when days past due 
open end credits and residential real estate loans should be charged off no later than when days past due 
commercial loans are evaluated for charge off on a loan by loan basis 
there were no material commitments to lend additional funds on outstanding nonaccrual loans at december  loans past due days or more and still accruing interest  as identified in the table presented earlier in part ii  item bii  labeled summary of the allowance and provision for loan losses  are those loans which were contractually past due days or more but because of expected repayments  were still accruing interest 
sfas no 
requires that all impaired loans  except for large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  be measured based on i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  ii the loan s observable market price or iii the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the company applies the provisions of sfas no 
to all impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans over  and to all restructured loans 
allowances for losses for the remaining smaller balance loans are evaluated under sfas no 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 the company determines impairment for collateralized loans based on fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell 
for other loans  impairment is determined by comparing the recorded value of the loan to the present value of the expected cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
the company determines the interest income recognition method for impaired loans on a loan by loan basis 
based upon the borrowers payment histories and cash flow projections  interest recognition methods include full accrual or cash basis 
at december  one commercial loan was considered impaired under sfas no 
with a recorded investment of thousand  an allowance for loan losses of thousand and a net carrying amount of thousand 
this loan was included in nonaccrual loans in the schedule of nonperforming loans 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  a decrease of thousand  or  from the balance at year end the decrease was primarily attributable to one thousand commercial loan designated nonperforming at year end  which was paid off by the borrower during december total nonperforming loans at year end represented 
of period end loans  a decrease from 
at year end the ratio of nonperforming loans to average loans for the company s peer group at september  was  or higher than the company s ratio at december  during income recognized on year end balances of nonaccrual loans was thousand 
income that would have been recognized during that period on nonaccrual loans if all such had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for part of the period was thousand 
at december   two commercial loans were considered impaired loans under sfas no 
with a recorded investment of million  an allowance for loan losses of thousand and a net carrying amount of thousand 
these loans were included in nonaccrual loans in the schedule of nonperforming loans above 
there were no impaired loans at december  or within the scope of sfas no 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from the balance at year end the increase was attributable to the two impaired commercial loans described in the preceding paragraph  which were placed on nonaccrual status during the fourth quarter of the allowance for loan losses  at december   included specific impairment allowances of thousand for these two loans 
total nonperforming loans at year end represented 
of period end loans  an increase from 
at year end the ratio of nonperforming loans to average loans for the company s peer group at september  was  or higher than the company s ratio at december  during income recognized on year end balances of nonaccrual loans was thousand 
income that would have been recognized during that period on nonaccrual loans if all such had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for part of the period was thousand 
at december   nonaccrual loans amounted to million  a decrease of thousand from december  loans past due or more days and still accruing interest amounted to thousand at december   a decrease of thousand from december  total nonperforming loans at year end represented 
of period end loans  a decrease from 
at year end during income recognized on year end balances of nonaccrual loans was thousand 
income that would have been recognized during that period on nonaccrual loans if all such had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for part of the period was thousand 
potential problem loans on at least a quarterly basis  the company applies an internal credit quality rating system to commercial loans that are either past due or fully performing loans which may exhibit certain characteristics that could reflect a potential weakness 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the likely amount of future principal and interest payments are expected to be less than the contractual amounts  even if such loans are not days past due 
because of this approach toward placing commercial loans on nonaccrual status  the company normally does not identify any significant number of potential problem loans in its portfolio that do not otherwise meet one of the classifications discussed above eg  nonaccrual  troubled debt restructurings 
at year end  the company had identified only one credit that  although still accruing interest  exhibited such significant weakness as to warrant mention as a potential problem 
a portion of this commercial credit  totaling thousand  had been placed on nonaccrual status  while the remaining amount of the credit  totaling million  was identified as a potential problem loan  but continues to accrue interest 
this same loan was identified as a potential problem loan at december   when the amount of the loan on nonaccrual status was thousand 
the balance was reduced during by cash payments from the borrower 
late in the first quarter of  a commercial borrower announced plans to discontinue its principal and  potentially  all aspects of its business operation 
the borrower is currently indebted to the company s lead bank in the aggregate amount of million through three separate loans 
two loans totaling million are essentially fully collateralized by high grade  liquid  marketable securities 
these two loans are further collateralized by a blanket lien on equipment and various other assets 
a third loan with a current balance of thousand is secured by commercial real estate having an estimated market value significantly in excess of the loan balance 
all loans contain cross collateralization provisions 
there are no commitments to extend additional credit to the borrower 
consequently  the company believes that its risk of credit loss to this borrower  at this time  is very limited 
the company is closely monitoring the matter and is in regular communication with management of the borrower 
the balance of other non current loans to which interest income was being accrued ie loans days past due as defined in bank regulatory agency guidance totaled million at december  and represented of loans outstanding at that date  as compared to approximately million  or of loans at december  these non current loans were composed of approximately million of consumer loans  principally indirect motor vehicle loans  thousand of residential real estate loans and commercial loans of thousand 
the overall level of the company s performing loans which demonstrate characteristics of potential weakness from time to time is for the most part dependent on economic conditions in northeastern new york state 
in general  the economy in the company s geographic market area was relatively strong in the period 
as the country slid into a mild recession in and continued throughout  the economic downturn was not as severe in northeastern new york state 
in the capital district in and around albany and in the area north of the capital district  which are the company s principal service areas  unemployment remained below the national average 
the unemployment rate has been at or above the national average in essex county  near the canadian border  during foreign outstandings none loan concentrations the loan portfolio is well diversified 
there are no concentrations of credit that exceed of the portfolio  other than the general categories reported in the preceding section iia of this report

summary of loan loss experience the company monitors credit quality through a continuous review of the entire loan portfolio 
all significant loans primarily commercial and commercial real estate loans are reviewed at least semi annually  and those under special supervision are reviewed at least quarterly 
additionally  regulatory examiners perform periodic examinations of the company s loan portfolios and report on these examinations to management 
the boards of directors of the company s subsidiary banks  upon recommendations from management  determine the extent of charge offs and have the final decision making responsibility in authorizing charge offs 
through the provision for loan losses  an allowance reserve is maintained for probable loan losses 
actual loan losses are charged against this allowance when they are identified 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers various risk factors influencing asset quality 
the analysis is performed on a loan by loan basis for impaired and large balance loans  and by portfolio type for smaller balance homogeneous loans 
this analysis is based on judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may influence borrowers economic outlook and financial condition and prospects 
in addition to conclusions regarding the adequacy of the allowance  the provision for loan losses is influenced by the total size of the loan portfolio  the level of nonperforming loans  by the level of loans actually charged off against the allowance during prior periods and the change in the mix of loan categories within the loan portfolio 
the table in part ii  item bii 
provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses presents a summary of the activity in the company s allowance for loan losses 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a general allowance applicable to losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
for internal operating purposes  the allowance is not allocated among loan categories 
in the following table  the allowance has been allocated among the loan categories indicated solely for purposes of complying with disclosure requirements of the securities and exchange commission 
however  this allocation should not be interpreted as a projection of i likely sources of future charge offs  ii likely proportional distribution of future charge offs among loan categories or iii likely amounts of future charge offs 
since management regards the allowance as a general balance and has assigned unallocated values to categories in the table solely for purposes of compliance with the disclosure requirements  the amounts presented do not represent the total balance available to absorb future charge offs that might occur within the designated categories 
on a quarterly basis  management risk classifies delinquent or problem loans in the commercial  commercial real estate and real estate construction portfolios as special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
reserves are assigned to all loans by either a specific allocation  a risk classified loss percentage or by a percentage applied to individual categories of loans

in comparing average deposits for the fourth quarters of and  balances increased million  or 
all categories of non maturity deposits increased between the two comparative quarters 
as is typical in falling rate environments  many depositors placed maturing time deposits in non maturity deposits during the third and fourth quarters of and into as well  presumably as a temporary investment until rates start to rise again 
this was also true for the company s municipal depositors who also maintained high balances in now accounts at both year end and the most significant change in deposit mix in was the substantial decrease in time deposits of  or more  both as a percentage of the portfolio and in absolute terms 
the total quarterly average balances as a percentage of total deposits are illustrated in the table below

quarterly cost of deposits quarter ending dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits regular and money market savings time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits including non interest bearing in general  rates paid by the company on its various types of deposit accounts are influenced by the rates being offered or paid by its competitors  which themselves are influenced by prevailing interest rates in the economy as impacted from time to time by the actions of the federal reserve board 
there typically is a time lag between the federal reserve s actions undertaken to influence rates and the actual repricing of deposit liabilities by the company  but the lag is shorter in duration than the lag for loans and other earning assets 
as a result of the eleven rate decreases in by the federal reserve board and an additional decrease in november  the company experienced a decrease in the cost of deposits in each of the quarters in and the cost of deposits during the fourth quarter of was at its lowest point in many years 
if  as many believe  the economy will take several months or longer to recover  the company may continue to experience downward pressures on its net interest spread and net interest margin

liquidity liquidity is measured by the ability of the company to raise cash when it needs it at a reasonable cost 
the company must be capable of meeting expected and unexpected obligations to its customers at any time 
given the uncertain nature of customer demands as well as the need to maximize earnings  the company must have available reasonably priced sources of funds  on and off balance sheet  that can be accessed quickly in time of need 
securities available for sale represent a primary source of balance sheet cash flow 
certain investment securities are selected at purchase as available for sale based on their marketability and collateral value  as well as their yield and maturity 
in addition to liquidity arising from balance sheet cash flows  the company has supplemented liquidity with additional off balance sheet sources such as credit lines with the federal home loan bank fhlb 
the company has established overnight and day term lines of credit with the fhlb each in the amount of million at december  there were no advances under either line at december  if advanced  such lines of credit are collateralized by mortgage backed securities  loans and fhlb stock 
in addition  the company has in place modest borrowing facilities from correspondent banks and also has identified wholesale and retail repurchase agreements and brokered certificates of deposit as appropriate off balance sheet sources of funding 
also  the company s lead bank has established a borrowing facility with the federal reserve bank of new york  pledging certain consumer loans as collateral for potential discount window advances 
at december   the amount available under this facility was million 
there were no advances outstanding at december  the company measures and monitors its basic liquidity as a ratio of liquid assets to short term liabilities  both with and without the availability of borrowing arrangements 
based on the level of cash flows from the company s investment securities portfolio  particularly mortgage backed securities  and from maturing loans in its portfolio  the company s stable core deposit base and its significant borrowing capacity  the company believes that liquidity is sufficient to meet any reasonably likely events or occurrences

capital resources and dividends shareholders equity was million at december   an increase of million  or  from the prior year end 
the increase in shareholders equity during primarily reflected million of retained earnings and an increase of million related to net unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  on securities available for sale  partially offset by million of periodic repurchases of the company s common stock 
in december  the company  through a newly formed subsidiary business trust  privately placed million in capital securities with several institutional investors 
the securities  which are listed as guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in corporation s junior subordinated debentures in the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december   have certain features that make them an alternative funding vehicle and the proceeds qualify as regulatory capital under the capital adequacy guidelines discussed below 
the maintenance of appropriate capital levels is a management priority 
overall capital adequacy is monitored on an ongoing basis by management and reviewed regularly by the board of directors 
the company s principal capital planning goal is to provide an adequate return to shareholders while retaining a sufficient base to provide for future expansion and comply with all regulatory standards 
one set of regulatory capital guidelines applicable to the company and the subsidiary banks are the so called risk based capital measures 
under these measures  as established by federal bank regulators  the minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets is and the minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is 
for the company  tier capital is comprised of shareholders equity and capital securities issued by the company s subsidiary  a statutory business trust see note to the consolidated financial statements less intangible assets 
total capital  for this risk based capital standard  includes tier capital plus other qualifying regulatory capital  including a portion of the company s allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the risk based capital measures  the federal bank regulatory agencies require banks and bank holding companies to satisfy another capital guideline  the tier leverage ratio tier capital to quarterly average assets less intangible assets 
the minimum tier leverage ratio is for the most highly rated institutions 
the guidelines provide that other institutions should maintain a tier leverage ratio that is at least to higher than the minimum level for top rated institutions 
the table below sets forth the capital ratios of the company and its subsidiary banks as of december  capital ratios arrow gfnb snb risk based tier ratio total risk based capital ratio tier leverage ratio at december   the company and both of its subsidiary banks exceeded the minimum capital ratios established by these guidelines  and qualified as well capitalized  the highest category  in the capital classification scheme set by federal bank regulatory agencies see the further discussion under supervision and regulation in part ic of this report 
the principal source of funds for the payment of shareholder dividends by the company has been dividends declared and paid to the company by its bank subsidiaries 
there are various legal and regulatory limitations applicable to the payment of dividends to the company by its subsidiaries as well as the payment of dividends by the company to its shareholders 
as of december   under this statutory limitation  the maximum amount that could have been paid by the bank subsidiaries to the company  without special regulatory approval  was approximately million

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to credit risk in the company s loan portfolio and liquidity risk  discussed earlier  the company s business activities also generate market risk 
market risk is the possibility that changes in future market rates or prices will make the company s position less valuable 
the ongoing monitoring and management of risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process which is governed by policies that are reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out asset liability oversight and control to management s asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability profile based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
the company does not make use of derivatives  such as interest rate swaps  in its risk management process 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the company 
interest rate risk is the exposure of the company s net interest income to changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk is directly related to the different maturities and repricing characteristics of interest bearing assets and liabilities  as well as to prepayment risks for mortgage related assets  early withdrawal of time deposits  and the fact that the speed and magnitude of responses to interest rate changes varies by product 
the alco utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all interest sensitive assets and liabilities reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth and a basis point upward and downward shift in interest rates  where interest bearing assets and liabilities reprice at their earliest possible repricing date 
however  due to the low level of interest rates at december   the downward shift was calculated using a basis point shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed 
applying the simulation model analysis as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates demonstrated a decrease in net interest income  and a basis point decrease in interest rates demonstrated a increase in net interest income 
these amounts were within the company s alco policy limits 
basically  the inverse relationship between changes in prevailing rates and net interest income reflects the fact that the company s liabilities and sources of funds generally reprice more quickly than its earning assets 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
as noted elsewhere in this report  the federal reserve board took certain actions throughout and again at the end of to decrease prevailing short term interest rates  after a month period of increasing interest rates 
management believes it likely that rates will begin to rise later in and in management believes that an extended period of flat interest rates will continue to have a negative impact on net interest margin as asset repricing continues downward while deposit repricing abates  and that an increase in prevailing interest rates will have a short term negative impact on net interest margin and net interest income as well 
management is not able to predict with certainty what the magnitude of these effects would be 
the hypothetical estimates underlying the sensitivity analysis are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  management cannot make any assurance as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate changes on caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  unanticipated shifts in the yield curve and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
