overview vivus is a pharmaceutical company developing innovative products to improve quality of life disorders in men and women  with a focus on sexual dysfunction 
we developed and market in the united states muse alprostadil and actis  two innovations in the treatment of erectile dysfunction  and have entered into a supply agreement with meda ab stockholm medaa 
st for the marketing and distribution of muse in all member states of the european union  the baltic states  the czech republic  hungary  iceland  norway  poland  switzerland and turkey 
in canada  vivus has entered into a license and supply agreement with paladin labs  inc tse plb by which paladin labs markets and distributes muse 
we have ongoing research and development programs in male erectile dysfunction  female sexual dysfunction  and premature ejaculation 
during  vivus experienced a significant decline greater than in market demand for muse as a result of the introduction of viagra in april during the second and third quarters of  we took significant steps to restructure our operations to bring our cost structure in line with current and projected revenues 
as a result  vivus incurred a net loss of million and had negative operating cash flow of approximately million for the year ended december  during  we continued to align our operations more closely with our current and expected revenues 
we achieved profitability for all quarters in  earning per diluted share for the year 
cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities at december  increased million from december  to million  while total liabilities decreased million during the same period 
vivus was awarded five patents in the areas of female sexual dysfunction  erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation to further build and strengthen our patent portfolio 
we established a targeted sales force in the united states to support our product  muse  in the marketplace 
a new drug application was filed for alibra  our second generation product for the treatment of erectile dysfunction  with the united states food and drug administration  which was subsequently withdrawn in october during  we continued to strengthen our balance sheet  increasing working capital by million  to enable investment in our research and development projects and to pursue targeted technology acquisitions to expand our pipeline 
we filed an investigational new drug application and began clinical studies for alista  our product for the treatment of female sexual arousal disorder 
vivus signed an agreement with abbott laboratories for the marketing of muse internationally  except canada  where paladin labs is marketing and distributing muse 
we were awarded several new patents for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and solidified our female sexual dysfunction intellectual property through an agreement with androsolutions 
vivus also received k clearance from the united states food and drug administration in december  for over the counter otc marketing of actis  our adjustable constriction band used to improve erections in men with erectile dysfunction 
significant progress was made in our development programs in our first phase ii clinical study to evaluate the safety of and response to alista was successfully completed and demonstrated a significant increase versus placebo and baseline in sexual response 
we filed an investigational new drug application to initiate a clinical study to evaluate the safety and erectile response to oral ta in men with erectile dysfunction 
a clinical trial was initiated during the fourth quarter of to evaluate the pharmacokinetics blood levels in relation to time with our new oral formulation of vi prescriptions for muse in the united states increased by in the last six months of  as compared to the first six months of we withdrew our european application for alibra 
our development programs continued to advance in an expanded phase ii study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of alista when used by women with female sexual arousal disorder at home with their partner began in the first quarter of and dosing was completed in february we completed a single dose trial to evaluate the safety of and erectile response to oral ta in men with erectile dysfunction 
clinical data from this study demonstrated that ta is capable of restoring penile function in men with erectile dysfunction 
we also began pre clinical development work on a transurethral formulation of ta  alone and in combination with alprostadil  for the treatment of erectile dysfunction 
during the fourth quarter of  we initiated a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vi  a proprietary  oral  on demand treatment for premature ejaculation 
with all these research programs in progress  vivus cash and cash equivalents decreased by million during we signed an international supply agreement with meda ab for the marketing of muse internationally 
united states muse sales units increased over levels 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  doubtful accounts  income taxes  restructuring  inventories and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product returns we record reserves for anticipated returns of expired or damaged product in the united states 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of product returns can be made based on historical experience and our monitoring of inventory levels in the wholesale distribution channel 
revisions in returns estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
there is no right of return on product sold internationally subsequent to shipment  thus no returns reserve is needed 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
for all periods presented  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
we have also recorded income taxes payable for estimated current tax liabilities 
we monitor these estimated liabilities and adjust them as conditions warrant 
restructuring in  we experienced a significant restructuring and recorded restructuring related reserves for severance and employee costs  inventory obsolescence  raw material purchase commitments  property and related commitments  marketing commitments and other commitments 
we monitor the adequacy of these liabilities and have made periodic adjustments as conditions have changed 
inventories we record inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
during the quarter ended september   the company established significant reserves against its inventory to align with new estimates of expected future demand for muse 
the company had built up its inventory level prior to and after the launch of viagra and had not anticipated the impact that viagra would have on the demand for muse 
as of december   the remaining inventory reserve balance is million 
this remaining balance is related to the raw materials inventory that the company previously estimated would not be used 
the company estimates that at least some portion of the fully reserved inventory will now be used in production 
to the extent that this inventory is used in production  it will be charged to cost of goods sold at a zero basis  which will have a favorable impact on gross profit 
contingencies and litigation we are periodically involved in disputes and litigation related to a variety of matters 
when it is probable that we will experience a loss  and that loss is quantifiable  we record appropriate reserves 
we are currently involved in a dispute with our former international distributor  for which arbitration occurred in march the ultimate outcome of this arbitration is not yet known 
results of operations years ended december  and united states product revenue for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million for the year ended december  approximately thousand of the increase to united states revenue was attributable to a price increase vivus implemented at the end of march the remainder of the increase was due to a increase in the number of muse units sold in versus international revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in lower international product revenue in was due to a decrease in product demand by our previous international distributor in anticipation of the transition to our new distribution partner  meda ab 
based on current forecasts from meda ab  we anticipate that international product revenue will increase over levels 
in and  the charge for actual and anticipated returns of product was million and million  respectively 
product return data through the first quarter of indicated an increase to the returns reserve was warranted 
approximately thousand of the returns provision recorded in reflects the required increase to the product returns liability for sales made from january through december the charge for actual and anticipated returns was increased to of united states gross sales as of january cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the same period in the year to date figure includes a reduction in cost of goods sold of thousand as a result of settlements of previously recognized purchase commitment liabilities for our major raw material  alprostadil 
adjusting for this item  comparative gross margins for the twelve months ended december  versus were and  respectively 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  million higher than the same period in the previous year  which included a million payment to tanabe seiyaku for licensing the proprietary compound ta if not for this million expense in  research and development costs in would have been million higher than the same period in due to increased expenditures for clinical development of our current pipeline 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in the year ended december  the increase is due to increased investment in united states sales and marketing efforts and legal expenses relating to the janssen pharmaceutica arbitration hearing that was held in mid march and is discussed on page of this report 
we recorded a tax benefit of thousand for based on an updated estimate of our net tax liabilities as well as filing for a refund of previously paid alternative minimum taxes which became available due to a tax law change 
in  we recorded a tax benefit of million based on an updated estimate of net tax liabilities 
years ended december  and united states product revenue for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million for the year ended december  although total united states revenues declined from year to year due to overall lower demand for muse  prescriptions for muse in the united states increased by in the last six months of  as compared to the first six months of international revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in initial shipments of product to abbott laboratories to support their launch of muse in europe were made in the fourth quarter of in both and  the charge for actual and anticipated returns of product was million  or approximately five percent of united states gross sales 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the same period in in  we determined that a portion of the inventory purchase commitment reserves recorded in was not needed 
accordingly  in  we reversed million of reserves with a corresponding reduction in cost of goods sold 
additionally in  we reversed an accrual for royalties of million related to shipments to our previous international distributors due to the termination of those distribution agreements 
adjusting for these two items  our comparative margins for versus would have been and  respectively 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in the year ended december  the million increase in was primarily due to licensing and development expenses for ta as an oral treatment for male erectile dysfunction  clinical expenses for alista  our product for the treatment of female sexual arousal disorder  and development and clinical expenses for vi to treat premature ejaculation 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in the year ended december  we expanded our targeted united states marketing efforts during  which contributed to this increase 
operating expenses for the year ended december  included a reversal of thousand of restructuring reserve established in related primarily to inventory commitments and other manufacturing expenses that were not required 
we recorded a tax benefit of million for based on an updated estimate of our net tax liabilities 
vivus recorded a tax provision of ten percent of net income before taxes for the effective tax rate calculation for includes the effect of net operating losses  or nols  carried forward from prior periods 
the tax rate would have been substantially higher if the nols had not been available to offset current income 
all deferred tax assets continue to be fully reserved 
liquidity and capital resources unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities totaled million at december   compared with million at december  the decrease during was primarily due to research and development expenditures for development of our current pipeline 
since inception  we have financed operations primarily from the sale of preferred and common stock 
through december   vivus raised million from financing activities and had an accumulated deficit of million at december  total liabilities were million at december   compared with million at december   an increase of thousand 
the increase in total liabilities is related to the timing of our final payment to our previous international distribution partner 
our operating activities used million and million of cash during the years ended december  and  respectively 
in both and  operating expenses  particularly research and development expenses  were higher than revenues from product sales accounting for the use of cash 
net cash provided by investing activities was million during the twelve months ended december  and net cash used for investing activities was million for the same period in the fluctuations from period to period are due primarily to the timing of purchases  sales and maturity of investment securities 
financing activities provided cash of thousand and thousand during the years ended december  and  respectively 
these amounts are primarily the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the sale of stock under our employee stock purchase plan in both and we anticipate that our existing capital resources combined with anticipated future cash flows will be sufficient to support our operating needs throughout the next fifteen to eighteen months 
however  we anticipate that we will be required to obtain additional financing to fund the development of our research and development pipeline in future periods as well as to support the possible launch of any future products 
in particular  other substantial payments will be made in accordance with the agreement for licensing ta these payments are based on certain development  regulatory and sales milestones 
in addition  royalty payments would be required on any future product sales 
we expect to evaluate potential financing sources  including  but not limited to  the issuance of additional equity or debt securities  corporate alliances  joint ventures  and licensing agreements to fund the development and possible commercial launch of any future products 
the sale of additional equity securities would result in additional dilution to vivus stockholders 
our working capital and additional funding requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress of our research and development programs  the timing and results of pre clinical testing and clinical trials  results of operations  demand for muse  technological advances  the level of resources that we devote to our sales and marketing capabilities  and the activities of competitors 
recent accounting pronouncements we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets on january  adoption of these pronouncements did not impact on our net loss 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas no 
to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of stock based employee compensation and revised disclosure requirements  was issued in december we adopted the revised disclosure requirements in the fourth quarter of because we have not elected to expense stock based compensation at fair value  adoption of this pronouncement did not impact on our net loss 
overview of contractual obligations contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating leases    purchases     other long term liabilities   total     the company leases its manufacturing facilities in lakewood  new jersey under a non cancelable operating lease expiring in and has the option to extend this lease for one additional renewal term of five years 
in january  the company entered into a seven year lease for its corporate headquarters in mountain view  california  which expires in january in november  the company entered into a manufacturing agreement to purchase raw materials from a supplier beginning in and ending in the initial commitment is to purchase approximately thousand of product in the first quarter of for testing and regulatory approval 
assuming that the product proves satisfactory  the company will be required to purchase an additional million of product in and a minimum total of million of product from through other long term liabilities relates to the restoration liability for our leased manufacturing facilities 
this liability will remain in effect through the end of the lease term  including any renewals 
the company has exercised its first option to renew the original lease  thereby extending any cash payments to be made relating to this liability out to the second renewal term  if exercised  would then extend the liability out an additional five years  to off balance sheet financing and related party transactions vivus has not entered into any off balance sheet financing arrangements and has not established any special purpose entities 
vivus has not guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities or entered into any options on non financial assets 
the only transaction between vivus and a related party during was mario m 
rosati  one of our directors  who is also a member of wilson sonsini goodrich rosati  professional corporation  which has served as our outside corporate counsel since our formation and has received compensation at normal commercial rates for these services 
dividend policy the company has not paid any dividends since its inception and does not intend to declare or pay any dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future 
declaration or payment of future dividends  if any  will be at the discretion of the company s board of directors after taking into account various factors  including the company s financial condition  operating results and current and anticipated cash needs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the securities and exchange commission s rule related to market risk disclosure requires that we describe and quantify our potential losses from market risk sensitive instruments attributable to reasonably possible market changes 
market risk sensitive instruments include all financial or commodity instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to future changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  commodity prices or other market factors 
vivus is not exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates or commodity prices 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments nor do we hold securities for trading or speculative purposes 
at december  and  we had no debt outstanding  and consequently vivus currently has no risk exposure associated with increasing interest rates 
vivus  however  is exposed to changes in interest rates on our investments in cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
a significant portion of our investments in cash equivalents and available for sale securities are in money market funds that hold short term investment grade commercial paper  treasury bills or other united states government obligations 
currently  this reduces our exposure to long term interest rate changes
