item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  which are included in this report on form k 
overview we market over the counter and prescription pharmaceutical and health related products 
our product lines currently include dermatological brands  marketed by our wholly owned subsidiary  doak dermatologics  inc  and nutritional  respiratory  and internal medicine brands marketed by our kenwood therapeutics division 
we promote products in the dermatology and gastroenterology and  to a lesser extent  nutritional markets 
all of our product lines are manufactured and supplied by independent contractors who operate under our quality control standards 
our products are marketed primarily to wholesalers  which distribute the products to retail outlets and healthcare institutions throughout the united states and selected international markets 
our growth strategy involves acquisitions  including co marketing and licensing agreements  of products from major pharmaceutical organizations that we believe require intensified marketing and promotional attention 
we have acquired  and intend to acquire  rights to manufacture and market pharmaceutical and health related products that studies have shown to be effective and for which a demonstrated market exists  but which are not actively promoted and where the surrounding competitive environment does not necessarily include major pharmaceutical companies 
in addition to acquisitions  our growth strategy involves our introduction of new products through modest research and development of existing chemical entities

the overall increases in the dermatology products  and in particular carmol cream  carmol lotion and acidmantle lidamantle line products  were primarily due to greater promotional attention and the utilization of market research data to ensure product messages are received by the most potentially productive audiences 
due to the offering of slight discount and extended payment terms to wholesalers and increased demand for our products  we shipped during december   to a major customer 
the sales decline in pamine was primarily due to the realignment of the field force and promotional efforts towards greater growth opportunities in the area of dermatology

due to the offering of slight discounts to wholesalers and increased demand for our products  we shipped during december   of products to a major customer 
the sales decline of deconamine and brontex was primarily attributable to an increase in therapeutic generic substitution  formulary restrictions  reduction in promotion  and the launch of new competitive products 
cost of sales for was  representing a decrease from of  our gross profit percentage for was as compared to during the improvement in the gross profit margin reflects a change in our sales mix with greater sales of prescription products that historically carry a higher gross profit percentage 
the change in the sales mix represented an increase in prescription products of carmol  pamine and lidamantle

interest income  net for was  representing an improvement of  from s interest expense of  the improvement was principally due to a decrease in borrowings from the revolving asset based credit facility  decrease in the acquisition note and an increase in interest income from short term investments due to the company s investing excess cash 
loss due to impairment of asset for was  we recorded an impairment loss relating to the deconamine trademark 
as a result of our strategic review process of our product lines and related intangible assets  we determined that an event or circumstance occurred 
we changed our future sales forecast for the product during april after it became apparent that significant marketing attention during the fourth quarter had minimal impact on the product s sales 
consequently  the fair value of the deconamine trademark was calculated on the basis of discounted estimated future cash flows and resulted in a non cash charge of  this charge  which has been recorded in the consolidated statement of income  had no impact on the company s cash flow 
no impairment loss was recorded for loss on investment for was  we recorded a  pre tax charge related to an impairment of an investment resulting from a subsequent bank failure 
a portion of our million certificate of deposit invested is unlikely to be collected 
the revised carrying amount of  is comprised of i  representing the amount we already collected on the certificate of deposit and ii  representing the estimated amount realizable on the certificate of deposit based upon information we obtained from the fdic 
no investment loss was recorded for income tax expense for was  in comparison to an income tax benefit of  for or an increase in income tax expense of  the increase was principally due an increase in pre tax income in fiscal during fiscal and  we benefited from a reduction of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of  net income for was  as compared to a net loss of  in  representing an increase of  the increase was principally due an increase in net sales  an increase in gross profit percentage  an increase in interest revenue and a recording of a loss due to impairment of asset of  in  which was partially offset by an increase selling  general  and administrative expenses  an increase in depreciation and amortization and the recording of a loss on investment

net income for doak dermatologics for was  representing an increase of  from the increase was principally due to an increase in net sales of  and an increase in the gross profit percentage from to 
the same product sales of carmol and lidamantle and new product sales of lidamantle hc and carmol lotion primarily contributed to the increase in net sales and gross profit percentage 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements arise from working capital requirements  debt service and funding of acquisitions 
we have historically met these cash requirements through cash from operations  proceeds from our line of credit  bank borrowings for product acquisitions and the issuance of common stock 
our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were  and  at december  and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities for was  the sources of cash primarily resulted from net income of  plus non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of  a decrease in deferred income taxes of  noncash compensation for consulting services of  tax benefit for exercise of non qualified stock options and warrants of  an increase in accrued expenses of  primarily due to an increase in the rebate liability  and a decrease in accounts receivable of  resulting from increased collections 
the sources of cash were partially offset by an increase in inventories of  an increase in prepaid expenses and other of  a decrease in accounts payable of  primarily due to an increase in cash payments to vendors  a decrease in income taxes payable of  due to increase in cash payments for taxes 
cash provided by investing activities for was  which was primarily the result of proceeds from the sale of short term investments of  partially offset by purchases of short term investments of  and property and equipment of  cash used in financing activities for was  the financing activities for consisted primarily of a payment of long term debt of  proceeds from exercise of stock options and warrants of  payment of financing costs of  for the new asset based credit facility and acquisition facility with wachovia bank  payment of registration costs of  purchases of treasury stock of  and distributions of treasury stock of  to fund the k plan contributions 
on november   the company entered into a loan agreement with wachovia bank with respect to a million revolving asset based credit facility and a million acquisition facility for future product acquisitions 
advances under the revolving asset based credit facility are calculated pursuant to a formula  which is based upon the company s eligible accounts receivable and inventory levels 
advances under the million acquisition facility are pursuant to the company finding a potential acquisition  satisfying financial covenants and  depending upon the potential size of an acquisition  wachovia s final approval 
this loan agreement has an initial term of two years 
interest accrues on amounts outstanding at a rate equal to libor plus and the commitment fee accrues on the unused portion of the asset based credit facility and the acquisition facility at a rate equal to 
per annum 
the company s obligations under this loan agreement have been collateralized by the company s grant to wachovia of a lien upon substantially all the company s assets 
this loan agreement with wachovia bank replaces the previous loan agreement with lasalle business credit  inc  which expired on november  the principal differences between the new loan agreement with wachovia and previous agreement with lasalle is an increase in the revolving asset based credit facility of million  an increase in the acquisition note of million and lower interest rates 
as of the date of this report  the company has not borrowed any funds from the revolving asset based credit facility or the acquisition facility 
as of the date of this report  we had the following contractual obligations and commitments year ending december  operating leases capital leases a other debt thereafter a lease amounts include interest and minimum lease payments we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be adequate to fund our current working capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  in the event that we make or anticipate significant acquisitions in the future  we may be required to raise additional funds through additional borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
critical accounting estimates in preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses for the reporting period covered thereby 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates used in the preparation of financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates discussed below with the audit committee and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosures relating to these estimates 
revenue recognition 
revenue from product sales  net of estimated provisions  is recognized when the merchandise is shipped to an unrelated third party pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products has occurred  iii the selling price is both fixed and determinable and  iv collectibility is reasonably probable 
our customers consist primarily of large pharmaceutical wholesalers who sell directly into the retail channel 
provisions for sales discounts  and estimates for chargebacks  rebates  damaged product returns and exchanges for expired product  are established as a reduction of product sales revenues at the time such revenues are recognized  based on historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
these revenue reductions are generally reflected either as a direct reduction to accounts receivable through an allowance  or as an addition to accrued expenses if the payment is due to a party other than the wholesale or retail customer 
we do not provide any forms of price protection to our wholesale customers and we typically permit product returns only if the product is damaged or if it is returned within six to months of expiration and months after expiration 
chargebacks and rebates are based on the difference between the prices at which we sell our products to wholesalers and the sales price ultimately paid by the end user often governmental agencies and managed care buying groups pursuant to fixed price contracts 
we record an estimate of the amount either to be charged back to us  or rebated to the end user  at the time of sale to the wholesaler 
we have recorded reserves for chargebacks  returns and rebates based upon various factors  including current contract prices  historical trends and future expectations 
the amount of actual chargebacks  returns and rebates claimed could differ either higher or lower from the amounts we accrued 
changes in estimate would be recorded in the income statement in the period of the change 
intangible assets and goodwill 
we have made acquisitions of products and businesses that include goodwill  license agreements  product rights and other identifiable intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles including goodwill prior to january  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following  i significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  ii significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and iii significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we first perform an assessment of the asset s recoverability based on expected undiscounted future net cash flow  and if the amount is less than the asset s value  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
as of january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which eliminated the amortization of purchased goodwill  resulting in an increase in pretax income of approximately  for the fiscal year ended december  adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we performed an impairment test of our goodwill amounting to  at january  and determined that no impairment of the recorded goodwill existed 
the fair value of the reporting unit was calculated on the basis of discounted estimated future cash flows and compared to the related book value of such reporting units 
under sfas no 
 goodwill will be tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently if an event occurs which indicates the goodwill may be impaired 
the company performed the test at december   and noted that no impairment existed 
as of january   we also adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no effect on our financial statements 
deferred income taxes are provided for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax base 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in our opinion  it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of december   we determined that no deferred tax asset valuation allowance was necessary and eliminated previously established valuation allowance 
we believe that our projections of future taxable income makes it more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized 
if our projections of future taxable income changes in the future  we may be required to reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance 
impact of inflation we have experienced only moderate price increases under our agreements with third party manufactures as a result of raw material and labor price increases 
we have passed these price increases along to our customers 
however  there can be no assurance that possible future inflation would not impact our operations 
seasonality sales of certain non focused products  such as cough and cold products  increase between october and march due to the cold and flu season 
we expect the impact of seasonality to decrease as we acquire or obtain licenses for products that treat chronic conditions 
however  we anticipate that the seasonality may continue to affect sales for the foreseeable future 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
rescinds the requirement that all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt be classified as an extraordinary item 
additionally  sfas no 
requires that certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
sfas no 
is effective for the company beginning in  and the effect of adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit and disposal activities 
this statement revises the accounting for exit and disposal activities under emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
specifically  sfas requires that companies record the costs to exit an activity or dispose of long lived assets when those costs are incurred 
sfas requires that the measurement of the liability be at fair value 
the provisions of sfas are effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  and will impact any exit or disposal activities initiated after such date 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that changes to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure provisions of sfas to require expanded and more prominent disclosures in annual financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the proforma effect on reported results of applying the fair value method for entities that use the intrinsic value method 
the proforma disclosures are also required to be displayed prominently in interim financial statements 
the company does not intend to change to the fair value method of accounting and has included the disclosure requirements of sfas in the accompanying financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
fin is effective on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   but has certain disclosure requirements effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we have historically not issued guarantees and we do not anticipate adoption disclosure requirements of fin to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  for certain entities that do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest variable interest entities 
variable interest entities within the scope of fin will be required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is determined to be the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected returns  or both 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  the company is in the process of determining what impact  if any  the adoption of the provisions of fin will have upon its financial condition or results of operations 
certain transitional disclosures required by fin in all financial statements initially issued after january   have been included in the accompanying financial statements 
in november  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus opinion on eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the consensus provides that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met 
the consideration for the arrangement should be allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  with different provisions if the fair value of all deliverables are not known or if the fair value is contingent on delivery of specified items or performance conditions 
applicable revenue recognition criteria should be considered separately for each separate unit of accounting 
eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  entities may elect to report the change as a cumulative effect adjustment in accordance with apb opinion  accounting changes 
the company has not determined the effect of adoption of eitf on its financial statements or the method of adoption it will use 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operating results and cash flows are subject to fluctuations from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
our purchases of entsol spray are made in euros 
we expect to make purchases several times per year 
while the effect of foreign currency translations has not been material to our results of operations to date  currency translations on import purchases could be adversely affected in the future by the relationship of the us dollar to foreign currencies 
in addition  foreign currency fluctuations can have an adverse effect upon exports  even though we recognize sales to international distributors in us dollars 
foreign currency fluctuations can directly affect the marketability of our products in international markets 
to the extent that we borrow under our credit facility with wachovia bank  we will experience market risk with respect to changes in the applicable interest rates and its effect upon our interest expense 
because such rates are variable  an increase in interest rates will result in additional interest expense and a reduction in interest rates will result in reduced interest expense 
as of the date of this report  we had the following outstanding debt with fixed rate interest and no outstanding debt with variable interest rates 
year ending december  debt a average fixed rate interest n a thereafter n a a debt amounts include interest and minimum debt payments we are also exposed to interest rate fluctuations on our short term investments that are comprised of us government treasury notes  which we hold on an available for sale basis 
we have not entered into derivative financial instruments 
stock prices of emerging growth pharmaceutical and micro cap companies such as ours fluctuate significantly 
in particular  our stock price during the year has fluctuated from a low of to a high of a variety of factors that could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially  include announcements of developments related to our business  quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results  general conditions in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries  new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation  and developments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers 
we will not be able to control many of these factors  and we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results will not necessarily be indicative of our future performance 
if our revenues  if any  in any particular period do not meet expectations  we may not be able to adjust our expenditures in that period  which could cause our operating results to suffer further 
if our operating results in any future period fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price may fall by a significant amount 
in addition  in recent years there have been extreme fluctuations in the stock market in general and the market for shares for small capitalization and emerging growth pharmaceutical companies in particular 
these fluctuations were sometimes unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies  such as general market conditions and world events 
any such fluctuations in the future could reduce the market price of our common stock 
we do not know whether the market price of our common stock will decline or not
