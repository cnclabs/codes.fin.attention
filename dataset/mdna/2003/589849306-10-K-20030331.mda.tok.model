net income the company s software licensing business is not currently profitable because it is not generating sufficient revenue to cover selling  general and administrative expenses and other costs required to operate the business 
the company believes that  in order to compete effectively in software licensing distribution  it must maintain high service levels  specialized sales and marketing infrastructure  specific software licensing management expertise  and state of the art information technology capabilities that entail fixed costs that cannot be further reduced significantly 
the company believes that it will be able to achieve revenue levels that will allow its software licensing business to be profitable within the next several quarters  provided that the company continues to be successful in adding new vendors and is able to maintain the growth rates it has achieved over the last year 
there is no assurance that the company will be successful in doing so 
the company reported net income available to common stockholders of  or per share  in compared to net income available to common stockholders of  or per share  in comparison of fiscal years ended december  and december  net sales the company s net sales decreased from  in to  for the year ended december  net sales include  and  generated by the canadian distribution business for the years ended and  respectively

in the year ended december   gross profit reflects a reduction of costs of sales of  primarily as a result of favorable vendor settlements 
excluding such charges and reduction  gross margin would have been in compared to in this increase is primarily related to the fact that the canadian distribution business has historically experienced higher margins than the us distribution business

net income loss the company reported a net loss available to common stockholders of  or loss per share  in compared to net income available to common stockholders of  or per share  in variability of quarterly results and seasonality historically  the industry in which the company operates has experienced variability in its net sales and operating margins on a quarterly basis and expects these patterns to continue in the future with respect to its us software licensing business 
management believes that the factors influencing quarterly variability include i the overall growth in the computer industry  ii shifts in short term demand for the company s products resulting  in part  from the introduction of new products or updates to existing products  iii intensity of price competition among the company and its competitors as influenced by various factors  and iv the fact that virtually all sales in a given quarter result from orders booked in that quarter 
due to the factors noted above  as well as the dynamic qualities of the computer products distribution industry  the company s revenues and earnings may be subject to material volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis  and the results for any quarterly period may not be indicative of results for a full fiscal year 
additionally  the company s net sales in the fourth quarter have been historically higher than in its other three quarters 
management believes that the pattern of higher fourth quarter sales is partially explained by customer buying patterns relating to calendar year end business 
as a result of this pattern  the company s working capital requirements in the fourth quarter have typically been greater than other quarters

net cash provided by investing activities in consisted primarily of proceeds of  from the sale of moca and  from the sale of merisel canada 
net cash provided by financing activities in was  and included revolver borrowings of  associated with new credit facility entered into by merisel canada upon the expiration of a receivables purchase agreement see notes to consolidated financial statements note sale of accounts receivable 
cash used in financing activities was  for the purchase of the remainder of the notes 
cash flows activity for the year ended december  net cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was  the primary use of cash is a decrease in accounts payable of  and the net loss for the year  excluding the non cash charges for depreciation and bad debt provisions 
the accounts payable decrease was primarily the result of the termination of vendor relationships of the us distribution business 
the decrease was offset by declines in inventory of  and in accounts receivable of  both of which were also primarily related to the wind down of the us distribution business excluding software licensing 
net cash provided by investing activities in was  and related to cash proceeds of  from the sale of the company s el segundo building in september  cash proceeds of  from the sale of the marlborough  massachusetts call center in january and cash proceeds of  from the sale of moca in october net cash used for financing activities in was  and consisted primarily of  used to purchase  aggregate principal of the notes  which was offset by  of proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred

in june  an affiliate of stonington partners  inc  which owns approximately of the company s outstanding common stock  purchased  shares of convertible preferred issued by the company for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the convertible preferred provides for an annual dividend payable in additional shares of convertible preferred 
dividends are cumulative and will accrue from the original issue date whether or not declared by the board of directors 
cumulative accrued dividends of  and  were recorded at december  and  respectively 
the company leases certain of its facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating leases 
future minimum rental payments under leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year are  in and  in the company has historically obtained a large portion of its working capital financing under receivables securitization facilities and  to a lesser extent  revolving credit facilities 
with the sale of the moca business and merisel canada and the wind down of the us distribution business excluding software licensing  the company no longer has any of these financing facilities 
because the software licensing business requires the maintenance of minimal levels of inventory  the working capital requirements are much less than the company s historical needs for its distribution business and it is able to meet its working capital needs without the need for any financing facility  in large part because of its substantial cash balances 
as revenues of the software licensing business grow  the company may seek to establish a working capital financing facility to provide additional funding for that business and for acquisitions 
the company has obligations relating to the wind down of its us distribution business in addition to working capital requirements related to its software licensing business 
the company expects that expenditures related to the wind down will consume some amount of the company s cash balance at december  the company is involved in certain legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business  none of which is expected to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of merisel 
the company made estimates of its potential exposures and has established reserves for potential losses related to such proceedings 
there can be no assurance that the company s reserves will fully cover any possible exposure 
in addition  over the last several years the company has disposed of a number of businesses  including all of its operations outside the united states  many of which had obligations that had been guaranteed by the company 
in connection with those dispositions  the company sought either to have any guarantees released or to be indemnified against any liabilities under guarantees 
the company may not have identified all guarantees to be released and  in at least one instance  the indemnification provided to the company is no longer of any value 
due to the nature of these indemnifications  the company s exposure under the agreements cannot be estimated and no amounts have been recorded for such indemnities 
management believes that  with its cash balances and anticipated cash balances after wind down related expenditures  which balances are substantial in relation to the company s working capital needs  as well as expected revenues and cash flow from operations  it has sufficient liquidity for the foreseeable future 
if the company were to use a significant amount of cash to fund one or more acquisitions  the company could have less liquidity to meet its working capital needs 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from the company s estimates 
such differences could be material to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes the application of its accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in
