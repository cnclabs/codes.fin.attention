item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
since the industry downturn began in mid  we have closed or consolidated manufacturing facilities  including one closed in march  and since mid we have closed retail sales locations as we have been eliminating under performing operations and rationalizing our operations and capacity for industry conditions 
the industry s us manufacturing shipments and retail sales of new homes in could continue to suffer from the factors described above 
acquisitions and expansions from to  we significantly expanded our manufactured housing production operations through acquisitions  internal growth and  in  our merger with redman industries  inc redman  a publicly held company 
as a result of this growth  champion s manufacturing revenues increased from less than million in excluding redman sales to over billion in during and  we significantly expanded our retail operations by completing the acquisitions of retail organizations 
from to  we acquired eight manufactured housing companies that operated manufactured housing facilities at the time of acquisition 
among the companies acquired were dutch housing  inc in michigan and indiana  chandeleur homes  inc and homes of legend  inc 
in alabama  and homes of merit  inc in florida 
in addition  from through the company opened new production facilities 
in and  we acquired retail organizations which operated sales centers 
among those acquired were southern showcase housing  inc headquartered in north carolina  advantage homes  inc in california  iseman homes  inc headquartered in south dakota  a homes in texas  and trading post mobile homes  inc in kentucky 
in  we formed champion development corp 
cdc to make minority interest investments in manufactured housing developments 
cdc formed sunchamp llc  a joint venture with sun communities  inc  a publicly held real estate investment trust 
cdc also invested in other communities and related businesses 
as of december  cdc had investments in developments in seven states 
during  sun communities acquired our interest in sunchamp llc  we closed our communities management and development administrative offices and we divested of certain other development operations 
in january  we sold another of our development companies 
our remaining development operations are not significant to the operations of the company 

table of contents in  we formed genesis homes genesis as a new division to build and sell homes directly to small and medium sized builders and developers 
genesis currently produces modular and manufactured homes in homebuilding facilities  which provides a nationwide market presence 
our genesis plants sold approximately  homes through local builders and developers in which accounted for of homes sold by our manufacturing operations 
genesis plants also currently produce traditional manufactured homes which are sold to independent and company owned retailers 
in  we acquired the manufactured housing consumer loan origination business of cit group sales financing  inc cit 
through this business  which we operate as homepride finance corp 
hpfc  we are able to fund loans to consumers who purchase champion manufactured homes from both company owned and independent retailers 
segment information financial information about the company s manufacturing  retail and financial services segments is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our foreign operations consist of two manufacturing facilities in western canada 
during each of the last three years these canadian operations accounted for less than of our consolidated total sales and total assets 
products most of the homes that we produce are constructed to building standards in accordance with the national manufactured home construction and safety standards promulgated by the us department of housing and urban development hud code homes 
approximately of the homes we produced in were hud code homes compared to in the remaining homes we produced were modular homes in and in or were manufactured in canada in and in 
modular homes are designed and built to meet local building codes 
homes produced and sold in canada are constructed in accordance with applicable canadian building standards 
champion produces a broad range of multi section and single section homes under various trade names and brand names and in a variety of floor plans and price ranges 
most of the homes we build are single story  ranch style homes  but we also build one and one half story and two story homes  cape cod style homes and multi family units such as townhomes 
the homes that we manufacture generally range in size from to  square feet and typically include two to four bedrooms  a living room or family room  dining room  kitchen and two full bathrooms 
during the past ten years  the portion of our sales comprised of larger homes has been increasing 
in  we produced and sold  homes  of which were multi section compared to in and in during  our average home price for manufacturing shipments was  excluding delivery  and manufacturing sales prices ranged from  to over  retail sales prices of the homes  without land  generally range from  to over  depending upon size  floor plan  features and options 
during  the average new home retail selling price for homes sold to consumers by company owned retail sales centers was  including delivery  setup and retailer supplied accessories 
the chief components and products used in manufactured housing are generally of the same quality as those used by other housing builders  including conventional site builders 
these components include lumber  plywood  chipboard  drywall  steel  vinyl floor coverings  insulation  exterior siding wood  vinyl and metal  windows  shingles  kitchen appliances  furnaces  plumbing and electrical fixtures and hardware 
these components are presently available from several sources and the company is not dependent upon any particular supplier 
prices of certain materials such as lumber  insulation  and drywall can fluctuate significantly due to changes in demand and supply 
the industry and the company generally have been able to pass higher material costs on to the consumer in the form of surcharges and base price increases 
it is not certain  however  that any future price increases can be passed on to the consumer without affecting demand 
most completed homes have carpeting  cabinets  appliances  wall coverings  window treatments  and electrical  heating and plumbing systems 
optional factory installed features include fireplaces and skylights 

table of contents upon completion and factory sale of the home  it is transported directly to the consumer s home site or to a retail sales center 
in connection with the retail sale of the home to the consumer  the home is transported to the home site  placed on a foundation and readied by setup contractors for occupancy 
the sections of a multi section home are joined and the interior and exterior seams are finished at the home site 
the consumer purchase of the home may also include retailer or contractor supplied items such as additional appliances  air conditioning  furniture  a porch or deck and a garage 
production our homes are constructed in indoor facilities using an assembly line process employing approximately to production employees at each facility 
most of the homes are constructed in one or more sections also known as floors on a permanently affixed steel support chassis 
each section or floor is assembled in stages beginning with the construction of the chassis  then adding other constructed and purchased components  and ending with a final quality control inspection 
the sections of some of the modular homes that we produce are built and transported on carriers  rather than on a steel chassis 
the efficiency of the assembly line process  protection from the weather  and favorable pricing of materials resulting from our substantial purchasing power  enables the company to produce homes in less than one week at substantially less cost than conventional site built housing 
according to data reported by the us department of commerce  manufactured housing costs approximately per square foot  compared to per square foot for site built housing  excluding the cost of land 
the production schedules of our manufacturing facilities are based upon wholesale buyer retailer and builder developer orders which fluctuate from week to week 
orders from retailers are generally subject to cancellation at any time without penalty and are not necessarily an indication of future business 
retailers place orders for retail stocking inventory purposes and for customer purchase orders 
before scheduling homes for production  orders and availability of financing are confirmed with the retailer and where applicable  the floor plan lender 
orders are generally filled within days of receipt  depending upon the level of unfilled orders and requested delivery dates 
as of the end of december  unfilled orders for wholesale housing totaled an estimated million  compared to million a year earlier 
although manufactured homes can be produced throughout the year in indoor facilities  demand for homes is usually affected by inclement weather and by the cold winter months in northern areas of the us and in canada 
we produce homes to fill existing wholesale and retail orders and  therefore  generally our assembly plants do not carry finished goods inventories except for homes awaiting delivery 
typically  a one to three weeks supply of raw materials is maintained 
charges to transport homes increase with the distance from the factory to the retailer or home site 
as a result  most of the retail stores we sell to are located within a mile radius of champion s assembly plants 
independent retailers during  approximately of our manufacturing shipments were to approximately  independent retail locations throughout the us and western canada 
of these independents  were part of the champion home center chc retailer program as of december  independent chc retailers purchased approximately of the homes we produced in  or approximately of the homes we sold to independent retailers 
chc retailers have access to a broad range of products  including modular homes  and to a variety of training programs for sales techniques  management tools  inventory management and retail customer financing procedures 
they also benefit from marketing and advertising support  lead management tools  internet applications and support  a salesperson retention program  and national promotional campaigns 
chc retailers have committed to stocking a minimum of of their inventories with champion produced homes and to displaying signage identifying their location as a chc 
we continually seek to increase our manufacturing shipments by growing sales at our existing independent retailers and by finding new independent retailers to sell our homes 

table of contents as is common in the industry  our independent retailers may sell manufactured homes produced by other manufacturers in addition to those produced by the company 
some independent retailers operate multiple sales centers 
in  no single independent retailer or distributor accounted for more than of our manufacturing sales 
the majority of independent retailer home purchases are financed by lending institutions subject to a floor plan agreement and secured by a lien on such homes 
a manufacturing facility generally receives payment from the lending institution to days after a home is sold to an independent retailer 
in accordance with trade practice  the company enters into various repurchase agreements with the lending institutions providing floor plan financing  as is more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and in contingent repurchase obligations in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
company owned retail sales centers our retail sales in totaled million  down from million in purchases by company owned retailers accounted for of home shipments made by our manufacturing operations in of the total new homes sold by company owned retailers in  were champion produced compared to in each of our company owned retailers does business autonomously under its own name and carries and sells homes based on availability from suppliers and marketability for their local area 
company owned sales centers are members of our chc network 
we had retail locations in states as of december   consisting of full service sales centers and sales offices in manufactured housing communities 
as of december   we operated retail locations in states  consisting of full service sales centers and sales offices in communities 
each of our full service retail sales centers has a sales office  which is generally a factory built home  and a variety of model homes of various sizes  floor plans  features and prices 
customers may purchase a home from an inventory of homes maintained at the location  including a model home  or may order a home that will be built at a manufacturing facility 
many sales centers also sell pre owned homes that are obtained through trade ins or repossessed homes purchased from or sold on a consignment basis for consumer finance companies 
at december   company owned sales centers had an average inventory of new homes per location  including homes delivered to a consumer home site but not yet recorded as a sale 
historically  company owned retailers generally financed their inventories of homes under floor plan financing arrangements similar to those discussed above under independent retailers 
however  in  we repaid a substantial portion of the outstanding floor plan financing balances 
our full service  company owned sales centers are generally located on a main road or highway for high visibility 
model homes may be displayed in a residential setting with sidewalks and landscaping 
each sales center usually employs a manager and three or four commissioned salespersons 
most retail customers finance the purchase of their home through a lending institution 
the sales center often assists in arranging financing and insurance on the home  for which a fee may be received 
the majority of consumer purchases of manufactured homes now involve land  therefore retailers often assist the home buyer with the land component of the purchase transaction 
the sales centers may also sell additional accessories in connection with the sale of the home  such as central air conditioning  decks  skirting and additional appliances 
retailers also often arrange for necessary permits and utility connections 
market factory built housing competes with other forms of new low cost housing such as site built housing  panelized homes and condominiums  and with existing housing such as pre owned homes and apartments 
according to statistics published by ncsbcs and the united states department of commerce  bureau of the census  for the past five years and for  manufactured housing shipments of hud code homes accounted for an estimated and  respectively  of all new single family housing starts and and  respectively  of all new single family homes sold 
industry wholesale shipments of hud code homes totaled approximately  homes in  down from levels and down from levels  according to data reported by ncsbcs 
based on data reported by statistical surveys  inc  we estimate that 
table of contents industry retail new home sales in totaled  homes  down from levels 
in addition  we estimate that about  modular homes were built and sold in the us in the market for manufactured housing is affected by a number of different factors  including availability of consumer financing  underwriting standards and cost of consumer financing  consumer confidence  job creation  general economic conditions and the overall affordability of manufactured housing versus other forms of housing 
in addition  demographic trends  such as changes in population growth  and competition affect the demand for housing products 
interest rates and the availability of financing influence the affordability of manufactured housing 
there can be no assurance that a rise in overall interest rates would not have an adverse impact on the general economy and  therefore  the market for manufactured housing 
we believe the segment of the housing market in which manufactured housing is most competitive includes consumers with household incomes under  this segment has a high representation of young single persons and married couples  as well as elderly or retired persons 
the comparatively low cost of fully or partially furnished housing attracts these consumers 
persons in rural areas  where fewer housing alternatives exist  and those who presently live in manufactured homes make up a significant portion of the demand for new manufactured housing 
we believe that a much larger market may exist  including apartment dwellers and persons who have traditionally purchased lower priced site built homes 
our operations target this market 
in the past  a number of factors have restricted demand for manufactured housing  including less favorable financing terms for manufactured housing compared to site built housing  the effects of restrictive zoning on the availability of certain locations for home placement and  in some cases  an unfavorable public image 
certain of these negative factors have lessened considerably in recent years with the improved quality and appearance of manufactured housing 
consumer financing the number of manufactured homes that are sold to consumers and related wholesale demand are significantly affected by the availability  credit underwriting standards  terms and cost of consumer financing 
two basic types of consumer financing are available home only or personal property loans for purchasers of only the home  and real estate mortgages for purchasers of the home and land on which the home is placed 
loose credit standards for home only loans in the mid to late s led to the recent high number of industry repossessions of homes from consumers 
during the past three years  a number of home only lenders have exited the market 
conseco finance corp 
conseco has historically been one of the largest home only finance companies in the manufactured housing industry 
in october  conseco discontinued providing home only financing for the industry and in december filed a petition for bankruptcy 
the conseco situation has affected the asset backed securitization market  which has been a significant source of long term capital for originators of manufactured housing home only loans 
as a result  remaining lenders have tightened their credit standards and terms and increased interest rates which has reduced lending volumes 
based on a survey published by manufactured housing institute mhi  total new manufactured home retail sales financed with home only loans have declined to less than of industry sales in in  we estimated approximately of new manufactured home retail sales were financed with home only loans 
since the late s the number of manufactured home sales financed with real estate mortgages has been growing 
we estimate that the percentage of total new manufactured home retail sales financed with real estate mortgages has increased from approximately in to approximately in the levels of lending availability for both personal property loans and real estate mortgages significantly affect the number of manufactured homes that can be sold to consumers and related wholesale demand 
company owned consumer finance business we operate the manufactured housing consumer loan origination business that we acquired in april from cit as hpfc 
the cit loan origination platform has technologically advanced systems  with nearly of loan applications received through the internet 
we have entered into agreements whereby  for a 
table of contents period of three years  an affiliate of cit is providing its loan origination and servicing systems to us and is servicing the loans we originate 
hpfc operates a disciplined loan origination business primarily for consumers who purchase new champion manufactured homes from company owned or independent retailers and some high quality pre owned manufactured homes 
independent retailers are subjected to a rigorous approval process before consumer loan applications are accepted from them 
we continually evaluate our retailers performance by monitoring the portfolio of loans originated by them by considering  among other things  loan delinquencies  repossession rates and related loss experience 
we adhere to rigorous loan origination and credit underwriting policies 
we require company owned and independent retailers to pre screen potential loan applicants prior to submission of loan applications to hpfc 
all loans with credit exceptions are reviewed by a higher level of hpfc management 
we use credit bureau scores provided by at least one of the three major credit reporting agencies to help assess credit risk and determine pricing 
additionally  each application is evaluated for borrower stability time at current residence and employment  collateral value  willingness to repay and ability to pay income  down payment and debt ratio 
we require a down payment in the form of cash  the trade in value of a previously owned manufactured home  and or the fair market value of equity in real property pledged as additional collateral 
the balance of the purchase price is financed by hpfc using installment sales contracts or mortgage instruments providing for a purchase money security interest in the manufactured home and a mortgage on any real property pledged as additional collateral 
generally  the loan contracts provide for equal monthly payments over a term of seven to years at fixed rates of interest 
the hpfc quality control department reviews all underwriting  credit and other related documentation for accuracy  completeness and consistency of information  with a focus on underwriting decisions  welcome and audit calls  credit approval propriety and compliance with federal and state regulations 
additionally  closing documents are reviewed and income is verified prior to funding any loan 
we used a portion of the proceeds of the april issuance of million of senior notes due  together with cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of manufactured home loans and contracts in connection with our warehouse facility  to provide working capital for our consumer finance business 
we expect long term financing to be provided by asset backed securitization transactions in the capital markets 
alternatively  we may also seek to sell some or all of the loans funded by the warehouse facility from time to time through privately negotiated whole loan sale transactions 
hpfc  through a wholly owned subsidiary  has a interest in an affiliated business arrangement called homepride mortgage  lp hpm  which originates  brokers and places or sells residential real estate mortgage loans for company owned retailers and independent retailers of champion products 
the majority owner of hpm administers the business  funds the loans and sells the loans to its affiliate  a mortgage bank 
wholesale financing independent retailers of manufactured homes generally finance their inventory purchases from the manufacturers with floor plan financing that is provided by third party lending institutions 
the availability and cost of floor plan financing can affect the amount of retailer inventory of new homes  the number of retail sales centers and related wholesale demand 
during the past five years  several national floor plan lenders have exited the industry or curtailed their lending volumes  while a smaller number of national lenders  and a large number of local and regional banks  have entered the market or increased lending volumes 
we estimate that currently of total floor plan financing for our independent retailers is with local and regional banks 
competition the manufactured housing industry is highly competitive at both the manufacturing and retail levels  with competition based upon several factors  including price  product features  reputation for service and quality  merchandising and the terms of retailer promotional programs  and retail customer financing 
capital requirements for entry into the manufactured housing industry are relatively low 

table of contents according to ncsbcs  in december there were approximately producers of manufactured homes in the us we estimate that these producers were operating approximately production facilities 
this total compares to approximately plants in in  the top five companies had combined market share of approximately of hud code homes  according to data from a survey by mhm 
based on industry data reported by ncsbcs  in the company s us wholesale market share of hud code homes sold was  compared to in this decline in wholesale market share was due primarily to our restructuring actions  which have eliminated our under performing operations and rationalized our operations and capacity for industry conditions 
we believe there are an estimated  industry retail locations throughout the us we sell our homes through company owned sales centers and approximately  independent retailers  which at december  included independent locations that are members of our chc retail distribution network 
in  we also sold homes directly to approximately builders and developers  primarily from our genesis operations 
builders and developers an increasing portion of the homes we build are being sold directly through builders and developers to a consumer segment which differs from consumers who purchase homes through our traditional retail distribution channel 
in  we sold approximately  homes of the total homes we produced directly to builders and developers through our genesis homes manufacturing facilities 
in addition  certain of our other homebuilding plants also sell homes directly to builders developers 
the selling process to builders developers is different than that of our traditional distribution channel 
we attract builder and developer inquiries through direct solicitation  trade shows  direct advertising  the internet and by word of mouth 
the builder developer acquires the land  obtains the appropriate zoning  develops the land and usually builds the foundation for the homes 
we design  engineer  build and deliver the homes to the sites 
we  or the builder developer  contract a crew to set or place the home on the foundation  and to finish the home on site 
the builder developer may construct the garage  patio and porches at the site and either sell the home directly to the consumer or through a realtor 
while the homes and production processes are similar to those used in our more traditional channel  as discussed in this item under products and production  the size and features of the homes often require more customization and engineering 
therefore  the builder developer generally provides a non refundable deposit before engineering and production begins 
the remaining portion of the purchase price is usually paid upon delivery of the home to the site 
the consumer pays for the home with cash  or through a construction loan or a real estate mortgage which the consumer arranges with a bank  mortgage company or hpm 
the homes sold through builders developers are usually placed in a subdivision in suburban areas  rather than in rural markets  and are generally larger and have more amenities than the homes we build for our traditional markets 
as a result  the wholesale price for these homes can be more than twice as much as the average price of our traditional homes 
therefore  we believe these consumers generally have higher household incomes than our traditional consumers 
some of the homes sold through builders developers are constructed to local building codes rather than the hud code as with our traditional market  including some that are two story homes and some homes with basements 
in addition  there is also a small  but growing segment of our homes sold through builders developers which are placed in urban redevelopment areas for consumers who purchase with government assistance or rent 
approximately of the homes sold to builders and developers in were modular homes constructed to local building codes 
we estimate that annual on site single family home completions have averaged over one million new homes  with approximately being built by  local builder developers building less than homes per year 
we believe that the majority of the builders developers we sold homes to in were building homes or less per year using as many as local subcontractors in secondary metropolitan areas 
we provide a faster  more efficient supply chain process than the traditional on site construction process 
our nationwide purchasing power also allows us to procure building materials at favorable prices 
the competition in the builder developer channel is primarily with on site builders 
there are regional competitors who also 
table of contents build homes off site and have a process similar to ours 
we estimate that modular home sales in the us were approximately  homes in however  with our genesis division  we are the only off site builder with a nationwide presence 
relationship with our employees at december   we had approximately  employees 
we deem our relationship with our employees to be generally good 
currently  our two manufacturing facilities in canada employ approximately workers that are subject to collective bargaining agreements which expire in november and june these employees represent approximately of our total current workforce 
the workforce of approximately employees at another of our manufacturing plants voted to unionize in but petitioned in april to withdraw from the union 
on january  an administrative law judge alj of the national labor relations board nlrb made findings that the company had engaged in unfair labor practices and therefore set aside the employees april  formal petition to end union representation 
the alj ordered that the company begin immediately to bargain with the union 
we believe that the alj s findings were incorrect and have appealed those findings and orders to the nlrb 
forward looking statements certain statements contained in this report  including our plans and beliefs regarding goals  ability to implement retail  manufacturing and finance strategies and the effects of those strategies  availability of liquidity and financing  new market initiatives and strategies  anticipated capital expenditures  outlook for the manufactured housing industry in particular and the economy in general  availability of wholesale and consumer financing  characterization of and our ability to control our contingent liabilities  demographic trends  and our ability to maintain supply and distribution networks could be construed to be forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities exchange act of in addition  we may or persons acting on our behalf may from time to time publish or communicate other items that could also be construed to be forward looking statements 
statements of this sort are or will be based on our estimates  assumptions and projections  and are subject to risks and uncertainties  including those specifically listed below that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in the forward looking statements 
we do not undertake to update our forward looking statements or risk factors to reflect future events or circumstances 
the following risk factors could materially affect our operating results or financial condition 
significant leverage our significant debt could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 
if we are unable to pay our debt obligations when due  we could be in default under our debt agreements and our lenders could accelerate our debt or take other actions which could restrict our operations 
as of december   we had long term debt of million  floor plan payable of million and warehouse borrowings of a consolidated third party entity of million 
this indebtedness could  among other things limit our ability to obtain future financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  surety bonds or other requirements  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and reduce our ability to use our cash flows for other purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the manufactured housing industry  place us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors with less indebtedness  and make us more vulnerable in the event of a continued downturn in our business or in general economic conditions 

table of contents in addition  our future cash flows may be insufficient to meet our debt service and other obligations 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations and proceeds may not be available to us from sales of manufactured home loans and contracts in connection with the warehouse facility and asset backed securitization or whole loan sale transactions in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund other liquidity needs 
the factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds through the sale of equity securities  the refinancing of debt or the sale of assets 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity 
we may not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we are unable to refinance our debt obligations  we could be in default under our debt agreements and our lenders could accelerate our debt or take other actions which could restrict our operations 
general industry conditions the current downturn in the manufactured housing industry has adversely affected our operating results 
if the current downturn does not reverse  our sales could decline and we may suffer further losses 
since mid the manufactured housing industry has experienced declining manufacturing shipments  tightened consumer credit standards  excess retail locations and inventory  reduced availability of consumer financing  high levels of homes repossessed from consumers  higher interest rates on manufactured housing loans relative to those generally available to site built home buyers  a reduced number of consumer and floor plan lenders and reduced floor plan availability in the industry 
during  the industry was also affected by an uncertain economic outlook and by texas legislation  effective january   that limits the use of home only financing to purchase a manufactured home 
based on reports published by ncsbcs  industry wholesale shipments of manufactured housing decreased in versus  from to and from to based on data reported by statistical surveys  inc and other sources  we estimate that industry retail sales of new homes declined in versus  from to and from to in addition  we estimate approximately  retail locations  or approximately of industry locations  and manufacturing facilities  or approximately of industry manufacturing facilities  have closed since mid largely as a result of these industry conditions  since mid we have closed homebuilding facilities  including one closed in march  in an attempt to return to profitability 
since june  we have closed retail sales locations 
these downsizing efforts have resulted in significant restructuring charges  including million in additionally  in and we recorded goodwill impairment charges totaling million and in recorded a valuation allowance for of our deferred tax assets  or million 
in  we reported pretax losses of million  including million of goodwill impairment charges 
in and  we reported pretax losses of million and million  respectively  including goodwill impairment charges of million in if the current downturn in the industry continues  our sales could continue to decline and we may incur further losses including additional closures or consolidations of existing operations  fixed asset impairment charges and goodwill impairment charges 
common stock and senior notes values our common stock price is depressed and may continue to decline or be highly volatile given current industry and economic conditions 
our senior notes are trading at discounts to face value 
our company s closing common stock price was on december   before the industry downturn began in mid the trading value per share of our stock has ranged from to during and and was as of december  additionally  our two issuances of senior notes continue to trade at discounts to their respective face values 
the market prices of our common stock and senior notes are affected by many factors including general economic and market conditions  interest rates  current manufactured housing industry forecasts  champion s and our competitors operating results  our ability to pay our debt obligations  consumer and wholesale financing availability  the market s perception of our strategies and the overall market fluctuations unrelated to our company or the manufactured housing industry 
all of these factors may adversely impact our common stock and senior notes market prices in the future 

table of contents fluctuations in operating results the cyclical and seasonal nature of the manufactured housing market causes our revenues and operating results to fluctuate 
we expect this fluctuation to continue in the future  which could result in operating losses during downturns 
the manufactured housing industry is highly cyclical and is influenced by many national and regional economic and demographic factors  including availability of financing for homebuyers and retailers  consumer confidence  interest rates  population and employment trends  income levels  housing demand  and general economic conditions  including inflation and recessions 
in addition  the manufactured housing industry is affected by seasonality 
sales during the period from march to november are traditionally higher than in other months 
as a result of the foregoing economic  demographic and seasonal factors  our revenues and operating results fluctuate  and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future 
moreover  we may experience operating losses during cyclical and seasonal downturns in the manufactured housing market 
consumer financing availability tightened credit standards  curtailed lending activity  tightened terms and increased interest rates among consumer lenders have reduced our sales 
if consumer financing were to become further curtailed or unavailable we could experience further sales declines 
the consumers who buy our homes have historically secured consumer financing from third party lenders 
the availability  terms and costs of consumer financing depend on the lending practices of financial institutions  governmental regulations and economic and other conditions  all of which are beyond our control 
a consumer seeking to finance the purchase of a manufactured home without land will generally pay a higher interest rate and have a shorter loan term than a consumer seeking to finance the purchase of land and the home 
manufactured home consumer financing is at times more difficult to obtain than financing for site built homes 
since  consumer lenders have tightened the credit underwriting standards and loan terms and increased interest rates for loans to purchase manufactured homes  which have reduced lending volumes and caused our sales to decline 
conseco has historically been one of the largest consumer lenders in the manufactured housing industry 
in october  conseco discontinued providing financing for the manufactured housing industry and filed a petition for bankruptcy in december the poor performance of portfolios of manufactured housing consumer loans in recent years has made it more difficult for industry consumer finance companies to obtain long term capital in the asset backed securitization market 
as a result  consumer finance companies have curtailed their industry lending and some have exited the manufactured housing market 
if consumer financing for manufactured homes were to become further curtailed or unavailable  we would likely experience further retail and manufacturing sales declines 
wholesale financing availability reduced number of floor plan lenders and reduced amount of credit allowed to industry retailers may result in lower inventory levels and lower sales at our independent retailers and fewer sales centers  which could also affect our level of wholesale shipments to these retailers 
independent retailers of our manufactured homes generally finance their inventory purchases with wholesale floor plan financing provided by lending institutions 
the number of floor plan lenders and their lending limits affect the availability of wholesale financing to retailers 
during the past five years some national wholesale lenders have exited the industry or curtailed their floor plan operations while a smaller number of national lenders and a large number of local and regional banks have entered the market or expanded their 
table of contents floor plan operations 
during  the industry s two largest floor plan lenders  conseco and deutsche financial services deutsche  who recently provided as much as approximately of the industry s wholesale financing  exited the business 
at december   our independent retailers had approximately million and million of floor plan loans for champion built homes outstanding with deutsche and conseco  respectively 
of these totals  about million and million was still under our repurchase obligation with deutsche and conseco  respectively 
the remaining floor plan lenders or new floor plan lenders entering the industry may change the terms of their loans as compared to the traditional terms of industry floor plan loans 
these changes could include higher interest rates  smaller advance rates  earlier or more significant principal payments or longer repurchase periods for the manufacturers 
therefore  industry retailers may be faced with tightened floor plan terms and weaker retailers may not qualify for floor plan financing at all 
reduced availability of floor plan lending or tighter floor plan terms may affect our independent retailers inventory levels of new homes  the number of retail sales centers and related wholesale demand 
retail sales to consumers at our independent retailers could also be affected by reduced retail inventory levels or reduced number of sales centers 
contingent liabilities we have  and will continue to have  significant contingent repurchase and other obligations  some of which may become actual obligations that we must repay 
in connection with a floor plan arrangement for our manufacturing shipments to independent retailers  the financial institution that provides the retailer financing customarily requires us to enter into a separate repurchase agreement with the financial institution 
under this separate agreement  for a period up to months from the date of our sale to the retailer  upon default by the retailer and repossession of the home by the financial institution  we are generally obligated to purchase from the lender the related floor plan loan or the home at a price equal to the unpaid principal amount of the loan  plus certain administrative and handling expenses  reduced by the amount of any damage to the home and any missing appliances 
we estimate our contingent repurchase obligation at december  was approximately million  before factoring in the resale value of the homes 
as of february   our largest independent retailer  a nationwide retailer  had approximately million of inventory subject to repurchase 
as of february  our next largest independent retailers had an aggregate of approximately million of inventory subject to repurchase  with individual amounts ranging from approximately million to million per retailer 
during  we paid million and incurred losses of million under repurchase agreements related to homes 
we may be required to honor some or all of our contingent repurchase obligations in the future and we may suffer additional losses with respect to  and as a consequence of  these repurchase agreements 
at december   we also had contingent debt obligations related to surety bonds and letters of credit totaling million of which million was collateralized with cash 
in january  we finalized a committed three year  million revolving credit facility to be used for letters of credit and general corporate purposes 
availability under this credit facility is limited to a borrowing base  and is collateralized by accounts receivable  inventories  property  plant and equipment and  to a lesser degree  cash and other assets 
upon completion of the new million credit facility  from january through march   substantially all of the fully cash collateralized letters of credit were terminated  resulting in the release to the company of restricted cash of million 
additionally  million of cash deposits were released to the company upon replacing cash collateral with letters of credit under the new credit facility 
as of march  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million and surety bonds totaling million 
at december   we also had guarantees by certain of our consolidated subsidiaries of million of debt of unconsolidated subsidiaries 
in addition  the company is contingently liable for up to million under an unconditional guaranty of a consolidated third party special purpose entity s million warehouse facility used to support our finance company s operations 
if we were required to fund a material amount of these contingent obligations  our liquidity would be adversely affected 

table of contents dependence upon independent retailers if we are unable to establish or maintain relationships with independent retailers who sell our homes  our sales could decline 
during  approximately of our manufacturing shipments of homes were made to independent retail locations throughout the united states and western canada 
as is common in the industry  independent retailers may sell manufactured homes produced by competing manufacturers 
we may not be able to establish relationships with new independent retailers or maintain good relationships with independent retailers that sell our homes 
even if we do establish and maintain relationships with independent retailers  these retailers are not obligated to sell our manufactured homes exclusively  and may choose to sell our competitors homes instead 
the independent retailers with whom we have relationships can cancel these relationships on short notice 
in addition  these retailers may not remain financially solvent as they are subject to the same industry  economic  demographic and seasonal trends that we face 
if we do not establish and maintain relationships with solvent independent retailers in one or more of our markets  sales in those markets could decline 
effect on liquidity current industry conditions and our recent operating results have limited our sources of capital 
if this situation does not improve and if we are unable to locate alternative sources of capital  we may be unable to expand or maintain our business 
we depend on our cash balances  cash flows from operations  revolving credit facility  floor plan facilities and proceeds from sales of manufactured home loans and contracts in connection with the warehouse facility  and will depend on anticipated proceeds of asset backed securitization or whole loan sale transactions  to finance our operating requirements  capital expenditures and other needs 
the downturn in the manufactured housing industry  combined with our recent operating results and other changes  have decreased sources of financing and required us to collateralize a portion of our surety bond and insurance program needs 
our warehouse facility has a typical one year term  and therefore must be renewed or replaced annually 
our current warehouse facility expires in april if the availability under our revolving credit and floor plan facilities  anticipated proceeds from sales of manufactured home loans and contracts in connection with the warehouse facility and asset backed securitization or whole loan sale transactions or cash flow from operations  including advance rates under floor plan arrangements with our company owned retailers  is insufficient to finance our operations and alternative capital is not available or if surety bonds become unavailable to us  we may be unable to expand or maintain our operations  and our business  results of operations and financial position could suffer 
as of december   we had surety bonds totaling million as collateral for our self insurance program and million for general operating purposes 
in we were required to provide additional collateral in support of our surety bond programs  resulting in total collateral at december   of million in cash and letters of credit 
if our current surety bond provider were to terminate these programs  we would seek alternative providers 
the inability to retain our current provider or obtain alternative bonding sources could have a negative impact on our liquidity 
entry into the consumer finance business we face risks as a new entrant to the consumer finance business 
although cit has operated a consumer finance business in the manufactured home sector for over years  and we have obtained the services of many of cit s former loan origination personnel in this business  we have limited experience operating a consumer finance business and are largely depending on these former cit personnel and other experienced management that we employ 
our previous loan origination business  which we operated through our subsidiary  homepride finance corp  originated some loans that did not qualify for sale to intended third party institutions  resulting in loan losses of approximately million 
our ability to increase our loan portfolio in connection with our new consumer finance business depends in part upon our ability to effectively market our consumer finance services to buyers of our manufactured homes and on the same general economic conditions affecting the consumer finance and manufactured housing industries 

table of contents we may incur losses as we develop our loan portfolio and integrate our consumer finance business into our existing operations 
moreover  due to our limited operating history and non participation in the securitization market to date  the manufactured home loans and contracts that we seek to securitize may receive lower ratings and may be subject to stricter underwriting standards than those of our competitors that have an established consumer finance record 
as a result  we may be required to bear a larger portion of the risk of loss on the financing agreements and may pay higher interest rates than our competitors 
additionally  our lack of experience in the whole loan sale market may impact the proceeds we receive from whole loan sales transactions 
these conditions could impact the performance of our consumer finance business and have a material adverse effect on our results and financial position 
funding for our new consumer finance business we face numerous risks associated with the funding of our new finance operations 
our consumer finance business has  to date  been funded with the proceeds from sales of our manufactured home loans and contracts in connection with a warehouse facility  a portion of the proceeds from the april issuance of million of senior notes due and cash from operations 
ultimately we expect to raise significant long term funding from asset backed securitization abs transactions or sales of whole loans 
adverse changes in the abs and whole loan sale markets  interest rates  the market for sales of manufactured homes or general economic conditions could impair our ability to raise sufficient long term funding  in which case we could be forced to sell our loans at a significant discount 
currently the abs market for manufactured housing related consumer loans is uncertain as a result of poor performance of such securities in recent years 
as a result  and due to our recent entry into the business  we may have difficulty accessing the abs market 
based on recent analysis we estimate that  if we were able to access the abs market  proceeds would range initially from to of the face amount of our loans  with the balance expected to be collected over time as the loans mature 
largely as a result of difficulties in that market  we estimate currently that proceeds from the sale of whole loans could approximate to of the carrying value of our loans  which would result in a loss being recognized upon the earlier of sale or classification of the loans to held for sale 
our warehouse line is the principal source of short term funding for our consumer finance business 
we are currently negotiating for a renewal of the warehouse line  which expires in april any such renewal could be on different terms  including advance rates  and is likely to be at a reduced size 
the warehouse line must be renewed  extended or replaced by april  otherwise we may be forced to exit the consumer finance business  which could have a further adverse effect on our ability to sell whole loans and would most likely preclude us from selling our loans in an abs transaction 
while we expect to be able to renew  extend or replace this warehouse line  in the event that we are unable to  we face further risk of loss on the loans which have been placed in that facility to date 
such loss exposure arises from the right of the agent to liquidate any loans placed in the warehouse line upon a termination of the facility 
while such liquidation must occur on commercially reasonable terms  our maximum loss exposure for loans placed in the warehouse facility  which we believe is unlikely to occur  is comprised of our approximately over collateralization of the loans plus our unconditional guarantee of up to of the total warehouse facility 
our maximum loss exposure  based on million of loans placed in and million of structured collateralized borrowings outstanding under the warehouse facility  was approximately million as of december  operation of our consumer finance business we face risks of loss related to manufactured home loans and contracts  including risks associated with defaults  delinquencies and prepayments  many of which are outside our control 
we face numerous additional risks in connection with our finance operations  many of which are outside our control 
many purchasers of manufactured homes may be deemed to be relatively high credit risks due to various factors  including the lack of or impaired credit histories and limited financial resources 
accordingly  the loans we originate may bear relatively high interest rates and may involve higher than average default and delinquency rates and servicing costs 
in the event that we foreclose on delinquent loans  our ability to sell the underlying collateral to recover or mitigate our loan losses will be subject to market valuations of the 
table of contents collateral 
these values may be affected by factors such as the amount of available inventory of manufactured homes in the market  the availability and terms of consumer financing and general economic conditions 
prepayments of our managed receivables  whether due to refinancing  repayments or foreclosures  in excess of management s estimates could adversely affect our future cash flow due to the resulting loss of net interest income on such prepaid receivables 
prepayments can result from a variety of factors  all of which are beyond our control  including changes in interest rates and general economic conditions 
the foregoing risks become more acute in any economic slowdown or recession 
periods of economic slowdown or recession may be accompanied by decreased demand for consumer credit and declining asset values 
delinquencies  foreclosures and losses generally increase during economic slowdowns or recessions 
loss of employment  increases in cost of living  increases in rents on leased land for homes in manufactured housing communities or other adverse economic conditions would likely impair the ability of our consumer borrowers to meet their payment obligations  which could impair our ability to continue to fund our finance operations 
competition the manufactured housing industry is very competitive 
if we are unable to effectively compete  our growth could be limited and our sales could decline 
the manufactured housing industry is highly competitive at both the manufacturing and retail levels  with competition based upon several factors  including price  product features  reputation for service and quality  merchandising  terms of retailer promotional programs and the terms of consumer financing 
numerous companies produce manufactured homes in our markets 
a number of our manufacturing competitors also have their own retail distribution systems and consumer finance operations 
in addition  there are many independent manufactured housing retail locations in most areas where we have retail operations 
because barriers to entry for manufactured housing retailers are low  we believe that it is relatively easy for new retailers to enter into our markets as competitors 
in addition  our products compete with other forms of low to moderate cost housing  including site built homes  panelized homes  apartments  townhouses and condominiums 
if we are unable to effectively compete in this environment  our retail sales and manufacturing shipments could be reduced 
as a result  our growth could be limited and our sales could decline 
zoning if the manufactured housing industry is not able to secure favorable local zoning ordinances  our sales could decline and our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
limitations on the number of sites available for placement of manufactured homes or on the operation of manufactured housing communities could reduce the demand for manufactured homes and our sales 
manufactured housing communities and individual home placements are subject to local zoning ordinances and other local regulations relating to utility service and construction of roadways 
in the past  property owners often have resisted the adoption of zoning ordinances permitting the location of manufactured homes in residential areas  which we believe has restricted the growth of the industry 
manufactured homes may not receive widespread acceptance and localities may not adopt zoning ordinances permitting the development of manufactured home communities 
if the manufactured housing industry is unable to secure favorable local zoning ordinances  our sales could decline and our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
dependence upon walter r 
young and other key personnel the loss of any of our executive officers could reduce our ability to achieve our business plan and could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we depend on the continued services and performance of our executive officers  including our chairman  president and chief executive officer  walter r 
young 
if we lose the service of mr 
young or any of our executive officers  it could limit our ability to achieve our business plan and could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

table of contents certain elements of our business strategy may not succeed our business strategy may not adequately address the issues currently facing our company and the manufactured housing industry or correctly identify future trends in the industry 
any failure of our business strategy could cause our sales to decline 
since mid  retail sales and manufacturing shipments of new manufactured homes have decreased as a result of high consumer repossession levels  tightened consumer credit standards  excess retail locations and inventory  a reduced number of consumer lenders in the industry  higher interest rates on consumer loans and a reduced number of floor plan lenders in the industry 
as a result  our operating results have been adversely affected and we have closed a significant number of manufacturing facilities and retail sales centers 
we are implementing strategies designed to address these issues 
these strategies may not be successful because the reasons for the decline in demand or future trends in the industry may not be correctly identified  and our operating results may not improve 
in addition  factors beyond our control  such as increased competition  reductions in consumer demand or continued economic downturn  may offset any improved operating results that are attributable to our strategy 
any failure of our business strategy could cause our sales to decline 
restrictive covenants the terms of our debt place operating restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and contain various financial performance and other covenants with which we must remain in compliance 
if we do not remain in compliance with these covenants  certain of our debt facilities could be terminated and the amounts outstanding thereunder could become immediately due and payable 
the documents governing the terms of our senior notes  primarily the senior notes due  contain covenants that place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries 
the terms of our debt agreements include covenants that  to varying degrees  restrict our and our subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness  contingent liabilities and liens  issue additional preferred stock  pay dividends or make other distributions on our common stock  redeem or repurchase common stock and redeem  repay or repurchase subordinated debt  make investments in subsidiaries that are not restricted subsidiaries  enter into joint ventures  use assets as security in other transactions  sell certain assets or enter into sale and leaseback transactions  restrict the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions on their common stock  engage in new lines of business  guarantee or secure indebtedness  consolidate with or merge with or into other companies  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
if we fail to comply with any of these covenants  the trustees could cause our debt to become due and payable prior to maturity 
if this debt were to be accelerated  our assets might not be sufficient to repay our debt in full 
the debt incurrence covenant in the indenture governing the senior notes due currently limits additional debt to i a working capital line of credit up to a borrowing base equal to of otherwise unencumbered inventories and of otherwise unencumbered accounts receivable  ii warehouse financing meeting certain parameters up to million  iii other debt up to million  and iv ordinary course indebtedness and contingent obligations that includes non speculative hedging obligations  floor plan financing  
table of contents letters of credit  surety bonds  bankers acceptances  repurchase agreements related to retailer floor plan financing and guaranties of additional debt otherwise permitted to be incurred 
the resulting effect at december   when combined with limits in our senior notes due  was a working capital line of credit limit of approximately million of which no more than approximately million of cash borrowings could be secured debt 
the million warehouse facility we arranged in april contains certain covenants with which we were not in compliance as of june  we subsequently obtained waivers for the non compliance and amendments to revise the covenant terms 
as amended  the warehouse facility requires us to maintain a minimum ratio of earnings before interest expense and taxes ebit to interest expense and minimum adjusted tangible net worth of million 
under the facility  champion must also maintain minimum unsecured senior debt ratings of b by standard poor s s p and b by moody s investors service moody s and perform certain other duties thereunder 
we were in compliance with the amended covenants for the quarters ended september  and december  in september  moody s completed a review of the company and confirmed the then existing rating of b on the senior notes due but revised the rating outlook from stable to negative 
in february  s p lowered its rating on the company s senior notes due to b with a negative outlook 
further negative ratings actions by moody s or s p would cause a termination event under the million warehouse facility 
a negative ratings action also could affect the company s ability to obtain or maintain various forms of business credit  including but not limited to letters of credit  surety bonds  trade payables and floor plan financing  or could result in the company having to provide additional collateral related thereto 
if our operating results do not improve we may again not comply with one or more of the covenants under the million warehouse facility  which  if not cured or amended  would result in a termination event 
in a termination event  the agent bank could discontinue making further advances under the facility and enact alternate waterfall provisions that would reduce or eliminate current payments to the consolidated third party special purpose entity from the underlying consumer loans 
if the agent were to discontinue further advances  we would seek other sources of capital for our consumer finance operations  though there is no assurance that alternate sources of capital could be found 
a termination event under the million warehouse facility would not trigger a default under the indentures related to the senior notes due and we also have a million floor plan financing facility that previously contained a covenant that we would not have been in compliance with for the quarter ending september  this covenant was amended in september and we were in compliance with the new covenant at december  effective january  the covenant was amended to primarily require the maintenance of million of cash and cash equivalents 
if we were to be out of compliance with this new covenant  the lender could terminate the credit line and cause the debt to become immediately due and payable 
as of december   we had approximately million outstanding under this facility 
in january  we finalized a committed three year  million revolving credit facility to be used for letters of credit and general corporate purposes 
availability under this credit facility is limited to a borrowing base  and is collateralized by accounts receivable  inventories  property  plant and equipment and  to a lesser degree  cash and other assets 
the agreement contains certain financial covenants that require the company  only in the event that its liquidity falls below million  to maintain certain levels of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda and certain ratios of ebitda to fixed charges  as defined in the agreement 
in addition the facility contains covenants that limit the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens  and  if liquidity falls below million  make certain investments  pay dividends and purchase or redeem its common stock 
as of march   million of letters of credit were outstanding on this line and the company was in compliance with all covenants 

table of contents potential dilution outstanding preferred stock that is convertible into common stock and redeemable for common stock and in some cases  at the company s option  for cash and a deferred purchase price obligation that is payable  at the company s option  in cash or common stock  could result in potential dilution and impair the price of our common stock

at december   we had outstanding million of series c cumulative convertible preferred stock with a seven year term  which was convertible into common stock at a rate of per share 
on january   the terms of the series c preferred stock were amended to accelerate the modification of the conversion price to per share and the preferred shareholder agreed to convert million of series c preferred stock by march  upon conversion million shares of common stock were issued 
after this conversion there was million of series c preferred stock outstanding 
commencing march   the preferred shareholder has the right to redeem this preferred stock for common stock  and  at our option  partially for cash 
we pay a quarterly dividend on the preferred stock at a rate of per annum 
the dividend is payable in cash or shares of our common stock  at our option 
the number of shares issuable in payment of these dividends depends on the market value of the common stock at the time of issuance subject to certain limitations 
as a result  assuming we elected to pay any dividend in shares of common stock  the preferred shareholder would receive a greater number of shares of common stock in payment of those dividends if our common stock price decreases 
we currently have outstanding a warrant which was initially exercisable based on approximately million shares of common stock at a strike price of per share 
in accordance with the terms of the warrant  on august  the number of shares under warrant and the strike price were reset at million shares and per share  respectively 
beginning on april   the warrant strike price will increase annually by per share 
the warrant expires on april  the warrant is exercisable only on a non cash  net basis  whereby the warrant holder would receive shares of common stock as payment for the net gain upon exercise 
as of december   we had outstanding million of a deferred purchase price obligation which is payable in quarterly installments of million through january  quarterly installments may be made in cash or shares of common stock  at our option 
the number of shares to be issued in any quarterly payment depends on the availability of registered shares of common stock and the market value of the common stock at the time of issuance 
as a result  assuming we elected to pay any quarterly installment in shares of common stock  the recipients would receive a greater number of shares of common stock in payment of those installments if our common stock price decreases 
in january  we issued million shares of common stock as payment for the quarterly installment then due 
to the extent that the preferred shareholder elects to convert the preferred stock into common stock or redeem the preferred stock for common stock or we elect to make preferred dividend payments or the deferred purchase price obligation payments in common stock  our then existing common shareholders would experience dilution in their percentage ownership interests

the homes we produce were sold through company owned sales centers in states at december   through approximately  independent sales centers across the us and western canada and directly to builders and developers 
at december   independent retailer locations were members of our champion home centers chc retail distribution network 
in  we also provided a limited amount of financing for consumers who purchased champion built homes from our company owned sales centers and our independent chc retailers 
in  our revenues and profits were affected by challenging industry conditions including reductions in the availability of consumer financing  reductions in floor plan inventory financing  high levels of homes repossessed from consumers  an uncertain economic outlook and texas legislation  effective january   that limits the use of home only financing to purchase a manufactured home 
during  conseco finance corp 
conseco  formerly the manufactured housing industry s largest floor plan and consumer lender  exited the market 
also in  deutsche financial services deutsche exited the manufactured housing floor plan lending business

we estimate that approximately  repossessed homes were resold in  compared to a similar number of homes in and approximately  homes in according to data reported by the national conference of states on building codes and standards ncsbcs  us industry wholesale shipments of hud code homes and floors decreased and  respectively  from levels after declining and  respectively  in from levels 
we estimate  based on data reported by statistical surveys  inc and other sources  that industry retail sales of new homes in declined from levels  after declining in from levels 
in the fourth quarter of  the industry experienced a decline in year over year wholesale shipments of hud code homes  based on data reported by ncsbcs 
in response to these industry conditions and their effect on our sales volume and operating results  during we closed  or  of our manufacturing facilities  and  or  of our retail sales centers operated at the beginning of the year 
in connection with the closing and consolidation of our manufacturing facilities and retail sales centers  we recorded pretax restructuring charges totaling million 
see restructuring charges below for additional discussion 
since the industry downturn began in mid  we have closed and consolidated manufacturing facilities  including one facility closed in march  and since mid we have closed retail sales locations to eliminate under performing operations and rationalize our operations and capacity for industry conditions 
we believe the closures will enable us to reduce operating losses while current industry conditions persist 
the number of manufactured homes that are sold to consumers and related wholesale demand are significantly affected by the availability  credit underwriting standards  terms and cost of consumer financing 
two basic types of consumer financing are available home only or personal property loans for purchasers of only the home  and real estate mortgages for purchasers of the home and the land on which the home is placed 
during the past four years a number of consumer lenders have exited the market 
the remaining us manufactured homes are constructed in accordance with the federal manufactured home construction and safety standards  as administered by the us department of housing and urban development hud 
the hud code regulates manufactured home design and construction  strength and durability  fire resistance and energy efficiency hud code homes 
other building codes apply to modular homes and homes built in canada 
a floor is a section of a home 
a single section home is comprised of one floor and a multi section home is comprised of two or more floors 

table of contents lenders have increased their credit standards and interest rates and have tightened terms and underwriting standards which have reduced lending volumes 
we estimate that the percentage of total new manufactured home retail sales financed with home only loans has declined from approximately in to less than in  based on a survey by the manufactured housing institute mhi  an industry trade association 
since the late s  the number of manufactured homes financed with real estate mortgages has been growing 
we estimate that the percentage of total new manufactured home retail sales financed with real estate mortgages has increased from approximately in to in retailers of manufactured homes generally finance their inventory purchases from the manufacturers with wholesale floor plan financing 
the availability and cost of floor plan financing can affect the amount of retailer inventory of new homes  the number of retail sales centers and related wholesale demand 
prior to  the availability of floor plan financing had not been a significant issue 
although some wholesale lenders have exited the market or curtailed their lending volumes  new lenders  including local and regional banks  have entered the market and some lenders have increased lending volumes 
certain of the remaining floor plan lenders have increased their underwriting standards and tightened the terms of their loans 
we believe our manufacturing shipments in were reduced as a result of independent retailers transitioning to alternative inventory financing sources 
the industry s us manufacturing shipments and retail sales of new homes in could continue to suffer from the factors described above 
we expect our manufacturing and retail sales volumes and margins to be affected until industry consumer financing is more readily available  consumer repossession levels decline and retail sales of new homes increase 
we are focusing on matching our manufacturing capacity and number of company owned retail outlets to industry conditions  improving or eliminating under performing manufacturing facilities and retail outlets  improving independent and company owned retailer inventory turnover  rewarding independent retailers for retail selling of homes purchased from our manufacturers and promoting sound business practices at our independent retailers 
we are seeking additional sources of consumer lending for our retailers 
we also seek to expand our manufacturers sales of homes to builders and developers 
we continually review our manufacturing capacity and the number and locations of company owned retail sales centers and will make further adjustments as deemed necessary

at december   we were operating fewer manufacturing facilities and fewer retail sales centers than we operated at december  the reduction in sales volumes was a result of industry conditions mentioned above  which also resulted in our reduction of manufacturing operating capacity and closure of retail sales centers 
gross margin dollars in declined million from  of which million was due to lower sales volumes and million was due to lower gross margin as a percentage of sales 
the lower gross margin rate was primarily caused by million in restructuring charges see additional discussion under restructuring charges and approximately million in higher self insurance costs  of which million was due to increasing our self insurance reserves based on an actuarial study completed during the third quarter  and million was due to increased claims  partially as a result of plant closures 
in addition  gross margin in was reduced by approximately million due to other retail inventory liquidation programs primarily for the sale to consumers of inventory from closed retail locations 
excluding restructuring charges  higher self insurance costs and effects of other retail inventory liquidation programs  gross margin as a percent of sales declined from in to in this variance is due to costs of winding down operations at closed plants  a higher manufacturing overhead rate related to fixed costs and lower levels of plant utilization and inefficiencies from lower production volumes and lower backlogs

in reconciling results by segment  a credit income resulted from the reduction in intercompany profit in inventory due to declining inventories at the retail segment 
in  the effects of declining retail inventory levels were offset by increased manufacturing margins resulting in no change to the intercompany profit in inventory elimination 
general corporate expenses increased in primarily due to a million restructuring charge related to exiting certain development operations and million of severance for staff reductions at the company s corporate office 
the results also include gains on extinguishment of debt totaling million as we purchased and retired million of our senior notes due for approximately million and settled indebtedness related to our development operations 
goodwill impairment charges we adopted sfas no 
in january under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to testing for impairment upon adoption  and at least annually  or more frequently if certain events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that a two step evaluation be performed to assess goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment 
our reporting units consist of our three business segments manufacturing  retail and financial services 
first the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  goodwill and other intangible assets are not impaired and proceeding to the second step is not required 
if the carrying value of any reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill must be determined and compared to the carrying value of its goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded 
we performed our transitional test for goodwill impairment upon adoption of sfas no 
as of the beginning of and concluded no material impairment of the carrying value of goodwill existed at that date 
in the second quarter of  as a result of the significant downsizing of our retail operations in reaction to continuing challenging industry conditions and in accordance with sfas no 
 we performed a test for goodwill impairment using the income approach 
under this method  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life 
in the application of this present value method  we were required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables 
actual future results and other assumed variables could differ from these estimates 
in our application of the income approach  we assumed a cash flow period of five years  a discount rate of and a terminal value of the fifth year s estimated future cash flows for the next five years  present valued 
the results of this impairment test indicated that the implied fair value of the retail goodwill was less than its carrying value  resulting in an impairment charge of million which was recorded in the quarter ended june  restructuring charges as a result of the industry conditions mentioned above and their effects on our sales volume and operating results  during we closed and consolidated retail sales centers and manufacturing facilities  and reduced our corporate office staff 
in addition  as of october   we sold our interest in the sunchamp joint venture  which consisted of leased communities  to sun communities  inc and closed our communities management and development operations in the fourth quarter of in  we recorded

fixed asset impairment charges for closed manufacturing facilities were primarily based on our estimates of net sales values for permanent closures and estimated future cash flows for temporary closures 
manufacturing inventory charges were for obsolescence related to the consolidation of product lines and models as a result of the plant closings and the elimination of certain stock keeping units 
additional warranty costs were provided due to expected higher costs to service homes after the closure of plants in certain areas 
manufacturing severance costs were related to the termination of substantially all employees at the manufacturing facilities closed and include payments made to hourly employees under the worker adjustment and retraining notification act and severance payments to qualifying salaried employees 
approximately  employees were terminated at the facilities closed in all of the severance costs had been paid by year end 
retail lease termination charges consist of accruals of future lease payments or settlements for closed sales centers 
at december   the unpaid portion of the lease termination charges totaled million 
fixed asset impairment charges were due to writing off the net book value of leasehold improvements that were abandoned at the closed sales centers 
inventory charges represented estimated losses for the wholesale liquidation of certain new home inventory at closed sales centers and estimated lower of cost or market charges for inventory of land and park spaces and improvements for closed sales centers 
during  new homes were liquidated in bulk sales to other resellers resulting in losses totaling million 

table of contents retail severance costs were related to the termination of qualifying employees 
approximately retail employees were terminated as a result of the sales center closings 
in reconciling total restructuring charges on a segment basis  a credit income of million resulted from the reduction in intercompany profit in inventory due to the decline in inventories at the retail operations as a result of the bulk sale of certain new home inventory mentioned above 
development restructuring charges included a million loss on the sale of our interest in sunchamp

goodwill impairment charges prior to the adoption of sfas no 
in january of  we evaluated the recoverability of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this standard required the evaluation of long lived assets based on the asset s estimated fair value which was determined using the present value of estimated future cash flows 
at the time such evaluations indicated that the undiscounted future cash flows of certain long lived assets were not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets  the assets were adjusted to their estimated fair values 
industry conditions in  including excess retail locations and inventory  tightened consumer credit standards  high consumer repossession levels and higher interest rates for purchasers of manufactured housing  resulted in lower sales volumes and sales center closures for the company s acquired retail businesses 
during the second half of  certain of the company s retail acquisitions incurred operating losses  and we closed and consolidated under performing retail sales centers 
the culmination of these factors triggered a review of the recoverability of long lived assets 

table of contents in the evaluation process we forecasted cash flows over the next years using assumptions for each company 
the resulting cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount factor that approximated the company s blended cost of capital of 
the assessment was performed using lower volume and growth assumptions than previously assumed due to the continued downturn in the industry and lowered future expectations

finance costs and expenses include or will include interest expense from indebtedness under the warehouse facility and securitizations  provision for credit losses  gain or loss on whole loan sale transactions and operating costs 
alternatively  we may also seek to sell some or all of the loans funded by the warehouse facility from time to time through privately negotiated whole loan sale transactions 
upon classification of loans to held for sale in anticipation of whole loan sales  the carrying value of the loans will be accounted for at the lower of cost or market 
in the event that we sell our loans it is unlikely that we will retain any servicing rights or obligations 
a gain or loss on sale will be recognized for the difference between the selling price  net of expenses  and the carrying value of the loans 
when whole loan sales occur  the loans receivable and related liabilities structured as collateralized borrowings will be removed from the balance sheet and no further interest income or expense will be recognized for the loans that were sold 
currently the abs market for manufactured housing related consumer loans is uncertain as a result of poor performance of such securities in recent years 
as a result  and due to our recent entry into the business  we may have difficulty accessing the abs market 
based on recent analysis we estimate that  if we were able to access the abs market  proceeds would range initially from to of the face amount of our loans  with the balance expected to be collected over time as the loans mature 
largely as a result of difficulties in that market  we estimate currently that proceeds from the sale of whole loans could approximate to of the carrying value of our loans  which would result in a loss being recognized upon the earlier of sale or classification of loans to held for sale 
our warehouse line is the principal source of short term funding for our consumer finance business 
we are currently negotiating a renewal of the warehouse line  which expires in april any such renewal could be on different terms  including advance rates  and is likely to be at a reduced size 
the warehouse line must be renewed  extended or replaced by april  otherwise we may be forced to exit the consumer finance business  which could have a further adverse effect on our ability to sell whole loans and would most likely preclude us from selling our loans in an abs transaction 
while we expect to be able to renew  extend or replace this warehouse line  in the event that we are unable to  we face further risk of loss on the loans which have been placed in that facility to date 
contingent repurchase obligations we are contingently obligated under repurchase agreements with certain lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to independent retailers 
upon default by a retailer under a floor plan financing agreement with an associated repurchase agreement  the repurchase agreement generally requires the manufacturer to repurchase the loan or the home for the factory invoice price  subject to various adjustments 
in the event of such repurchases  the manufacturer s loss is equal to the difference between the repurchase price factory invoice and the net resale price to another retailer 
in the fourth quarter of  we changed a majority of our volume rebate programs to provide for payment of the rebate after sale of the home by the retailer to a consumer  at which time the company has no further repurchase exposure for the home 
currently  in the event we are requested to repurchase homes upon retailer defaults  we are able to offset a portion of the loss with the related accrued rebates which will not be paid 
our policy of paying rebates upon retail sale of the home promotes prudent inventory and floor plan leverage management by retailers and has resulted in a reduced number of defaults and reduced severity of losses upon repurchase 
we use information from the primary national floor plan lenders as the basis of our estimate of our contingent repurchase obligation 
with the exit of certain national floor plan lenders from the industry and the shift to alternative retail inventory financing sources  the estimate of our contingent repurchase obligation may not be precise 
each quarter we review our contingent wholesale repurchase obligations for independent retailers to assess the adequacy of the reserve for repurchase losses 
this analysis is based on the combination of current and historical experience  reports received from three of the primary national floor plan lenders that 
table of contents provide approximately of all floor plan financing for our independent retailers  and information regarding our retailers obtained from management at our manufacturing facilities 
the estimated repurchase obligation is calculated as the total amount that would be paid upon the default of all of our independent retailers whose inventories are subject to repurchase agreements  without reduction for the resale value of the repurchased homes 
potential losses under repurchase obligations are determined by the difference between the repurchase price and the estimated net resale value of the homes  less accrued rebates 
each month we use the information from these three primary lenders to determine the amount subject to repurchase and the estimated potential loss for each of our largest independent retailers 
as of february   our largest independent retailer  a nationwide retailer  had million of inventory subject to repurchase 
as of february  our next largest independent retailers had an aggregate of million of inventory subject to repurchase  with individual amounts ranging from million to million per retailer 
a summary of actual repurchase activity for the last three years follows dollars in millions estimated repurchase obligation at end of year number of retailers defaults number of homes repurchased total repurchase price losses incurred on homes repurchased our estimated contingent repurchase obligation has been declining due to reduced inventory at our independent retailers and due to an estimated of independent retailer inventory being financed at local banks  with whom we do not always enter into repurchase agreements 
not included in repurchase losses in the table above was a million charge taken in for an additional write down of repurchased homes from the bankruptcy of our former largest independent retailer 
liquidity and capital resources unrestricted cash balances totaled million at december   up from million at december  during  cash of million was provided by the net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes due  million from the net proceeds of the issuance of preferred stock  million of proceeds from sales of consumer loans into the warehouse facility and million of proceeds from the sale of eight closed manufacturing facilities and other properties 
expenditures during included million of net cash used for operations  million to reduce floor plan borrowings  million to cash collateralize letters of credit  million to originate consumer loans  million for the repurchase of senior notes due  million for acquisition related payments  million for capital improvements  million of deferred financing costs  million for investments in and advances to unconsolidated subsidiaries and million of other debt payments 
during  inventories declined million primarily due to liquidating inventory from the closure of retail sales centers and manufacturing facilities 
other current assets increased due to cash collateral deposits totaling million made for insurance and surety bond requirements and refundable income taxes totaling approximately million related to the tax benefit of our net operating loss carryback  partially offset by million of income tax refunds received during other non current assets rose due to the increase in deferred financing costs associated with the senior notes due and the warehouse credit facility 

table of contents during the year ended december   the following transactions were completed we received net proceeds of million from the issuance of million of redeemable convertible preferred stock 
the net proceeds were used to cash collateralize a portion of our letters of credit in connection with the termination of our revolving credit agreement  as discussed below 
we terminated our previous revolving credit agreement which was a million secured line of credit 
we arranged to have a bank provide million of letters of credit on a fully cash collateralized basis 
one of our subsidiaries issued million of senior notes due with interest payable semi annually at an annual rate of 
the net proceeds from the offering of approximately million were used to finance the acquisition of the manufactured housing loan origination business of cit  to repay a portion of our debt  including a significant portion of our floor plan payable  to provide working capital for our existing business segments and our new consumer financing business  and for general corporate purposes 
the senior notes due contain covenants which  among other things  limit the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  issue additional redeemable preferred stock  pay dividends on or repurchase common stock  make certain investments and incur liens on assets 
the debt incurrence covenant in the notes currently limits additional debt to a working capital line of credit up to a borrowing base equal to of otherwise unencumbered inventories and of otherwise unencumbered accounts receivable  warehouse financing meeting certain parameters up to million  other debt up to million  and ordinary course indebtedness and contingent obligations that includes non speculative hedging obligations  floor plan financing  letters of credit  surety bonds  bankers acceptances  repurchase agreements related to retailer floor plan financing and guaranties of additional debt otherwise permitted to be incurred 
the resulting effects at december   on a working capital line of credit when combined with limits in our senior notes due  was a limit of approximately million of which no more than approximately million of cash borrowings could be secured debt 
these limits were approximately million higher at march  we completed the acquisition of the manufactured housing loan origination business of cit for approximately million 
we arranged a million warehouse facility to support our finance company s operations 
consumer loans originated by our finance company are sold in exchange for cash proceeds under the warehouse line 
we purchased and retired million of our senior notes due for approximately million 
we repaid approximately million of our floor plan borrowings  including all amounts due conseco and all but million due deutsche 
our outstanding balance of floor plan borrowings at december  totaled approximately million 
from time to time  as a sufficient amount of manufactured home loans and contracts that satisfy established underwriting guidelines are accumulated  we expect the warehouse facility will be repaid  in whole or in part  with proceeds from the sale of debt obligations or other securities in the abs markets 
we expect these debt obligations or other securities will be secured by the underlying manufactured home loans and contracts purchased by the consolidated special purpose entities from our new consumer finance business 
alternatively  we may also seek to sell some or all of the loans funded by the warehouse facility from time to time through privately negotiated whole loan sale transactions 
currently the abs market for manufactured housing related consumer loans is uncertain as a result of poor performance of such securities in recent years 
as a result  and due to our recent entry into the business  we may have difficulty accessing the abs market

table of contents our warehouse line is the principal source of short term funding for our consumer finance business 
we are currently negotiating a renewal of the warehouse line  which expires in april any such renewal could be on different terms  including advance rates  and is likely to be at a reduced size 
the warehouse line must be renewed  extended or replaced by april  otherwise we may be forced to exit the consumer finance business  which could have a further adverse effect on our ability to sell whole loans and would most likely preclude us from selling our loans in an abs transaction 
while we expect to be able to renew  extend or replace this warehouse line  in the event that we are unable to  we face further risk of loss on the loans which have been placed in that facility to date 
the warehouse facility contains covenants with which we were not in compliance as of june  we subsequently obtained waivers for the noncompliance and amendments to revise the covenants 
as amended  the warehouse facility requires us to maintain a minimum ratio of earnings before interest expense and taxes ebit to interest expense and minimum adjusted tangible net worth of million 
under the warehouse facility  champion must also maintain minimum unsecured senior debt ratings of b by standard poor s s p and b by moody s investors service moody s and perform certain other duties thereunder 
we were in compliance with the amended covenants for the quarters ended september  and december  in september  moody s completed a review of the company and confirmed the then existing rating of b on the senior notes due but revised its ratings outlook from stable to negative 
in february  s p lowered its rating on the company s senior notes due to b with a negative outlook 
further negative ratings actions by moody s or s p would cause a termination event under the million warehouse facility 
negative ratings actions also could affect the company s ability to obtain or maintain various forms of business credit  including but not limited to letters of credit  surety bonds  trade payables and floor plan financing  or could result in the company having to place additional collateral related thereto 
if our operating results do not improve we may again become noncompliant with one or more of the warehouse facility covenants  which  if not cured or amended  would result in a termination event under the facility 
in a termination event  the agent bank could discontinue making further advances under the facility and enact alternate waterfall provisions thereunder that would reduce or eliminate current payments to the consolidated third party special purpose entity from the underlying consumer loans 
a termination event could result in the ability of the agent bank to liquidate the loans held under the warehouse facility in a commercially reasonable manner and on commercially reasonable terms 
if the agent bank were to discontinue further advances or liquidate the loans we would seek other sources of capital for our consumer finance operations  though there is no assurance that alternate sources of capital could be found 
a termination event under the warehouse facility would not trigger a default under the indentures related to the senior notes due or we also have a million floor plan financing facility that previously contained a covenant that we would not have been in compliance with for the quarter ending september  this covenant was amended in september and we were in compliance with the new covenant at december  effective january  the covenant was amended to primarily require the maintenance of million of cash and cash equivalents 
if we were to be out of compliance with this new covenant  the lender could terminate the credit line and cause the debt to become immediately due and payable 
as of december   we had approximately million outstanding under this facility 
in january  we finalized a committed three year  million revolving credit facility to be used for letters of credit and general corporate purposes 
availability under this credit facility is limited to a borrowing base  and is collateralized by accounts receivable  inventories  property  plant and equipment and  to a lesser degree  cash and other assets 
the agreement contains certain financial covenants that require the company  only in the event that its liquidity falls below million  to maintain certain levels of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda and certain ratios of ebitda to fixed charges  as defined in the agreement 
in addition  the facility contains covenants that limit the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens  and  if liquidity falls below million  make certain investments  pay 
table of contents dividends and purchase or redeem its common stock 
as of march   million of letters of credit were outstanding on this line and the company was in compliance with all covenants 
upon completion of the new million credit facility  from january through march   substantially all of the fully cash collateralized letters of credit were terminated resulting in the release to the company of restricted cash of million that had been held as collateral 
additionally  million of cash deposits were released to the company upon replacing cash collateral for surety bonds with letters of credit under the new credit facility 
we had significant contingent obligations at december   including an estimated wholesale repurchase obligation of approximately million  surety bonds and letters of credit totaling million of which million was cash collateralized and guarantees by certain of our consolidated subsidiaries of million of debt of unconsolidated subsidiaries 
in addition  as of december   the company was contingently liable for up to million under an unconditional guaranty of a consolidated third party special purpose entity s million warehouse facility to support our finance company s operations 
at december   million was outstanding under the warehouse facility and was reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
if we were required to fund a material amount of these contingent obligations  our liquidity would be adversely affected 
the company has provided various representations  warranties and other standard indemnifications in the ordinary course of its business  in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements 
the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of its business 
management believes the ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company leases most of its retail sales centers  certain of its other facilities and certain manufacturing equipment under operating leases 
future minimum lease payments under these operating leases total million at december   as follows million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  and million thereafter 
during the quarter ended june   we purchased and retired million of our senior notes due for million 
in through march  in several separate transactions  we purchased and retired million of our senior notes for million 
our two issuances of senior notes continue to trade at discounts to their respective face values 
we continuously evaluate the most efficient use of our capital  including without limitation  purchasing  refinancing or otherwise retiring our outstanding indebtedness  debt exchanges  restructuring of obligations  financings  and issuances of securities  whether in the open market or by other means and to the extent permitted by our financing arrangements 
we will evaluate any such transactions in light of then existing market conditions 
the amounts involved in any such transactions  individually or in the aggregate  may be material we plan to spend less than million in on capital expenditures 
the company does not plan to pay cash dividends on its common stock in the near term 
we believe that our cash balances  cash flows from operations  expected income tax refunds  availability under our new revolving credit facility and our floor plan facilities  proceeds under the warehouse facility from sales of consumer loans originated by our finance business  and proceeds from any asset backed securitizations in the capital markets or whole loan sales of loans originated  will be adequate to meet our anticipated financing needs  operating requirements and capital expenditures for the next months 
in the event one or more of our capital resources were to become unavailable  we would revise our operating strategies accordingly 
accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
assumptions and 
table of contents estimates of future earnings and cash flow are used in the periodic analyses of the recoverability of goodwill  deferred tax assets  and property  plant and equipment 
historical experience and trends are used to estimate reserves  including reserves for self insured risks  warranty costs and wholesale repurchase losses 
following is a description of each accounting policy requiring significant judgments and estimates goodwill the company tests for goodwill impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company evaluates each reporting unit s fair value versus its carrying value annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may exceed the fair value of the reporting unit 
when estimating a unit s fair value  the company calculates the present value of future cash flows based on forecasted sales volumes  the number of retail sales centers and homebuilding facilities in operation  current industry and economic conditions  historical results and inflation 
as a result of the continued downturn in the manufactured housing industry  in we closed retail sales centers and manufacturing facilities 
in connection with the significant reduction in our retail operations  we re evaluated the fair value of retail goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
as a result  we recorded a pretax  non cash impairment charge of million for retail goodwill in the quarter ended june  significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in calculating the fair value of goodwill or differences between estimates and actual results could result in additional impairment charges in the future 
income taxes deferred tax assets and income tax refunds deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement balances and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the company periodically evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets based on the requirements established in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recording of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
it further states  forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
we incurred pretax losses in  and totaling million  including goodwill impairment charges of million in and million in our industry continues to be challenged by limited availability of consumer financing  high industry consumer repossession levels  reductions in wholesale floor plan lending availability and an uncertain economic outlook  resulting in a continued decline in manufacturing shipments and retail sales 
in the absence of specific favorable factors  application of sfas no 
requires a valuation allowance for any net deferred tax assets when a company has cumulative financial accounting losses  excluding unusual items  over several years 
accordingly  after consideration of these factors  in  we provided a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  which totaled million at year end 
the valuation allowance will be reversed to income in future periods to the extent that the related deferred tax assets are realized as a reduction of taxes otherwise payable on any future earnings or a portion or all of the valuation allowance is otherwise no longer required 
because provisions in the tax law allow us to receive a carryback refund for taxable losses incurred in  in determining the amount of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance we had to estimate the current tax deductibility of certain costs and charges 
these estimates are subject to change 
any differences between these current estimates and actual values determined during the preparation of the income tax returns will result in a change to the valuation allowance which will be reflected in results of operations next year 
the company expects to receive income tax refunds of approximately million  of which approximately million results from net operating losses on its federal income tax return which can be carried back to prior years 
the net operating loss includes tax deductions related to the closure and liquidation of certain legal entities in connection with the company s restructuring actions in the company expects to file its federal income tax return in april  and expects to receive the refund in may or june due to the size of the tax refund  the company expects that its federal tax return will by audited by the internal revenue service 
the precise amount of the refund or the timing of its receipt is not certain 
the outcome of the expected audit of the federal tax return is not possible to predict 
the company has 
table of contents evaluated the need for tax reserves and  based on current and prior year tax filings  in increased its tax reserves by recording a million allowance for tax adjustments 
property  plant and equipment the recoverability of long lived assets is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable  primarily based on estimated selling prices  appraised value or projected undiscounted cash flows 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted for estimated current industry trends  the economy and operating conditions 
additionally  we use estimates of fair market values to establish impairment reserves for permanently closed facilities that are held for sale 
a significant change in these estimates and assumptions could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
reserves for self insured risks the company is self insured for a significant portion of its workers compensation  general and products  auto liability  health and property insurance 
under our current self insurance programs  we are generally responsible for up to  per claim for workers compensation and automobile liability claims  up to million per claim for product liability and general liability claims and up to million per claim for property insurance claims including business interruption losses 
we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers to minimize our risks related to catastrophic claims 
under our current self insurance program we are responsible for of health insurance claims 
estimated insurance costs are accrued for incurred claims and claims incurred but not yet reported 
factors considered in estimating our insurance reserves are the nature of outstanding claims including the severity of the claims  estimated costs to settle existing claims  loss history  and inflation  as well as estimates provided by the company s outside insurance broker and carrier  which historically have been greater than the company s own estimates 
during the third quarter ended september   the company recorded a pretax charge of million to increase its self insurance reserves based on an actuarial study completed by an independent third party during the third quarter 
a significant change in the factors described above could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
warranty reserves champion s manufacturing operations provide the retail homebuyer with a month warranty 
estimated warranty costs are accrued as cost of sales at the time the manufacturing segment records the sale 
our warranty reserve is based on estimates of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on homes sold by the manufacturing operations as of the balance sheet date 
factors used to calculate the warranty obligation are the estimated number of homes still under warranty  including homes in retailer inventories and homes purchased by consumers still within the month warranty period  and the historical average costs incurred to service a home 
a significant change in these factors could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
wholesale repurchase reserves the majority of the company s manufacturing sales to independent retailers are made pursuant to repurchase agreements 
potential losses under repurchase obligations are determined by calculating the difference between the repurchase price and the estimated net resale value of the homes 
probable losses under repurchase agreements are accrued based on the historical number of homes repurchased  the cost of such repurchases and the historical losses incurred as well as the current inventory levels held at champion s independent retailers 
in addition  the company monitors the risks associated with its independent retailers and considers these risks in its evaluation of the wholesale repurchase reserves 
a significant change in any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 

table of contents impact of inflation inflation has not had a material effect on champion s operations during the last three years 
commodity prices  including lumber  fluctuate  however  during periods of rising commodity prices the company has been able to pass the increased costs to its customers in the form of surcharges and base price increases 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  which no longer requires extinguishment of debt to be characterized as an extraordinary gain 
as a result of the company s adoption in of sfas  gains on debt retirement totaling million are included in the company s operating results for the year ended december  rather than as an extraordinary gain as previously required under sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which requires recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred rather than recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan as currently required in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption by the company of sfas no 
at the beginning of fiscal will impact the manner in which the company reports certain restructuring activities  including lease termination costs  employee severance and other exit activities 
these charges will generally be recognized when the liability is incurred 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of sfas no 
 which provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  statement no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the adoption by the company of sfas no 
in the first quarter of will impact our interim disclosure requirements and will require the company to choose among alternative implementation methods if the company were to adopt sfas no 
and change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation clarifies the requirement for recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of the guarantee  based on the fair value of the non contingent obligation to perform 
this interpretation must be applied prospectively to guarantees entered into or modified after december  accordingly  the company will recognize the fair value of guarantees issued beginning in these amounts are expected to be insignificant 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
under previous practice  entities were included in consolidated financial statements generally based on controlling voting interests or in other special situations 
under this interpretation  certain previously unconsolidated entities often referred to as special purpose entities will be included in the consolidated financial statements of the primary beneficiary as a result of non voting financial interests which are established through contractual or other means 
for variable interest entities created after january   this interpretation is effective immediately 
for any pre existing variable interest entities  this interpretation is effective beginning with the company s fiscal third quarter 
we continue to examine this new literature but believe our accounting for our special purpose entity is already in compliance with this interpretation 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s floor plan borrowings are subject to interest primarily based on the us prime interest rate  although certain of the floor plan borrowings are subject to a minimum rate of interest which is greater than the current prime rate 
without consideration of the minimum rate of interest on certain of the floor plan borrowings  a basis point increase in the prime rate would result in additional annual interest cost of approximately million  assuming average floor plan borrowings of million  the amount of outstanding borrowings at december  in addition  the company has obligations under industrial revenue bonds that are subject to variable interest rates tied to short term tax exempt rate indices which averaged in a basis point increase in this interest rate would result in additional annual interest cost of approximately million  based on the million of debt outstanding under industrial revenue bonds at december  adverse changes in interest rates or in the asset backed securitization or whole loan sale markets may cause declines in the fair market value of our consumer loans receivable 
based on current uncertainties in the asset backed securitization market and the limited market that currently exists for whole loan sales transactions  we believe that at december   the fair value of our consumer loans receivable could be lower than our carrying value by approximately  or million
