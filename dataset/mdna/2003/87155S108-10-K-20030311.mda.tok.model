these statements typically may be identified by the use of forward looking words or phrases such as believe  expect  intend  anticipate  should  planned  estimated  and potential  among others 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on our current expectations  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for such forward looking statements 
in order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  we note that a variety of factors could cause actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in such forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations  performance  development  and results of our businesses include but are not limited to market acceptance of our products and services  uncertainties relating to the pace  quality or number of discoveries of new materials  the dependence on collaborators to successfully commercialize products  uncertainties of patent protection and litigation  future growth strategy  general economic conditions in the united states and in major european and asian markets  exposure to risks associated with export sales and operations  natural disasters  power failures and other disasters  and other factors that might be described from time to time in our periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission and include those set forth in this annual report on form k as factors affecting future results and other risk factors 
all percentage amounts and ratios were calculated using the underlying data in thousands 
operating results for the year ended december   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for future fiscal years 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the notes to those financial statements that are included in item of part ii of this form k 
overview to date  our revenues and cash flows from operations have come from research collaborations with large chemical  life science and electronics companies  sale of instruments  and licensing of intellectual property  materials and software  and government grants 
approximately leading chemical  life science and electronics companies are among our base of worldwide partners  customers and licensees 
we expect that our cash flows and revenue for will be comprised in large part of payments to be made and revenue to be earned under research and development collaborations together with product revenue from our discovery tools business and license fees from our intellectual property and materials licensing business 
we have invested heavily in establishing the technology  instrumentation and informatics necessary to pursue high throughput discovery of materials 
these materials include catalysts to manufacture commodity chemicals and polyolefins  polymers and phosphors for life science and industrial applications  and specialized materials for electronics applications 
despite challenges in the overall business climate  we generated revenues of million  an increase of over we ended the year with net income of million  or per share on a diluted basis 
in addition  we generated positive cash flow  ending the year with million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
our revenue increased from million in to million in to million in operating expenses increased from million in to million in to million in our total headcount increased from employees at the end of and to employees at the end of to employees at the end of as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
we may incur additional operating losses as we continue to expand staffing  equipment and facilities 
see factors affecting future results 

table of contents we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development to enhance our technologies  including for the development of new instruments and software 
in addition  our strategy is to expand our operations and to continue to build our research and development  business development and marketing efforts 
critical accounting policies symyx financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
note to the consolidated financial statements included under item in this annual report  describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
preparing financial statements and related disclosures requires management to exercise judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  revenue recognition  establishing the warranty expense accrual  establishing slow moving  obsolete and excess inventory reserves  determining when technical feasibility for our software products has been achieved and accounting for income taxes 
the following critical accounting policies  among others  are impacted significantly by judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
source of revenues and revenue recognition policy service revenue consists of research and development funding received from collaborative partners as well as government grants received for proprietary materials research 
product revenue consists of payments from customers for discovery tools systems and consumables 
royalties and license fees include fees for licensing of our intellectual property  proprietary materials and technology license payments and royalties on laboratory instruments and software sold under license by third parties 
we recognize revenue from research collaboration agreements and government grants as earned upon performance of the services specified in the agreements 
payments received that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as revenue as the performance requirements are fulfilled 
as of december   we had deferred revenues of approximately million  compared with million at december  the terms of our collaboration agreements generally require us to perform minimum levels of research 
we recognize revenue from the sale of discovery tools  and all related costs of products sold are expensed  once customer acceptance has been achieved 
a warranty expense accrual is established at the time of customer acceptance 
if there are extended payment terms  we recognize product revenue as these payments become due 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms extending beyond months not to be fixed or determinable 
accordingly  the cost of products sold as a percentage of product revenue will fluctuate from one period to the next based on the timing of when extended payments are due as well as the mix of products sold 
we recognize license fee revenues for licenses to our intellectual property when earned under the terms of the agreements 
generally  revenue is recognized upon transfer of the license unless we have continuing obligations for which fair value cannot be established  in which case the revenue is recognized over the period of the obligation 
if there are extended payment terms  we recognize license fee revenue as these payments become due 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms extending beyond months not to be fixed or determinable 
in certain licensing arrangements there is provision for a variable fee as well as a non refundable minimum amount 
in such arrangements  the amount of the non refundable minimum guarantee is recognized upon transfer of the license unless we have continuing obligations for which fair value cannot be established and the amount of the variable fee in excess of the guaranteed minimum is recognized as revenue when it is fixed and determinable 
we recognize royalty revenues based on reported sales by third party licensees of products containing our materials  software and intellectual property 

table of contents our sources of potential revenue for the next several years are likely to be payments under existing and possible future collaborative arrangements  royalties from our partners based on revenues received from any products commercialized under those agreements  sales of discovery tools  other instruments and associated services  and licensing of software and intellectual property 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our revenue recognition policies 
inventories we carry our inventories at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a specific identification basis 
we apply judgment in determining the provisions for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience and anticipated product demand 
warranty expense accrual a warranty expense accrual is established at the time of customer acceptance of a discovery tool system and is included as a cost of product sold 
management is required to exercise judgment in establishing the appropriate level of warranty expense accrual for each discovery tool system delivered 
the actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have a material unfavorable impact on us if system failures or the costs to repair systems are greater than our estimates 
research and development costs symyx accounts for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements  including sfas  accounting for research and development costs  and sfas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
sfas specifies that costs incurred internally in creating a computer software product should be charged to expense when incurred as research and development until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
once technological feasibility is established  all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when the technological feasibility of a product is established 
symyx has determined that technological feasibility for its software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing 
costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material  and accordingly  the company expenses all research and development costs when incurred 
accounting for income taxes income taxes have been provided using the liability method 
our effective tax rate for fiscal year is based on our projection of the estimated future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
a deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse 
we provide a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets unless  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
establishing this valuation allowance involves significant judgment  since we have a limited history of profitability and the period over which the potential future benefit from the deferred tax assets may be realized is quite long 
employee stock options we generally grant stock options to our employees for a fixed number of shares with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares on the date of grant 
as allowed under the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  we have 
table of contents elected to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations in accounting for stock awards to employees 
accordingly  no compensation expense is recognized in our financial statements in connection with stock options granted to employees with exercise prices not less than fair value 
deferred compensation for options granted to employees is determined as the difference between the deemed fair market value of the company s common stock on the date options were granted and the exercise price 
deferred compensation deferred compensation for options granted to employees has been determined as the difference between the deemed fair market value of our common stock on the date options were granted and the exercise price 
deferred compensation for options granted to consultants has been determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
as the fair value of the equity instruments issued 
deferred compensation for options granted to consultants is periodically remeasured as the underlying options vest 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and consultants  prior to our initial public offering in we recorded deferred stock compensation of approximately million 
this amount was initially recorded as a component of stockholders equity and is being amortized by charges to operations over the vesting period of the underlying options using the graded vesting method 
we recorded amortization of deferred compensation of approximately  in   in  and  in the amortization expense relates to options awarded to employees in all operating expense categories

results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues our total revenue in was million  an increase of from million in this increase was due to the growth in our discovery tools business which generated million of revenue in up from million in our revenue from research collaborations decreased from million in to million in due mainly to the expiration of a number of technology access fees in and the expiration and non renewal of other contracts due largely to budget constraints being faced by our collaborative partners 
exxonmobil chemical company  eli lilly and the dow chemical company  accounted for   and  respectively  of total revenue for the year ended december  exxonmobil chemical company  the dow chemical company and bayer accounted for   and  respectively  of revenue for the same period in 
table of contents we segregate revenue by industry collaborations  discovery tools and licensing of patents and materials 
industry collaborations revenue is further segregated into four categories for purposes of internal management reporting chemicals  electronic materials  life sciences and industrial polymers 
years ended december  in thousands industry collaborations chemicals electronic materials life science industrial polymers discovery tools licensing of patents and materials total industry collaboration revenue the decrease in chemicals revenue in was largely attributable to the conclusion of the technology access fees paid under the bayer and dow collaboration contracts and recognized over the life of those contracts and a reduction in the level of funding received from dow and celanese in the reduction in funding received in chemicals due to the end of the bayer collaboration in december was offset by the increase in funding received under the exxonmobil collaboration in the increase in electronic materials revenue in was mainly attributable to a research collaboration with an undisclosed partner 
the decrease in life science revenue in resulted primarily from the conclusion of the applied biosystems collaboration at december  and the conclusion of the funding received from merck under the polymorph systems development collaboration during  partially offset by the addition of a number of new smaller collaborations 
the decrease in industrial polymers revenue in resulted primarily from the expiration of the basf and ici collaborations in service revenue from research collaborations exceeded research and development costs for the years ended december  and primarily because of continued research contract profitability 
discovery tools revenue the increase in discovery tools revenue in was attributable mainly to the shipment of discovery tools polymorph systems to merck and eli lilly and discovery tools solubility systems to merck  lilly and amgen during we also shipped discovery tools systems to north dakota state university  an unnamed customer and dow chemical company in discovery tools revenue included  of product sales   of service revenues  and  of software license revenue for the year ended december  and  of product sales and  of software license revenue for the year ended december  licensing of patents and materials the increase in licensing revenue in was due to the licensing of patents to general electric  bayer and an undisclosed licensee  together with a fully paid up license fee received from argonaut technologies  inc licensing revenue for the year ended december  included advance royalty payments received under the abi collaboration that expired on december  
table of contents cost of products sold cost of products sold was million  or of product sales revenue for the year ended december   compared to million  or of product sales revenue for the year ended december  the decrease in the cost of products sold was due to the change in the product mix shipped in the respective years 
we have had limited sales of discovery tools systems and consumables to date  and the cost of products sold is expected to fluctuate from period to period and will be driven by the variability of product mix and sales volumes in each period 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  facility costs  supplies  and depreciation of facilities and laboratory equipment 
the table below indicates the major collaborative partners  defined as those contributing greater than of collaborative research revenue in  for whom symyx conducted research and development  together with the primary focus of the collaborations and the date upon which the current contract ends 
contracts may only be extended by mutual agreement between symyx and the collaborative partner 
current research partner contract ends primary focus of collaborative efforts exxonmobil production of olefins dow chemical polyolefins and pharmaceutical intermediates we do not track fully burdened research and development costs or capital expenditures by project 
however  we estimate based on full time equivalent fte effort  that approximately of research development efforts in were undertaken for collaborative projects funded by our partners  and approximately of research effort was on our own internally funded research including development costs related to our discovery tools business 
this compares with approximately of research development efforts being undertaken for collaborative projects funded by our partners  and approximately of research effort on our own internally funded research including development costs related to our discovery tools business during due to the nature of our research and our dependence on our collaborative partners to commercialize the results of the research  we cannot predict with any certainty whether any particular collaboration or research effort will ultimately result in a commercial product and therefore whether we will achieve future milestones or royalty payments under our various collaborations 
research and development expenses in were million  compared with million in  an increase of  or 
the increase in was due primarily to increases in salaries and other personnel related costs  to support our additional collaborative and internal research efforts and development of discovery tools systems 
research and development expenses represented of total revenues in and of total revenues in the decrease as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the increase in product sales revenue from our discovery tools business 
our core businesses are research to discover new materials  the sale of instruments and licensing of related software and licensing of intellectual property and materials discovered in our collaborative and internal research programs 
accordingly  we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development  and we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars 
sales  general and administrative expenses our sales  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for business development  legal  general management  finance and human resources  as well as payments of commissions to our sales agents and professional expenses  such as legal and accounting 
sales  general and administrative expenses in were million  compared with million in  an increase of million or 
these increases were primarily due to the addition of a number of business development staff and their 
table of contents associated costs to manage and support our growth  increased salaries and benefit costs and the payments of commissions on the sales of discovery tool systems in japan and on the licensing of intellectual property 
sales  general and administrative expenses represented of total revenues in and of total revenues in we expect that our sales  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts as we continue to expand our business development and administrative staff  support existing and expanded laboratory and engineering facilities  and incur escalating insurance and other administrative costs 
net interest income expense net interest income expense represents interest income earned on our cash and available for sale securities net of interest expense on equipment financing loans 
interest income was million in  compared with million in this decrease was due to lower interest rates in amounts owed under equipment financing loans used to partially fund our initial acquisition of equipment were fully repaid at december   resulting in interest expense decreasing to  in from  in provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax expense of million in and million in the effective tax rate was for fiscal year and for fiscal year the increase in our effective tax rate in is due to the fact that we had largely utilized our net operating loss carryforwards as of december  we do not have a sufficient history of profitability to fully benefit all our deferred tax assets at this time 
the largest component of our unbenefited deferred tax assets arises because our depreciation expense for accounting purposes is substantially higher than our tax depreciation expense 
until we have a more established history of profitability  we will not be sufficiently confident of receiving the full benefit of these future income tax deductions 
as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of approximately million 
our net deferred tax assets primarily relate to revenue that has been recognized for income tax purposes but deferred for financial reporting purposes together with reserves and accruals that have been recognized for financial reporting purposes but not for income tax purposes 
at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  the net operating loss carryforwards will expire in  if not utilized 
the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets includes approximately  attributable to stock option deductions  the benefit of which will be credited to stockholders equity upon realization 
utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues our total revenues in was million  an increased of from million in this increase was due mainly to the growth in our discovery tools business which generated million of revenue in up from million in the remainder of the increase in revenue was attributable to the addition of new and expanded research collaborations with companies in the chemicals industry 

table of contents applied biosystems  bayer  celanese  exxonmobil and the dow chemical company accounted for    and of total revenue for the months ended december   and    and of revenue for the same period in years ended december  in thousands industry collaborations chemicals electronic materials life science industrial polymers discovery tools licensing of patents and materials total industry collaboration revenue the increase in industry collaboration revenue for the year ended december  compared to was largely attributable to new research collaborations initiated with chemical companies such as exxonmobil and life science companies such as merck 
service revenue from research collaborations exceeded research and development costs for the year ended december  primarily because of increasing research contract profitability 
the excess of research and development costs over research revenue during the year ended december  was primarily due to the research costs associated with internal projects in our proprietary materials business and the development costs associated with the initiation of our discovery tools business 
discovery tools revenue the increase in discovery tools revenue for the year ended december  compared to was attributable mainly to the shipment of a discovery tools polyolefins system to exxonmobil chemical company  a discovery tools polymerization system to sumitomo  a discovery tools polymerization system to girsa and a discovery tools rapidlgpc system to girsa 
discovery tools revenue included  of product sales and  of software license revenue for the year ended december  licensing of patents and materials the increase in licensing revenue for the year ended december  compared to was due to the licensing fee received from zeton and argonaut technologies  inc and licensing of intellectual property to bayer 
cost of products sold cost of products sold was  or of product sales revenue for the year ended december   compared to million  or of product sales revenue for the year ended december  the increase in cost of products sold in the year ended december  was largely attributable to the discovery tools polyolefins systems delivered to exxonmobil chemical company  the discovery tools rapidlgpc system delivered to girsa and the discovery tools polymerization systems delivered to both girsa and sumitomo chemical company  ltd

research and development expenses in were million  compared with million in  an increase of million or 
the increase in was due primarily to increases in salaries and other personnel related costs  facilities costs and chemical and scientific supplies costs to support our additional collaborative and internal research efforts 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in the use of consultants  outside research services and the deferred compensation charge 
research and development expenses represented of total revenues in and of total revenues in the decrease as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to revenue increases associated with the addition of significant contracts and a reduction in outside research and consultant costs in our core businesses are research to discover new materials and the sale of instruments and related software licenses

table of contents do not believe there will be a material effect upon our financial condition or results from operations from the adoption of the provisions of fin liquidity and capital resources this section discusses the effects of the changes in our balance sheets  cash flows  and commitments on our liquidity and capital resources 
balance sheet and cash flows we had positive cash flow for the year ended december  and finished the year with cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of approximately million  an increase of million from december  in prior years  we had financed our operations primarily through research and development funding from collaborative partners  net proceeds from our initial public offering of million and  prior to the initial public offering  private placements of preferred stock totaling million  and to a lesser extent  equipment financing loans 
during  we completely paid off the remaining million of debt that was incurred to fund capital expenditures in the early stages of operation 
as of december   symyx had no long term liabilities 
our operating activities provided million  million and million of cash in  and  respectively 
the sources of cash for the three years were primarily the receipt of research and development funding from collaborative partners and revenue from product sales and intellectual property licensing  partially offset by operating expenses 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the fluctuations from period to period are due primarily to the timing of purchases  sales and maturity securities and purchases of property and equipment 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in the purchase of property and equipment to support our expanding operations 
financing activities provided cash of million in and used cash of million and  in and  respectively 
these amounts are primarily the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and sale of stock under the employee share purchase plan in each of the three years  offset by partial repayments of equipment and leasehold improvement loan financing in each of and the fluctuations from year to year are due primarily to the fact that during the fourth quarter of we repaid all remaining amounts outstanding under loan financings 
current liabilities decreased by approximately million at december  as compared to december  the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in deferred revenue and income tax payable partially offset by an increase in the warranty reserve at december  deferred revenue decreased at december  as compared to december  due to the timing of the receipt of advance deposits for discovery tools systems 
deferred revenue at december  included a significant deposit toward a discovery tools polymorph system that was delivered to the customer in the final quarter of income taxes payable decreased at december  compared to december  as the benefit relating to stock option deductions was reclassified from income taxes payable to equity 
our warranty expense accrual at december  is higher than december   reflecting an increase in our installed base of discovery tools systems subject to warranty 
backlog as of december   our customers have contractually committed to future funding of approximately million for the purchase by customers of discovery tools systems  licenses to our intellectual property and for research and development with existing collaborative partners  excluding milestone payments which are contingent upon the success of the research 

table of contents commitments as of december  and  our principal commitments were million and million  respectively 
principal commitments consisted of our obligations under operating leases 
we will satisfy these obligations as they become due over the next eight years 
future commitments under the operating leases for our facilities are as follows in thousands years ending december  thereafter in march  we exercised our option to purchase for million the land and building at central expressway  santa clara  ca which houses our head office 
as of december   we have purchase commitments for inventory of approximately  we believe that our current cash  available for sale securities balances and the cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures  investment requirements  stock repurchases and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations for at least the coming year 
nonetheless  we may raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot assure you that additional funding  if sought  will be available on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements may require us to relinquish our rights to some of our technologies or products 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies 
contingencies we are a party to a legal proceeding that has arisen in the ordinary course of business see item legal proceedings 
while the outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty  management does not expect this matter to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results from operations or cash flows 
we carry insurance with coverages and coverage limits that we believe to be adequate 
although there can be no assurance that such insurance is sufficient to protect us against all contingencies  management believes that our insurance protection is reasonable in view of the nature and scope of our operations 
off balance sheet financing and related party transactions symyx has not entered into any off balance sheet financing arrangements and has not established any special purpose entities as of december  symyx has not guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities or entered into any options on non financial assets
