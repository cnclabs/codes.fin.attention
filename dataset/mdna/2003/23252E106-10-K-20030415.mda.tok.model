on december   the credit agreement was amended and restated in full 
the restated credit agreement  among other things  extended the maturity date of the facility to december   restructured the indebtedness  reduced the monthly principal payments  amended the financial covenants  and waived all then existing defaults 
the restated credit agreement provided for term loans with an initial balance of  a revolving loan availability equal to the lesser of  or an amount determined by reference to a borrowing base  and a letter of credit facility of up to  in february  a letter of credit under the letter of credit facility was utilized to retire an outstanding promissory note of  pursuant to the terms of the restated credit agreement  the letter of credit facility was reduced by  and replaced by an additional term loan in the same amount

critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgements  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  realizability of inventory  reserve for warranty obligations  legal matters  impairment of goodwill  and valuation of deferred tax assets 
management bases its estimates and judgements on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  which could materially impact the company s results of operations and financial position 
these critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the company s audit committee 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
management performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
management continuously monitors collections and payments from customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
if the financial condition of a specific customer or the company s general customer base were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
realizability of inventory 
the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and historical usage  after considering the impact of new products 
if actual market conditions and product demand are less favorable than projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
warranty reserve 
since january   all products are warranted for one year for labor and ten years for structural frames 
warranty periods for parts range from one to three years depending on the part and the type of equipment 
prior to december   the company generally provided a three year warranty on cardiovascular products 
a warranty liability is recorded at the time of product sale based on estimates that are developed from historical information and certain assumptions about future events 
future warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates  usage and service costs incurred in addressing warranty claims 
these factors are impacted by the level of new product introductions and the mix of equipment sold to the commercial and consumer markets 
if actual warranty costs differ from the estimates  adjustments to the warranty liability would be required 
legal matters 
the company has recorded a reserve related to certain legal matters for which it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the range of such loss can be determined 
with respect to other matters  management has concluded that a loss is only possible or remote and  therefore  no liability is recorded 
in addition  there are certain gain contingencies for which the company has not recorded an asset because realization is not considered probable as of the balance sheet date 
as additional information becomes available  the company will continue to assess whether losses from legal matters are probable  possible or remote  the adequacy of accruals for probable loss contingencies and the status of gain contingencies 
impairment of goodwill 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  management is required to make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine whether the fair value of the business supports the carrying value of goodwill and net operating assets 
this analysis includes assumptions and estimates about future sales  costs  working capital  capital expenditures  and cost of capital 
if these assumptions and estimates change in the future  the company may be required to record an impairment charge related to goodwill 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
the company established  during the year ended december   a valuation allowance of  against the carrying value of its deferred income tax assets 
approximately  of future taxable income is needed prior to the expiration of the net operating losses to fully realize the company s deferred tax assets 
if the estimates and related assumptions relating to the likely utilization of the deferred tax asset change in the future  the valuation allowance may change accordingly

addresses the accounting and reporting of expenses related to restructurings initiated after  and applies to costs associated with an exit activity including a restructuring or with a disposal of long lived assets 
those activities can include eliminating or reducing product lines  terminating employees and contracts  and relocating plant facilities or personnel

 fin guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that the guarantor recognize  at the inception of certain guarantees  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing such guarantees 
fin also requires additional disclosure about the guarantor s obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  and the disclosure requirements are effective after december   and are included above under accrued warranty obligations and in note in december  the fasb issued sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the company s debt portfolio  including an interest rate swap agreement  as of december  is comprised of debt denominated in us dollars 
the company has both fixed and variable rate debt 
changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable portion of the company s debt portfolio 
a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial position of the company  but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial position 
at december  and  the company had fixed rate debt with a book value of  and  respectively 
the company believes that book value approximates fair value for this debt 
the sensitivity analysis related to the fixed portion of the company s debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous basis point move in interest rates from their levels at december   with all other variables held constant 
the company does not believe that a basis point change in market rates would result in a material impact on the net financial position of the company because the difference between market rates and the fixed rate is not significant over the short remaining term of the fixed rate debt 
at december  and  the company had variable rate debt with a book value of  and  respectively 
a basis point change in interest rates would impact interest expense by  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively

at december   the notional amount of the interest rate swap was  at december   the company received interest at a rate of and paid interest at a rate of under the agreement and the fair value of the swap was a  liability
