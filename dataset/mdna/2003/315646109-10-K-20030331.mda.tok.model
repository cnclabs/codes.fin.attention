item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business we are a leading producer of specialty fiber based materials for industrial and consumer needs worldwide  with production facilities in the u 
s and europe 
our versatile manufacturing capabilities comprising papermaking  synthetic nonwoven web technology  saturating  coating and other finishing processes generate products sold in roll or sheet form 
our product line includes specialty papers  high density pressboards  treated cloth  nonwoven materials that may offer the performance or appearance of cloth or advanced fiber based materials  latex saturated papers with the feel of leather or other durable materials  and composite materials 
we sell our base materials to fill the needs of a wide variety of markets and customers  who are primarily manufacturers of finished products or components 
our customers may have very technical needs or high aesthetic demands  or a combination of both  for the products we make for them 
formed as an independent company in  we subsequently went public in since  we have completed six acquisitions  streamlined our operations and sold technology that we no longer needed to achieve our growth plans 
through strong technical capabilities  innovation and a service orientation  we believe we hold leadership positions in most of our primary markets 
as a result of these acquisitions  divestitures and changes in our operations undertaken since  the converting side of our business has increased in significance compared with our papermaking production 
important factors and trends we have identified several important factors that affect our operating results the overall state of the global economy  particularly regions accounting for most of our sales us  europe and asia the extent to which our markets are mature or faster growing the majority of our markets are mature and their growth tends to correlate with growth in gross domestic product gdp 
some markets are shrinking slowly due to substitution of alternate base materials such as plastics or films or due to shifts in demand for our customers products such as migration from data binders to ring binders or from books to electronic technologies certain markets offer higher growth for us due to our ability to create innovative products that have growing appeal versus traditional media eg fire retardant filter media for transportation applications or nonwoven wallcovering versus paper or vinyl based wallcovering the cost of key raw materials  particularly wood pulp  and to a lesser extent  latex  and the degree to which we are able to pass through cost increases to our customers the efficiency levels of our manufacturing operations  which reflect our endeavors to streamline operations  which may negatively influence short term efficiencies capacity utilization levels  which are clearly tied to fluctuations in sales volumes the quality  service and technical capabilities we offer our current and prospective customers our business has experienced numerous changes  the dynamics of which vary by market 
however  in general  we can identify a number of trends that relate to many of our markets  such as industry consolidation through mergers and acquisitions higher concentration among our manufacturing customers consolidation among distributors  and their ownership relationships with manufacturers retail consolidation producing fewer  more dominant retailers  such as office product superstores  which tend to focus on reducing prices and narrowing the range of products offered increasing emphasis on price as the dominant component of the purchasing equation  often coupled with general pricing pressure  particularly when economic conditions are weak some substitution of lower cost or higher performance alternate materials or technologies changes in demand for products or categories of products which can either benefit us  such as the growth in nonwoven wallcovering in europe at the expense of paint and traditional paper wallcoverings  or can hurt us  as with the decline of data binders due to growth of laser printed output versus wide format computer paper capacity growth relative to demand  both throughout the paper industry and especially in certain of our markets  resulting in lower capacity utilization  more aggressive competition and lower margins 
capacity is currently tight in a few of our markets  but we believe those situations are likely to stabilize within the next few years  which could reduce pricing levels in short  these trends have tended to diminish the value of our historic customer relationships and necessitate regular innovations in technology  service  performance and our cost structure to maintain and develop new business opportunities 
these overall trends have impacted  or are expected to impact  our results as follows lower than expected sales as gains of business from customers have been offset by losses of certain types of business  such as business taken in house by customers lower margins  particularly in our north american operations higher revenues and earnings in our german operations in total  earnings during and that did not achieve targeted results  primarily due to weak sales related to economic conditions  delays in our facility consolidation  and short term operating inefficiencies as we undertook an extensive consolidation of our operations our principal concerns relate to our ability to realize the expected cost savings related to our site closures and facility consolidations 
while some of these savings have been realized  they have been achieved more slowly than expected due to offsetting inefficiencies that we believe are short term in nature 
some consolidation activity was delayed due to the time necessary to effectively implement the transfers  while other activity was delayed in order to postpone associated capital spending given uncertain economic conditions our ability to pass through raw material cost increases to our customers  such as in wood pulp or latex  particularly in recessionary times challenges associated with achieving sales growth  including finding new high growth  high margin product lines while offsetting the effects of market shrinkage or slow growth in the mature markets in which we compete 
given our already strong market positions  further market share gains can be difficult to obtain 
our ability to manufacture our product lines while achieving necessary efficiency levels on our paper machines in our new jersey operations our ability to achieve improved earnings performance in north america  returning to our historical levels of earnings growth continuing to attract high potential  effective employees at all levels of the organization we expect to make continued improvements to our cost structure as we complete our facility consolidations and reach targeted efficiency improvements in our new jersey operations 
it is difficult to gauge the pace of our progress in this regard  but we currently anticipate completing our consolidation by year end  having achieved meaningful improvements in efficiencies before that point 
acquisitions  divestitures and consolidations during our history as an independent company  we have undertaken a series of acquisitions  divestitures and consolidations designed to broaden and deepen our product and market capabilities  lower our manufacturing costs  lessen our dependence on certain raw materials and improve our operational flexibility 
we have acquired and integrated six major businesses since  consolidated redundant facilities and grown our revenues from million in to million in the following acquisitions  divestitures and consolidations were instrumental in pursuing our objectives 
effective january   we acquired steinbeis gessner gmbh  referred to as gessner  for a purchase price of million 
gessner  headquartered near munich  germany  is a leading producer of specialty fiber based materials sold into the filtration  technical specialties and durable specialties markets 
gessner s sales for were million 
to finance this acquisition  we sold  shares of common stock on december  and  shares on january  for aggregate gross proceeds of million and net proceeds to us of approximately million 
to complete the financing of the gessner acquisition  we also borrowed million from bayerische vereinsbank in munich  germany on january  this term loan was repaid on april  on november   we announced that we planned to cease operations at our beaver falls  new york  facility 
the new york facility was closed on january  we booked a million pre tax charge related to the closure of this facility in the fourth quarter of effective august   we acquired papierfabrik lahnstein gmbh  a leading european manufacturer of specialty papers and nonwoven materials used for wallcoverings  security papers  self adhesive labels and flooring overlay 
lahnstein s annual sales at that time were approximately million 
the purchase price for the acquisition was approximately million and was financed with million of cash reserves and million in german bank debt 
this debt was repaid on april  on august   we initiated a project to install a new paper machine at our warren glen  new jersey  facility 
we also made plans to consolidate operations from our hughesville  new jersey facility to warren glen 
in connection with this planned consolidation  we recorded facility closure costs of million 
in we also increased closure expenses for our previously closed facilities by million 
in facility closure expenses were decreased by million 
on september   we terminated our sale leaseback facility with the cit group  and repurchased the assets at our brattleboro  vermont  mill 
concurrently  we expanded our revolving credit facility with cit from million to million 
on an annualized basis  this transaction reduced lease expense by million and increased depreciation expense by million 
due to this cost structure reduction  inventory valuation was reduced by million 
we also incurred refinancing fees of million  which are being amortized over the term of the agreement 
on september   we entered into an agreement with ahlstrom paper group to sell certain filter media production technology and equipment and a portion of the filter media volume manufactured at the richmond  virginia  facility 
we completed the transfer of the remaining richmond volume to other fibermark facilities and closed the richmond facility in june as of december   we recorded million in closure charges and million revenue from the sale of technology 
on april   we acquired rexam dsi for a purchase price of million 
dsi is a leading global manufacturer of specialty decorative covering materials serving the publishing  stationery and premium packaging markets  with a particular focus on latex saturated paper products 
dsi s sales for were million for the full year  of which fibermark realized million during our partial year of ownership 
the acquisition was financed with the issuance of million of senior notes due the balance of the senior notes was used to repay existing indebtedness and for financing and acquisition fees 
on august   we reached a decision to retain operations at the hughesville  new jersey  facility and reversed million of facility closure expense previously recorded in decrease of million and million 
on december   we sold the beaver falls  new york  facility to ltx corporation 
proceeds net of expenses were million 
we also reversed million of facility closure expense for property  plant and equipment to be retained 
during the year  we ceased operations at our fitchburg  massachusetts  facility 
we recorded a related charge of million in in  facility closure expenses were decreased by million 
also during the year  we sold the balance of our us engine filter media business and equipment to ahlstrom corporation and ceased operations at our rochester  michigan  facility in related facility closure charges of million were recorded in in  facility closure expenses were decreased by million 
proceeds related to this sale of technology were million  net of expenses in on december   we concluded a series of transactions with ahlstrom corp 
we sold most of our north american industrial filter media business  representing million in annual sales  as well as our german disposable nonwoven tablecloth business  representing million in annual sales 
simultaneously  we purchased a portion of ahlstrom s vacuum bag filter media business  representing million in annual vacuum bag filter media sales 
we also sold million in equipment 
in consideration  we received cash proceeds of million at the time of the transaction and another million during the first quarter of principal financial metrics earnings per share is the primary financial metric that we use to evaluate our financial results  as well as to assess senior manager performance and bonus compensation 
we also use the following metrics to evaluate our financial results compound annual growth rate of earnings per share earnings before interest and taxes  depreciation and amortization commonly referred to as ebitda compound sales growth free cash flow return on capital operating income margin or to place our financial results in context leverage ratio  defined as net debt to total capitalization market to book value book value per share operating data as a percentage of sales the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net sales 
net sales cost of sales gross profit general and administrative expenses facility closure sale of technology goodwill impairment income loss from operations other expense  net interest expense  net of interest income income loss before income taxes net effect of income taxes extraordinary item net of income tax benefit net income loss year ended december  compared with year ended december  for the year ended december  net sales were million in compared with million in  a increase 
sales from german operations sales from german operations increased to million in from million in as described below  this improvement was primarily related to strength in automotive and other transportation related filter media  new business in saturated tape base  market growth in nonwoven wallcovering and a stronger euro  on average  in compared with the estimated effect of the stronger euro on sales was million 
german operations filter media sales grew  or million  due to strong market conditions  particularly in transportation 
additionally  we have grown our fire retardant filter media business for car  truck and rail applications  due  we believe  to our strong quality and innovative product line 
vacuum bag filter media sales were essentially unchanged in compared with technical specialties sales for german operations increased  or million  primarily due to stronger sales at lahnstein  largely driven by market growth in nonwoven wallcoverings 
additionally  sales in the much smaller latex treated abrasive backing material product family used in sandpaper grew due to comparable market growth 
durable specialties sales for german operations  consisting of raw and saturated tape base  increased  or million 
a large portion of this growth was due to sales gains with a relatively new customer in taiwan that is selling to the growing pacific rim market  the balance was due to modest improvement in business conditions worldwide 
sales from north american operations sales in our north american operations were million in versus million for the prior year  a decline 
as described below  sales from north american operations were influenced by general economic weakness  and declined by approximately million due to the divestiture of the company s us engine filtration business and by approximately million due to the loss of a large masking tape base customer that took business in house in august sales were benefited by owning dsi for months in compared to eight and a half months in  with the extra months of dsi operations contributing million in sales 
excluding all dsi sales recorded in both years million in and million in and excluding sales for the tape business that was lost in approximately million and the filter business that was sold in approximately million  north american sales declined by million or 
decorative specialties sales  primarily covering materials for book publishing and packaging  were million in versus million in sales increased in due to the full year benefits of the april rexam dsi acquisition 
however  comparing full year sales for both years  revenues from this business declined primarily due to a weak publishing market  in the face of industry wide manufacturer and publisher consolidations  job eliminations and competition from lower priced alternatives 
the elementary high school elhi segment was particularly affected in this period of unprecedented fiscal challenges for states and local school districts 
furthermore  weak packaging sales resulted from lower promotional expenditures and the weak european economy  where a significant portion of our specialty packaging business is generated 
durable specialties sales were million in versus million in  an decline 
this decline was primarily attributable to the loss of business brought in house by our largest us tape customer in august  which had provided approximately million in revenues 
office products sales were million in versus million in  a decline 
weak sales reflected the mature product categories in which our materials are primarily used  such as file folders  presentation covers  ring binders and school notebook covers 
to some degree  industry trends such as product downgrading  narrowing of product line offerings and retail pricing pressure  particularly given the increasing role of office products super stores  have adversely affected our sales volume and our margins in this business 
technical specialties sales were million in versus million in  a decrease 
sales declined in most major market areas primarily due to continued industrial economic weakness  the product life cycles of several mature businesses and selective market pruning as we transitioned materials previously manufactured at other facilities 
we also maintained steady sales levels in a few markets  notably electrical insulation materials 
filter media sales were million in compared with million in  a decrease primarily due to the sale of our north american engine filtration business 
additionally  although it did not impact sales  we sold a substantial portion of our industrial filter media business in the us on december  that accounted for approximately million in sales during nearly all of the year to year changes in sales were due to volume changes rather than to pricing changes 
company wide data for the company  gross margin increased to in from in due to lower pulp prices  improved production rates on our new paper machine in warren glen and in our german operations  reduced trial expenses and also reduced fixed costs related to facility consolidations 
paper machine capacity utilization was higher in versus due to improved balance between inventory and demand levels 
in we reduced the depreciable lives on certain fixed assets  which resulted in additional depreciation expense of million  and also recorded million of expense related to inventory revaluations 
general and administrative expenses for the company increased to million in compared to million in this increase is primarily due to the full year impact of the april   dsi acquisition million  million in severance expense related to a north american workforce reduction  and higher levels of legal and professional fees 
we incurred a million loss from operations of sales in versus income from operations of million of sales in in our german operations segment  income from operations increased to million of german operations sales from million of german operations sales in this increase was due to higher volume supported by capacity increases installed in  improved production rates and lower pulp prices 
in our north american operations segment our loss from operations increased by to million of north american operations sales from million of north american operations sales in this increased loss was primarily attributable to a million goodwill impairment charge 
north american operations were also negatively impacted by lower proceeds from sale of technology million  and were benefited by lower facility closure expenses million 
apart from these three items  income from north american operations would have improved by million in  reflecting improved production rates on our new paper machine in warren glen  lower pulp prices  reduced trial expenses and reduced fixed costs related to facility consolidations 
other expenses decreased to million in from million in due primarily to the cessation of goodwill amortization effective with the adoption of sfas no 
net interest expense was million in compared with million in this increase was primarily due to the full year impact in of debt related to the april dsi acquisition 
income taxes were million or of our pre tax loss in compared with a tax benefit of million or of our pre tax loss in in we recorded a million valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets because management determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would not be realized 
the net loss for was million  or per share  compared with a net loss of million  or per share  for the reasons described above 
year ended december   compared with year ended december  for the year ended december  net sales were million in compared with million in  a increase 
sales from german operations sales from german operations were million in compared with in  an increase of  due to higher sales in filter media and technical specialties million  partially offset by weaker sales in durable specialties million 
filter media sales were million in compared with million in  an increase of 
sales in automotive and vacuum bag filtration media were approximately million higher due to market growth  and even stronger in automotive filtration  where we continue to achieve market share gains due  in our view  to our strong technology and service 
technical specialties sales were million in compared with million in  an increase of 
sales in abrasive base papers were flat  and certain product lines such as those associated with the printing industry declined  as the european economy remained weak 
however  sales in nonwoven wallcovering base grew at double digit levels due to growth in this product category and market share gains in this young fibermark product line 
durable specialties tape base sales were million in versus million in  a decline of 
tape base business for masking tape was weak worldwide during  due primarily to weak european economic activity  particularly in home construction and repair demand 
additionally  demand for some original equipment applications painting aids for cars have declined due to technological changes in the painting process 
sales from north american operations sales from north american operations were million in versus million in  an increase of 
the dsi acquisition contributed million in sales from april   through year end 
the september sale of a portion of our north american engine filtration business accounted for a decline of approximately million in sales in  and revenues from other sources declined million  or 
durable specialties sales were million in versus million in  a decline of 
sales slumped worldwide in this market  particularly in the pacific rim  due to the impact of general economic weakness and a decline in usage for automotive masking tape in original equipment painting aid applications 
in addition  a key customer brought manufacturing in house accounting for a loss of approximately million in expected revenues over the final four months of the year 
office products sales were million in versus million  an decrease in due to weak economic activity  industry consolidation and lower sales in more price sensitive filing grades 
technical specialties sales were million in compared with million in  a decline of 
this decline was attributable to a general softening in the us economy  particularly the industrial sector  weaker demand for matboard and archival materials and reduced levels of electronic fabrication due to slumping high technology sales worldwide 
filter media sales in north american operations were million in compared with million in  a decline of due primarily to the sale of a portion of our north american engine filtration business  which accounted for approximately million of the decline 
company wide data for the company  gross margin decreased to in from in this decrease in gross margin was attributable to lower volume in our north american operations  inventory reduction efforts resulting in lower capacity utilization  expenses associated with the startup of our new paper machine at warren glen  new jersey  a new saturating line in germany and trial production expenses related to our north american consolidation program 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in this increase was concentrated in the north american segment  primarily due to the dsi acquisition 
income from operations decreased to million of sales in from million of sales in in our german operations segment  income from operations decreased to million of german operations sales in  from million of german operations sales in due to lower capacity utilization  inventory reductions and startup expenses on a new saturating line 
in our north american operations segment we incurred an million loss from operations in of north american operations sales as compared to income from operations of million of north american operations sales in this reduction was due to decreases previously mentioned in sales and gross profit and to higher facility closure expenses million in versus million in  offset in part by higher proceeds from sale of technology million in versus million in 
other expenses increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to the amortization of goodwill and deferred financing costs associated with the dsi acquisition 
net interest expense increased to million from million in this increase was due to our issuance of million of senior subordinated notes due in connection with the dsi acquisition 
income taxes were a benefit of million or of taxable losses in compared with million or of taxable income in the lower tax rate was due to reduced tax rates in germany and the impact of the goodwill write off in conjunction with the sale of the remainder of our us engine filter media volume 
the net loss for was million  or per share  compared with net income of million  or per share  for the tax adjusted impact of facility closure expenses and sale of technology proceeds was approximately million versus associated net income of approximately million in the remaining difference of million was caused by the other factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources we believe that cash flow from operations  plus existing cash balances and amounts available under credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures  debt service and working capital needs in our historical requirements for liquidity and capital have been primarily for servicing debt  capital expenditures and working capital 
for the twelve months ended december  cash flows from operating activities were million in and million in during these periods  additions to property  plant and equipment totaled million in and million in liquidity requirements during  we expect to require liquidity primarily for principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt and for capital expenditures 
for the year ending december   interest on our senior notes  payable semi annually  will be million and interest on secured term loans and the sale leaseback see note to the consolidated financial statements is estimated to be million  based on current libor rates 
principal payments required on these term loans and payments required under the sale leaseback transaction for the next months will be million 
we will balance the level of capital expenditures for the year against the strength of the economy and anticipate the range of spending to be from million in a weak economy to million in a more robust economy 
contractual obligations the following table lists our contractual obligations due by period with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year at december  in millions thereafter total long term debt letters of credit operating leases sale leaseback forward purchase contracts the majority of our forward purchase contracts relate to our natural gas purchases in the us  obligating us to purchase a minimum quantity each month during the contract period 
sources of funds as of december   we had outstanding million of senior notes  which mature on october   are non amortizing and carry a fixed interest rate of 
also outstanding are million of senior notes issued in conjunction with the dsi acquisition 
these notes have a ten year term beginning april   were issued at a discounted price of million and carry a fixed interest rate of 
in conjunction with the issuance of million of senior notes  we repaid all of our outstanding german bank debt totaling million  which resulted in an after tax repayment fee of million 
additionally  at december   we had available to us a million revolving credit facility with cit 
at that date  there was no balance outstanding under this credit facility  which matures on september  at december   million was outstanding on a term loan with jules and associates secured by the paper machine at the warren glen  new jersey  facility 
the interest rate on this loan is with the balance amortizing through july the term loan agreement secured by machinery at the warren glen facility requires the company to maintain a specified level of tangible net worth 
at december   the company was in violation of the covenant but has obtained a complete waiver of default from the lender  both at december  and prospectively 
as of the same date  million was outstanding on a term loan with cit secured by machinery at the quakertown  pennsylvania  facility 
the interest rate on this loan is libor with the balance amortizing through november the credit agreement with cit contains certain covenants  which require the maintenance of financial ratios 
testing of these covenants has been waived until december  during this grace period there is an availability block on the million revolving credit facility  which limits the company s borrowing capacity to approximately million 
in addition  we have million in letters of credit outstanding as of december  making effective availability million 
on december   we amended the agreement to establish a subfacility of million  under the million credit facility  a portion of which will be used for capital expenditures and a portion of which will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
at december   million was outstanding under this subfacility 
at december   total availability under the million credit facility was million  comprised of million under the subfacility and million under the primary facility 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
differences from those estimates are recorded in the reporting period during which the difference becomes known 
estimates are used in accounting for  among other items  facility closures  acquisitions  deferred tax assets  excess and obsolete inventory  allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and long lived assets 
those estimates which require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments are defined as critical and their accounting policies are described in further detail as follows facility closures among those factors affecting the accruals for facility closures are estimates of the number and types of employees that will be affected  the benefit costs related to those employees and the length of time until the operations can be consolidated within other facilities 
generally  we base our estimates on historical patterns of past facility closures  influe nced by judgments about current market conditions 
during we estimated facility closure charges of million relating to our fitchburg  massachusetts  facility and million for our rochester  michigan  facility 
in each case we found it appropriate to decrease the charge by million in based on actual experience 
in future years  the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  will limit the timing of recognition of costs associated with facility closures 
acquisitions we account for acquisitions under the purchase method which requires the purchase price to be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values 
for the many significant assets we acquire  such as property  plant and equipment  we obtain third party appraisals to determine the fair value of those assets 
in accounting for our acquisition of dsi in april  we estimated the fair value of property  plant  equipment  working capital and other assets and allocated million of the purchase price to goodwill 
income taxes we are required to estimate income taxes in each of our operational jurisdictions 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as property  plant and equipment  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  for which we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision benefit for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we have determined in the fourth quarter of that a valuation allowance is required based upon our estimate of future taxable income by operational jurisdiction and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in we recorded a million valuation allowance 
impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets long lived assets are required to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
facility closures and the sale of technology are events that have triggered such impairment reviews in the past 
property  plant and equipment to be disposed of as a result of facility closures are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
goodwill impairment as a result of the sale of technology was measured using the market value method prior to generally  the company bases its estimates on historical patterns  influenced by judgments about current market conditions 
beginning in  goodwill and other intangibles are assessed for impairment annually in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

we adopted sfas no 
effective january in our transitional goodwill assessment on january   our review indicated that no impairment charge was necessary 
however  as we progressed through the year  results in our north american operations were weaker than expected due to economic conditions in our markets and delays in implementation of our facility consolidations and the realization of related efficiencies 
consequently  we initiated a third party appraisal of our north american operations in the fourth quarter  using a september  measurement date to determine the carrying value of our goodwill and whether any impairment charge was indicated 
based on a fair market value determination reflecting the present value of our projected future cash flows using a discount rate of  and a compound sales growth rate of through and thereafter and the value of our property  plant and equipment and intellectual property  including proprietary technology  we wrote down our goodwill  resulting in an impairment charge of million 
pension assumptions we have several defined benefit retirement plans covering our hourly employees 
the defined benefit plan covering certain u 
s 
employees is an erisa and irs qualified plan and we make annual contributions in amounts at least equal to the minimum amounts required by erisa 
the defined benefit plans covering all hourly employees in germany were established by the company to provide a monthly pension benefit upon retirement 
we have no legal obligation to fund the german plans 
pension benefit obligations and the related effects on operations are calculated using actuarial models 
two critical assumptions  discount rate and expected return on assets  are important elements of plan expense and or liability measurement 
we evaluate these critical assumptions annually 
other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
these assumptions are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience 
actual results that differ from the estimates may result in more or less future company funding into the pension plans and more or less pension expense than is planned by management 
new accounting pronouncements in april the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
the pronouncement rescinds fasb statement no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishments of debt  and an amendment of that statement  fasb statement no 
 extinguishments of debt made to satisfy sinking fund requirements 
the pronouncement also rescinds fasb statement no 
 accounting for intangible assets of motor carriers and amends sfas no 
 accounting for leases  to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  we have evaluated this statement and determined that the impact will be to reclassify the loss on early extinguishment of debt in from an extraordinary item to other expense 
in july the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit including restructuring or disposal activities at fair value when the related liability is incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan as under current practice 
costs covered by the standard include certain contract termination costs  certain employee termination benefits and other costs to consolidate or close facilities and relocate employees that are associated with an exit activity or disposal of long lived assets 
the new requirements are effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   and we adopted them on january  we have reviewed all recently issued  but not yet effective  accounting pronouncements and do not believe any such pronouncements will have a material impact on our financial statements 
forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
any statements that are not historical  which may include forward looking words such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  intend  may  should  will and would or similar words  fall within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements  based on assumptions believed to be valid at the time  discuss our future expectations  contain projections of our future results of operations or of our financial position or state other forward looking information 
the following items  factors affecting future results  as well as any cautionary language in this report  provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward looking statements 
you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report 
we do not undertake to update any forward looking statement made in this report or that may  from time to time  be made by us  or on our behalf 
factors affecting future results our future results of operations and our financial position may be affected by a number of factors and risks  including  but not limited to  the following fluctuations in the costs and availability of raw materials could harm our business 
our principal raw materials  hardwood and softwood pulp  and secondary fiber  are cyclical in both price and supply 
the cyclical nature of pulp pricing presents a potential risk to our gross profit margins because we may not be able to pass along price increases to our customers 
we may also be unable to purchase pulp in sufficient quantities  or at acceptable prices  to meet our production requirements during times of tight supply 
dupont is the sole source of tyvek  a critical component in our binding tapes 
a significant price increase or any material limitation or interruption in our supply of key raw materials  including pulp  tyvek  or latex  particularly if we are unable to pass those increases through to our customers  could harm our financial condition  results of operations and competitive position 
fluctuations in economic activity and demand for our products could harm our business 
the markets for our products are variable and are influenced to a significant degree by the global economic activity and fluctuations in our customers demand and inventory levels 
downturns in global economic conditions and decreased demand for specialty fiber based materials could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
competition in specialty paper and materials markets could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
we face intense competition  which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
our principal competitors include a small number of paper and specialty paper manufacturers 
additionally  we compete with producers of vinyl  plastic or other materials 
some of these producers have substantially greater resources than we do 
further concentration of our competitors through mergers and acquisitions may increase their competitive advantage 
in addition  some of our customers have the internal ability to process some or all of the materials they buy from us  and have in the past elected to do so 
to the extent our customers elect to do so in the future  our business could suffer 
industry and market specific capacity levels can also affect competitive behavior and adversely impact pricing levels 
increased concentration of buying power in certain large direct or indirect customers can have similar effects 
our industry is subject to many environmental and other governmental regulations 
these regulations could give rise to significant additional liabilities or expenditures or restrictions on our business  any of which could cause our financial condition and results of operations to suffer 
our operations and properties are subject to a wide variety of foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations  including those governing the use  storage  handling  generation  treatment  emission  release  discharge and disposal of various materials  substances and wastes  the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater  and the health and safety of employees 
such regulations can restrict our operations  and expose us to claims and other liabilities with respect to environmental protection  remediation and health and safety matters 
we could incur material costs or other liabilities in connection with such regulations or claims 
in addition  future events  such as new information  changes in environmental or health and safety laws or regulations or their interpretation  and more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies  may result in significant additional expenditures  liabilities or restrictions that could harm our financial condition  results of operations and competitive position 
disruptions caused by labor disputes or organized labor activities may harm our business 
a large proportion of our workforce is represented by labor unions 
in addition  we may from time to time experience union organizing activities in currently non union facilities 
disputes with the current labor organizations with which we work or new union organizing activities may result in work slowdowns or stoppages or higher labor costs 
a work slowdown or stoppage in any one of our facilities could slow or halt production from that facility and from any other facility which depends on that facility for its material 
as a result  meeting scheduled delivery times for our customers could be difficult or impossible  which could result in loss of business 
our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition 
we have substantial indebtedness 
as of december   we had approximately million of indebtedness 
in addition  subject to restrictions in the indenture for our outstanding senior subordinated notes due notes  our revolving credit facility and the indenture for our outstanding series b senior notes due notes  we may incur additional indebtedness 
our high level of indebtedness could have important consequences  which might include the following impair our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes  reduce the funds available to us for other purposes such as capital expenditures  create a competitive disadvantage  to the extent that our indebtedness exceeds the level of some competitors  and reduce our flexibility in planning for  or responding to  changing conditions in our industry  including increased competition  increase our vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business  incur restrictions that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries  among other things  to incur additional indebtedness or liens  pay dividends or make other distributions  repurchase our common stock  make investments  sell assets  enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends  enter into transactions with affiliates  and consolidate  merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets 
we expect to obtain funds to service our debt over time primarily from our operations 
we cannot be certain that our cash flow will be sufficient to allow us to pay such debt service 
if we do not have sufficient cash flow  we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt  sell assets or borrow more money 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so on terms acceptable to us 
in addition  the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives 
the failure to generate sufficient cash flow or to achieve such alternatives could have a significant adverse affect on our ability to make required payments 
in addition  a breach of any of the financial covenants could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness 
if a default occurs  the relevant lenders and holders could elect to declare the indebtedness  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness 
inflation we attempt to minimize the effect of inflation on earnings by controlling operating expenses 
during the past several years  the rate of general inflation has been relatively low and has not had a significant impact on our results of operations 
we purchase raw materials that are subject to cyclical changes in costs that may not reflect the rate of general inflation 
seasonality our business is mildly seasonal  with the second half of each year typically having a lower level of net sales and operating income 
this seasonality is the result of summer manufacturing shutdowns and the impact of year end holidays 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe we have minimal exposure to financial market risks 
the majority of our debt is at a fixed rate 
most of our sales transactions have been conducted in the currency where the shipment originated  limiting our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments
