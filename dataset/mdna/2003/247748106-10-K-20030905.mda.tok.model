item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the kentucky public service commission regulates our utility operations 
as a part of this regulation  the kentucky public service commission sets the rates we are permitted to charge our customers 
these rates have a significant impact on our annual revenues and profits 
see business regulatory matters 
the rates approved by the kentucky public service commission allow us a specified rate of return on our regulated investment 
the rates we are allowed to charge our customers also permit us to pass through to our customers changes in the cost of our gas supply 
see business regulatory matters 
our regulated business is temperature sensitive 
our regulated sales volumes in any period reflect the impact of weather  with colder temperatures generally resulting in increased sales volumes 
we anticipate that this sensitivity to seasonal and other weather conditions will continue to be reflected in our sales volumes in future periods 
the impact of unusual winter temperatures on our revenues was ameliorated to some extent when the kentucky public service commission permitted us to start adjusting our winter rates in response to unusual winter temperatures in the year under the weather normalization tariff  we are permitted to increase our rates for residential and small non residential customers when  based on a year average temperatures  winter weather is warmer than normal  and we are required to decrease our rates when winter weather is colder than normal 
we are permitted to adjust these rates for the billing months of december through april 
liquidity and capital resources because of the seasonal nature of our regulated sales  we generate the smallest proportion of cash from operations during the warmer months  when sales volumes decrease considerably 
most of our construction activity takes place during these warmer months 
as a result  we meet our cash needs for operations and construction during the warmer non heating months partially through short term borrowings 
we made capital expenditures of   and  during the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
these capital expenditures were for system extensions and for the replacement and improvement of existing transmission  distribution  gathering  storage and general facilities 
we generate internally only a portion of the cash necessary for our capital expenditure requirements 
we finance the balance of our capital expenditures on an interim basis through a short term line of bank credit 
our current available line of credit is  of which  was borrowed at june  the line of credit is with branch banking and trust company  and extends through october  we intend to pursue renewal or to enter into a new agreement and seek substantially the same terms as the existing agreement 
we periodically repay our short term borrowings under our line of credit by using the net proceeds from the sale of long term debt and equity securities 
for example  during february   we issued  aggregate principal amount of debentures due the net proceeds of the offering were  we used the net proceeds to redeem  aggregate principal amount of our debentures due and to pay down our short term notes payable 
during may   we used the net proceeds of  from our sale of  shares of common stock to pay down our short term notes payable 
we will use additional borrowings under our existing line of credit to help meet working capital and capital expenditure needs as required 
below  we summarize our primary cash flows during the last three fiscal years indicated provided by operating activities    used in investing activities    provided by used in financing activities    increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents    for the year ended june   we had a  increase in cash and cash equivalents compared to a  increase in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended june  this variation resulted from an increase in cash provided by operating activities and a decrease in cash used in investing activities  partially offset by increases in cash used in financing activities 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities was largely due to changes in accounts payable  deferred income taxes and gas in storage  offset by changes in accounts receivable  prepayments and deferred gas costs 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities resulted from decreased capital expenditures 
the increase in cash used in financing activities is primarily attributable to the repayment of short term debt  offset by the issuance of additional long term debt and equity 
for the year ended june   we had a  increase in cash and cash equivalents compared to a  decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended june  this variation resulted from an increase in cash provided by operating activities  offset by increases in cash used in investing and financing activities 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities was largely due to changes in deferred recovery of gas costs  accounts receivable  accounts payable and deferred income taxes 
the increase in cash used in investing activities resulted from increased capital expenditures 
cash was used in financing activities in since dividends paid on common stock and repayments of long term debt exceeded borrowings from the short term line of credit 
cash was provided by financing activities in since borrowings from the short term line of credit exceeded dividends paid on common stock and repayments of long term debt 
cash provided by our operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for non cash items  including depreciation  depletion  amortization  deferred income taxes and changes in working capital 
we expect that internally generated cash  coupled with short term borrowings  will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and normal capital expenditure requirements and to pay dividends for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future 
results of operations for meaningful analysis of our revenue and expense variations  the variation amounts and percentages presented below for regulated and non regulated revenues and expenses include intersegment transactions 
these intersegment revenues and expenses whose variations are also disclosed in the following tables  are eliminated in the consolidated statements of income 
operating revenues in the following table we set forth variations in our revenues for the last two fiscal years compared compared to to increase decrease in our regulated revenues gas rates   weather normalization adjustment   sales volumes   on system transportation   off system transportation   other   total   increase decrease in our non regulated revenues gas rates   sales volumes   other   total   total increase decrease in our revenues   decrease in our intersegment revenues   increase decrease in our consolidated   revenues percentage increase decrease in our regulated volumes gas sales on system transportation off system transportation percentage decrease in non regulated gas sales volumes 
heating degree days billed were of normal thirty year average temperatures for fiscal  as compared with of normal temperatures for and of normal for a heating degree day results from a day during which the average of the high and low temperature is at least one degree less than degrees fahrenheit 
the increase in operating revenues for of  was primarily due to the increase in our regulated volumes because of the significantly colder weather in  as well as the increases in gas costs reflected in higher sales prices 
this increase  however  was offset to some extent because unusually cold temperatures caused us to adjust our rates downward under our authorized weather normalization tariff 
the decrease in our non regulated sales volumes and our intersegment revenues is a result of the non regulated segment discontinuing the practice of selling gas to the regulated segment effective january  the decrease of  in our operating revenues for was primarily attributable to decreased sales volumes and decreased gas rates 
sales volumes decreased due to warmer winter weather in gas rates decreased due to lower gas prices 
this increase  however  was offset to some extent  because unusually warm temperatures enabled us to adjust our rates upward under our authorized weather normalization tariff 
operating expenses in the following table we set forth variations in our purchased gas expense for the last two fiscal years compared compared to to increase decrease in our regulated gas expense gas rates   purchase volumes   total   increase decrease in our non regulated gas expense gas rates   purchase volumes   transportation expense   total   decrease increase in our intersegment gas expense   increase decrease in our consolidated gas expense   the increase in purchased gas expense for of  was due primarily to the increase in the cost of gas purchased for regulated sales and the increase in regulated volumes sold 
the decrease in purchased gas expense for of  was due primarily to the decrease in the cost of gas purchased for regulated sales and the decrease in non regulated volumes sold 
the increase in operation and maintenance expense of  for the year ended june  was primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense resulting from higher gas prices and colder winter weather  as well as an increase in employee benefit costs 
the increase in taxes other than income taxes for the year ended june  of  was primarily due to increased property taxes 
basic and diluted earnings per common share for the fiscal years ended june   and  our basic earnings per common share changed as a result of changes in net income and an increase in the number of our common shares outstanding 
we increased our number of common shares outstanding as a result of shares issued through our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan  our employee stock purchase plan and our may  common stock offering 
we have no potentially dilutive securities 
as a result  our basic earnings per common share and our diluted earnings per common share are the same 
pension benefits our reported costs of providing pension benefits as described in note a of the notes to financial statements are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
pension costs associated with our defined benefit pension plan  for example  are impacted by employee demographics including age  compensation levels  and employment periods  the level of contributions we make to the plan and earnings on plan assets 
changes made to the provisions of the plan may impact current and future pension costs 
pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  changes in pension obligations associated with the above factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement  but may be deferred and amortized in the future over the average remaining service period of active plan participants to the extent that statement recognition provisions are triggered 
for the years ended june   and  we recorded pension costs for our defined benefit pension plan of   and  respectively 
effective april   our board of directors adopted a plan amendment which enhanced the formula for benefits paid under the company s defined benefit retirement plan 
in september   our board of directors approved an amendment to the plan effective november  the plan amendment reduced the formula for benefits paid under the plan for future service and restricted participants from taking lump sum distributions from the plan 
our pension plan assets are principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments 
differences between actual portfolio returns and expected returns may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods 
likewise  changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase or decrease recorded pension costs 
in selecting our discount rate assumption we considered rates of return on high quality fixed income investments that are expected to be available through the maturity dates of the pension benefits 
in establishing our expected long term rate of return assumption  we utilize analysis prepared by our investment manager 
our expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is and is based on our targeted asset allocation assumption of approximately percent equity investments and approximately percent fixed income investments 
our approximately percent equity investment target includes allocations to domestic  international  and emerging markets managers 
our asset allocation is designed to achieve a moderate level of overall portfolio risk in keeping with our desired risk objective 
we regularly review our asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation as appropriate 
we calculate the expected return on assets in our determination of pension cost based on the market value of assets at the measurement date 
using the market value recognizes investment gains or losses in the year in which they occur 
based on our assumed long term rate of return of percent  discount rate of percent  and various other assumptions  we estimate that our pension costs associated with our defined benefits pension plan will increase from  in to approximately  in modifying the expected long term rate of return on our pension plan assets by 
percent would change pension costs for by approximately  modifying the discount rate assumption by 
percent would change pension costs by approximately factors that may affect future results management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the other sections of this report contain forward looking statements that are not statements of historical facts 
we have attempted to identify these statements by using words such as estimates  attempts  expects  monitors  plans  anticipates  intends  continues  believes  seeks  strives and similar expressions 
these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements about o our operational plans and strategies  o the cost and availability of our natural gas supplies  o our capital expenditures  o sources and availability of funding for our operations and expansion  o our anticipated growth and growth opportunities through system expansion and acquisition  o competitive conditions that we face  o our production  storage  gathering and transportation activities  o regulatory and legislative matters  and o dividends factors that could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward looking statements or historical results include the impact or outcome of o the ongoing restructuring of the natural gas industry and the outcome of the regulatory proceedings related to that restructuring  o the changing regulatory environment  generally  o a change in the rights under present regulatory rules to recover for costs of gas supply  other expenses and investments in capital assets  o uncertainty in our capital expenditure requirements  o changes in economic conditions  demographic patterns and weather conditions in our retail service areas  o changes affecting our cost of providing gas service  including changes in gas supply costs  cost and availability of interstate pipeline capacity  interest rates  the availability of external sources of financing for our operations  tax laws  environmental laws and the general rate of inflation  o changes affecting the cost of competing energy alternatives and competing gas distributors  and o changes in accounting principles and tax laws or the application of such principles and laws to us 
contractual obligations the following is provided to summarize our contractual cash obligations for the periods after june  payments due by period after total long term debt a      operating lease b      gas purchase obligations      total contractual obligations      a see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
b the operating lease amount after june  includes the present value of leases having an indeterminate life 
these leases relate primarily to storage well and compressor station site leases 
for the purpose of this calculation we have assumed a year life for these agreements 
to the extent that these leases extend beyond  the annual lease payments will be  new accounting pronouncements in june   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 entitled accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred and is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we have not committed to any such exit or disposal plan 
accordingly  this new statement will not presently have any impact on us 
in june   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 entitled accounting for asset retirement obligations  and delta adopted this statement effective july  statement no 
addresses financial accounting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
upon adoption of this statement  we recorded  of asset retirement obligations in the balance sheet primarily representing the current estimated fair value of our obligation to plug oil and gas wells at the time of abandonment 
of this amount   was recorded as incremental cost of the underlying property  plant and equipment 
the cumulative effect on earnings of adopting this new statement was a charge to earnings of  net of income taxes of  representing the cumulative amounts of depreciation and depletion expenses and changes in the asset retirement obligation due to the passage of time for historical accounting periods 
the adoption of the new standard did not have a significant impact on income before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended june  pro forma net income and earnings per share have not been presented for the years ended june  and because the pro forma application of statement no 
to prior periods would result in pro forma net income and earnings per share not materially different from the actual amounts reported for those periods in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
we also have asset retirement obligations which have indeterminate settlement dates 
these obligations  relating to gas wells and lines at our storage facility and compressor station sites  are not recorded until an estimated range of potential settlement dates is known  according to statement no 
as allowed for ratemaking purposes and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 entitled accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  we accrue costs of removal on long lived assets through depreciation expense if we believe removal of the assets at the end of their useful life is likely 
approximately  of accrued cost of removal is recorded in the accumulated provision for depreciation on the accompanying balance sheet as of june  in august   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 entitled accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
statement no 
addresses accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
statement no 
was effective july  there was no impact of implementation on our financial position and results of operations 
in december   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 entitled accounting for stock based compensation 
statement no 
was effective for the june  fiscal year 
there was no impact of implementation on our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we purchase our gas supply through a combination of spot market gas purchases and forward gas purchases 
the price of spot market gas is based on the market price at the time of delivery 
the price we pay for our natural gas supply acquired under our forward gas purchase contracts  however  is fixed months prior to the delivery of the gas 
additionally  we inject some of our gas purchases into gas storage facilities in the non heating months and withdraw this gas from storage for delivery to customers during the heating season 
we have minimal price risk resulting from these forward gas purchase and storage arrangements  because we are permitted to pass these gas costs on to our regulated customers through the gas cost recovery rate mechanism 
as a part of our unregulated transportation activities  we periodically contract with our transportation customers to acquire gas that we will transport to these customers 
at the time we make a sales commitment to one of these customers  we attempt to cover this position immediately with gas purchase commitments that match the terms of the related sales contract in order to minimize our price volatility risk 
none of our gas contracts are accounted for using the fair value method of accounting 
while some of our gas purchase contracts meet the definition of a derivative  we have designated these contracts as normal purchases under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 entitled accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates on our variable rate notes payable 
the interest rate on our current short term line of credit with branch banking and trust company is benchmarked to the monthly london interbank offered rate 
the balance on our short term line of credit was  on june  and  on june  based on the amount of our outstanding short term line of credit on june   a one percent one hundred basis point increase in our average interest rate would result in a decrease in our annual pre tax net income of
