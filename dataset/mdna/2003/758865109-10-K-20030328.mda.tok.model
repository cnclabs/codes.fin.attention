item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction general our company was formed in november to acquire  own and operate clusters of radio stations in mid sized and small markets 
the proceeds from our january initial public offering ipo  proceeds from our april offering of common stock  and borrowings under our credit facility have given us the ability to increase our size significantly over the past three years 
we currently own radio stations in markets 
during  we acquired three radio stations in our flint  michigan market  one radio station in our grand rapids  michigan market  and disposed of one radio station in albany  new york 
in february  we completed the purchase of radio stations in five new markets 
in conjunction with the pending acquisition of these stations  we provided the stations with programming and other services beginning in september we have the following pending transactions 
the exchange of four radio stations we currently own in one market for five radio stations in a market we have a presence in 
in march  we began providing programming and other services to the stations we intend to acquire  and the purchaser of the stations we intend to sell began providing the same such services to those stations 
the purchase of two radio stations in an existing market  one of which we began providing programming and other services to in february the principal source of our revenue is the sale of broadcasting time on our radio stations for advertising 
as a result  our revenue is affected primarily by the advertising rates our radio stations charge 
correspondingly  the rates are based upon a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers  as measured principally by periodic arbitron radio market reports 
in  our radio stations derived approximately of their net broadcast revenues from local and regional advertising in the markets in which they operated  and the remainder resulted principally from the sale of national advertising  network compensation payments and other miscellaneous transactions 
the financial results of our business are seasonal 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  our first calendar quarter will be expected to produce the lowest revenues for the year  and the fourth calendar quarter will be expected to produce the highest revenues for the year 
our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of the advertising and promotion is realized in future periods 
prior to  and excluding gains on the sale or exchange of radio stations  we had historically generated net losses  primarily as a result of significant non cash charges for depreciation and amortization relating to the acquisitions of radio stations and interest charges on outstanding debt 
prior to new guidance that was issued by the financial accounting standards board in relating to purchase accounting and the amortization of intangible assets  we historically amortized on a straight line method over a to year period  the fcc licenses and goodwill attributable to substantially all of our radio stations 
during  the financial accounting standards board issued new guidance on purchase accounting and the amortization of intangible assets  which significantly reduced the amount of non cash amortization charges we recognized in our financial statements in goodwill and fcc licenses we recorded for acquisitions that we completed subsequent to july   were not amortized due to this new guidance  and beginning january   we ceased amortizing all goodwill and fcc licenses 
based upon the large number of acquisitions we 
table of contents consummated within the last three years  we anticipate that depreciation charges will continue to be significant for several years 
to the extent that we complete additional acquisitions  our interest expense and depreciation charges related to property and equipment and other intangible assets are likely to increase 
our financial results are dependent on a number of factors  including the general strength of the local and national economies  population growth  the ability to provide popular programming  local market and regional competition  relative efficiency of radio broadcasting compared to other advertising media  signal strength and government regulation and policies 
from time to time  the markets in which we operate experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect our revenue 
we believe  however  that this impact is somewhat mitigated by our diverse geographical presence 
effect of recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of statement no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years ending after december   with earlier application permitted in certain circumstances 
the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  we have adopted the annual financial statement disclosure provisions of sfas and have reflected such disclosures in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have not yet determined the impact  if any  of the transition and interim financial statement disclosure provisions of sfas in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin provides for an interpretation of statements of financial accounting standards nos 
  and  and rescission of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
fin also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
we will adopt fin effective january  and will apply its provisions prospectively to all guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not believe the impact of adoption  if any  will materially impact our financial position  cash flows or result of operations 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas addresses the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including costs related to terminating contracts that are not capital leases and termination benefits that employees who are involuntarily terminated receive in certain instances 
sfas supersedes emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf and requires liabilities associated with exit and disposal activities to be expensed as incurred 
we will adopt sfas effective january   and apply its provisions accordingly 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of sfas nos 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections sfas 
sfas rescinds fasb statement no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  and an amendment of that statement  fasb statement no 
 extinguishments of debt made to satisfy sinking fund requirements 
as a result  gains and losses from extinguishments of debt should be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in apb opinion no 
 reporting 
table of contents the results of operations  reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions apb 
applying the provisions of apb will distinguish transactions that are part of an entity s recurring operations from those that are unusual or infrequent or that meet the criteria for classification as an extraordinary item 
sfas also amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases  to eliminate inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
this statement also rescinds fasb statement no 
 accounting for intangible assets of motor carriers and amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
we adopted this standard for lease transactions entered into after may  and have determined the impact of adoption to be immaterial 
the provisions of sfas related to debt extinguishments will be adopted on january   and could have an impact on us  to the extent that we would make any changes to our credit facility 
we had no debt extinguishments during the year ended december  in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas that addresses the recognition of asset retirement obligations 
the objective of sfas is to provide guidance for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we will adopt sfas as required in the year  and have determined the impact of adoption to be immaterial 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgements and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  the most significant of which include establishing allowances for doubtful accounts  evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets  allocating the purchase price of acquisitions  and determining the recoverability of our long lived assets 
the basis for our estimates are historical experience and various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  given the available information at the time of the estimate  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we routinely review customer account activity in order to assess the adequacy of the allowances provided for potential losses 
our allowance is calculated based upon a percentage of cash revenues  and includes a provision for known issues 
based on historical information  we believe that our allowance is adequate 
however  changes in general economic  business and market conditions could affect the ability of our customers to make their required payments  therefore  the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed monthly and changes to the allowance are updated as new information is received 
although no near term changes are expected  unforeseen changes to future allowance percentages could materially impact overall financial results 
deferred tax assets at december   we had a deferred tax asset of approximately million  the primary component of which is our net operating loss carryforwards 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we recorded million of income tax expense to establish valuation allowances on net operating loss carryforwards scheduled to expire in the years through the recording of the million valuation allowance resulted in a net deferred tax asset of million 
we have determined that it is not necessary to record a valuation allowance against our net operating loss carryforwards for years through  based on estimated future taxable income during those years 
our estimated future taxable income in those periods takes into consideration the run off of significant tax amortization related to existing fcc licenses and deductible goodwill by the decision to record 
table of contents the valuation allowance was based on the downturn in economic conditions that have reduced private market values of radio station assets and limited our ability to implement our tax planning strategy to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards 
the need to record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets is reviewed quarterly  and if we were to determine that we would be unable to realize a portion  or the remainder of the deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be recorded as expense in the period such determination was made 
additionally  if it were determined that we would be able to utilize a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards that are reserved for in the valuation allowance  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded as a reduction of expense 
if our provisions for current or deferred taxes are not adequate due to unfavorable law changes or unforeseen economic conditions  we could experience losses in excess of the current or deferred income tax provisions we have established 
acquisition of radio stations the total cost of acquired stations is allocated to the underlying net assets of such stations  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including assumptions with respect to asset lives and market multiples  among other items 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  long lived assets to be held and used fixed assets and definite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset 
if we were to determine that the carrying amount of an asset was not recoverable  we would record an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
we determine the fair value of our long lived assets based upon the market value of similar assets  if available  or independent appraisals  if necessary 
long lived assets to be disposed of and or held for sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell 
we determine the fair value of these assets in the same manner as described for assets held and used 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas in june sfas specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
sfas requires that a company no longer amortize goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite life and also requires an annual impairment testing of those assets 
our fcc licenses qualify as indefinite lived intangible assets  and represent a significant portion of the assets on our balance sheet 
consistent with the application provisions of sfas  we apply a fair value approach employing a discounted cash flow methodology to test impairment of both indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill on a market by market basis 
to arrive at a value for discounted cash flow of a market  management relies upon estimates of future cash flows and the effects of changes in business conditions 
to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets  an impairment loss will be recorded 
sfas also requires intangible assets with definite useful lives to continue to be amortized over their respective useful lives and be tested for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable

results of operations following is a discussion of the key factors that have affected our business over the last three years 
this commentary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related footnotes included herein 
compared to results from operations in  as compared to  were affected considerably by full year results for our acquisitions in peoria  illinois  lafayette  louisiana  and to a lesser extent  erie  pennsylvania  and our acquisitions of radio stations in flint and grand rapids  michigan  as well as the disposition of our stations in palmdale  california 
additionally  in september  we began operating the brill media stations under time brokerage agreements 
accordingly  the results of our operations in are not comparable to those of the prior period  nor are they necessarily indicative of future results 
additionally  our results for the third and fourth quarters of were negatively impacted by the september  terrorist attacks  and we cannot predict the effect on our operations  if any  of any future terrorist attacks or the impact of the war in the middle east 
net broadcast revenues net broadcast revenues were approximately million in  a increase over net revenues of approximately million 
approximately million of the increase was attributable to full year results for stations we acquired in results for the stations we acquired or began operations under time brokerage agreements in contributed approximately million of the net revenue increase  and the remainder was due to revenue increases at stations we owned for both years  offset partially by the sale of our palmdale  california stations during station operating expenses operating expenses were approximately million in  compared to approximately million in the increase is primarily a result of full year results for the stations we acquired in  which represented approximately million of the increase  as well as expenses for the stations we purchased or operated under time brokerage agreements in  which added approximately million of additional operating expense 
a significant portion of the increase in our operating expense was due to research and 
table of contents promotional expenses we incurred to properly target our intended demographic audiences within our markets  as well as to promote our radio stations through various advertising campaigns and contest prize give aways  which we believe will promote long term growth at our radio stations 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased by  from approximately million in  to approximately million in effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas  which eliminated the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets determined to have an indefinite life  and also requires an annual impairment testing of those assets 
amortization expense related to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets was approximately million  net of income taxes  for the year ended december  corporate expense corporate general and administrative expenses increased from approximately million in to approximately million in this increase was due to a combination of the following salary components of two employees who were charged at the market level in and were charged to corporate expense in  due to our ability to leverage those resources at the corporate level  increased legal expenses  implementation of and compliance with various provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  an increase in directors and officers insurance premiums  and compensation paid to outside directors for their service on the company s board of directors  a policy which began in impairment of goodwill in conjunction with our annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  it was determined that the fair value of goodwill for our peoria  illinois market was less than the carrying value of the goodwill recorded in our financial statements 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million  net of income taxes  against operating income 
gain on sale of long lived assets on march   we completed the sale of wgna am in albany  new york for million in cash 
we recorded a pre tax gain of approximately  on the sale 
we treated the disposal of wgna am as the disposal of long lived assets  rather than a business or a component of a business  due to the fact that the station had no independent revenue stream from its operations 
interest expense interest expense decreased by in compared to the decrease was primarily the result of the paydown of outstanding debt under our credit facility with proceeds from our april stock offering 
also contributing to the decrease was lower interest rates throughout  as compared to the weighted average interest rate for the year was  compared to for the year 
the weighted average interest rate at december  was  as compared to an average interest rate of at december  gain on the sale of radio stations on june   we completed the sale of our three stations in palmdale  california to concord media group  inc we recognized a pre tax gain of approximately million on this transaction  which is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  income taxes we recorded income tax expense of approximately million in  prior to the income tax benefit from cumulative effect of accounting change 
this represents a federal rate and a state rate  and 
table of contents includes million of income tax expense related to the establishment of valuation allowances on our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards scheduled to expire in the years through we have cumulative federal and state tax loss carryforwards of approximately million at december  which expire in the years through the utilization of a portion of these net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes is limited  pursuant to the annual utilization limitations provided under the provisions of internal revenue code section in arriving at the determination as to the amount of the valuation allowance required for the years ended december  and  we considered the impact of deferred tax liabilities resulting from purchase transactions  statutory restrictions on the use of operating losses  and a tax planning strategy available to us 
consequently  during the second half of  we determined that when considering the current state of private market values for radio station assets  it would be more likely than not that we would not be able to implement our tax planning strategy within the foreseeable future 
cumulative effect of accounting change upon the adoption of sfas  we completed a transitional impairment analysis of our indefinite lived fcc licenses and recorded an impairment loss of approximately million  net of income tax benefit of approximately million 
additionally  we completed the two step transitional impairment analysis of goodwill and recorded an impairment loss of approximately million  net of income tax benefit of approximately million 
to estimate fair value  we used a discounted cash flow methodology 
these losses are reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  same station results the performance of a radio station group  such as ours  is customarily measured by its ability to generate broadcast cash flow 
the term broadcast cash flow means operating income loss before depreciation and amortization  corporate general and administrative expenses  gain loss on sale of long lived assets and impairment of goodwill and fcc licenses 
although broadcast cash flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we believe that broadcast cash flow is accepted by the broadcasting industry as a generally recognized measure of performance and is used by analysts who report publicly on the performance of broadcasting companies 
nevertheless  this measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income loss  net income loss  net cash provided by used in operating activities or any other measure for determining our operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
while acquisitions have affected the comparability of our operating results to those of  we believe meaningful quarter to quarter comparisons can be made for results of operations for those markets in which we have been operating for five full quarters  exclusive of markets disposed of during those years 
these comparable results between and are listed in the table below by quarter  excluding the effect of barter transactions dollars in thousands 
net net broadcast broadcast revenue revenue change cash flow cash flow change quarter same stations stations in markets remaining stations and barter effect total revenue for the first quarter of was negatively impacted by the weak economy 
in addition  we had a very successful first quarter of  making comparable revenue growth in difficult  given the 
table of contents economic climate 
these two factors resulted in a corresponding decrease in broadcast cash flow compared to the prior year quarter 
net net broadcast broadcast revenue revenue change cash flow cash flow change quarter same stations stations in markets remaining stations and barter effect total revenue for the second quarter was flat compared to the prior year quarter results  as economic conditions showed little improvement 
broadcast cash flow increased over the prior year quarter due to cost savings in administrative and promotional expenses 
net net broadcast broadcast revenue revenue change cash flow cash flow change quarter same stations stations in markets remaining stations and barter effect total the events of september  had a significant impact on the company s net revenue and broadcast cash flow for the third quarter of the third quarter of reflects improved results  as well as increases in political revenue due to cyclical elections 
net net broadcast broadcast revenue revenue change cash flow cash flow change quarter same stations stations in markets remaining stations and barter effect total net revenue for the fourth quarter of showed improvements in the advertising environment  along with the relative maturity of our portfolio over the same period of the prior year 
compared to net broadcast revenue and station operating expenses in compared to  we experienced increases in net broadcast revenues and station operating expenses  due primarily to our year acquisition of radio stations in peoria  illinois and full year results for our year acquisitions in albany  new york and grand rapids  michigan 
these acquisitions contributed approximately million of the increase in net revenue in over  and approximately million of the increase in operating expense for the same periods 
offsetting these increases were decreases in the same categories due to the disposition in of our palmdale  california radio stations and our year dispositions of our flagstaff  arizona  mansfield  ohio  and victorville  california markets  which accounted for approximately million and million of the variances in net revenue and operating expense  respectively 
additionally  our results were impacted by the events of september  
table of contents depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased by from this is due to a combination of a full year of depreciation and amortization expense for acquisitions that occurred at various times throughout the year  plus depreciation expense on approximately million of depreciable property and equipment additions attributable to station acquisitions in  and to a lesser extent  depreciation on approximately million of capital expenditures during corporate expenses corporate general and administrative expenses increased from approximately million in to approximately million in beginning in the second quarter of  we began increasing the size of our infrastructure to meet the demands of supporting a public company whose stock is listed on a national stock market 
interest expense interest expense decreased by in compared to after removing the effect of approximately million of the interest expense  which was the result of the mark to fair market value of our warrant liability  interest expense increased approximately 
the increase is due to an average debt level of approximately million during compared to approximately million in average debt levels were lower in as we had paid down all our debt with proceeds from the ipo in january and subsequently did not incur any borrowings under our new credit facility until august the increase in interest expense was mitigated somewhat by significant decreases in interest rates during the weighted average interest rate was for the year  compared to for the year 
the weighted average interest rates were approximately and at december  and  respectively 
gain on the sale of radio stations on june   we completed the sale of our three stations in palmdale  california to concord media group  inc we recognized a pre tax gain of approximately million on this transaction  which is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  on august   we completed an exchange agreement entered into with clear channel broadcasting  inc  capstar radio operating company and their affiliates  in which we exchanged our eight stations serving the mansfield  ohio fm am and victorville  california fm am markets plus approximately million in cash for ten stations serving the grand rapids  michigan fm am and albany  new york fm am markets 
as a result of this transaction  we recognized a pre tax gain on the exchange of approximately million  which is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  income tax benefit we recorded an income tax benefit of  in this tax benefit represents a federal rate offset by state income taxes and the amortization of intangibles in excess of the amounts that are deductible for tax purposes 
at december   we had cumulative federal and state tax loss carryforwards of approximately million 
these loss carryforwards had expiration dates in years through the utilization of a portion of these net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes is limited pursuant to the annual utilization limitations provided under the provisions of internal revenue code section in arriving at the determination as to the amount of the valuation allowance required for the years ended december  and  we considered the impact of deferred tax liabilities resulting from purchase transactions  statutory restrictions on the use of operating losses  and a tax planning strategy available to us 
consequently  we determined that no valuation allowance was required at december  and during  we released the entire valuation allowance 
as a result of these events  no income tax expense was recorded in 
table of contents extraordinary loss on january   we paid off the outstanding debt  accrued interest and related fees from our old credit facility  totaling approximately million  using proceeds from our ipo 
this final paydown resulted in an extraordinary loss of approximately million  net of income tax  from the write off of deferred financing costs 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents balance at december  was approximately million compared to approximately million at december  net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million in  compared to approximately million in the increase was due primarily to the operating activities of radio stations acquired or operated under time brokerage agreements in and in the latter part of cash flow used in investing activities was approximately million in compared to approximately million in the decrease is due primarily to fewer acquisitions of radio stations in compared to  offset by proceeds from the disposition of radio stations in cash flows used in financing activities were approximately million  compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of approximately million in during  proceeds received from our april stock offering and the final proceeds received from our november private placement of equity were used to repay borrowings under our credit facility 
additionally  approximately million was used to purchase treasury stock during the last half of during  cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of debt issued in connection with our acquisitions and a private placement of equity securities during the fourth quarter 
sources of funds in  our sources of cash totaled approximately million and were derived from a combination of net proceeds from our april common stock offering  cash provided by operating activities  borrowings under our credit facility  net proceeds from the sale of long lived assets  and final payment for shares issued during our november private placement of equity 
on april   we completed the sale of million shares of common stock at a price of per share 
net cash proceeds after underwriting discounts and commissions were approximately million 
approximately million of the proceeds were used to pay down outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
the remaining million of proceeds were used to fund a portion of the purchase price of two radio stations purchased during we have a credit agreement with a group of lenders that provides for a senior reducing revolving credit facility in the initial amount of million  maturing december  the credit facility permits the borrowing of available credit for working capital requirements and general corporate purposes  including transaction fees and expense  and to fund permitted acquisitions 
the facility also permits us to request from time to time that the lenders issue letters of credit in an aggregate amount up to million in accordance with the same lending provisions 
mandatory prepayments and commitment reductions are required upon certain asset sales  subordinated debt proceeds  excess cash flow amounts and sales of equity securities 
on april   the provisions of the excess cash flow calculation reduced our available commitment by approximately million  and in april  the provisions under that calculation will further reduce our available commitment by approximately million 
the commitment and our maximum borrowings  
table of contents including the permanent reduction due to excess cash flow and the scheduled quarterly reductions  reduce over five years  beginning in  as follows in thousands december  commitment amount the scheduled reduction in available commitment amounts each year occurs ratably over each quarter 
for  the quarterly reduction amount for the first quarter was  the remaining quarterly reductions were reduced to approximately million per quarter  due to the permanent reduction in the facility from the april excess cash flow reduction 
the million letter of credit sub limit also reduces proportionately but not below million 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the april  public sale of our common stock  which we used to pay down approximately million of outstanding indebtedness under the facility 
under the terms and conditions of the credit facility  the borrowings available to us would have been permanently reduced by the net proceeds we received from the stock offering 
however  we exercised our option to provide a reinvestment notice to the lender  which allowed us to re borrow substantially all of such proceeds for acquisitions and other permitted investments which were complete and or for which binding agreements were obtained within days of such election 
our brill media and agm nevada purchases qualify under such election  and in february  we re borrowed million of the amounts covered by the reinvestment notice to fund the brill media purchase 
we intend to re borrow at least million of the purchase price of the agm nevada acquisition  the minimum portion which must be paid in cash  and may  at our option  fund the entire million purchase price through borrowings under the credit facility 
consequently  borrowings under the facility were permanently reduced in january  by approximately million 
under the credit facility  we are required to maintain a minimum interest rate coverage ratio  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  maximum corporate overhead  and maximum financial leverage ratio and to observe negative covenants customary for facilities of this type 
borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to  at our option  either a the higher of the rate announced or published publicly from time to time by the agent as its corporate base of interest or the overnight federal funds rate plus  in either case plus the applicable margin determined under the credit facility  or b the reserve adjusted eurodollar rate plus the applicable margin which varies between and depending upon our financial leverage 
borrowings under the credit facility bore interest at an average rate of as of december  we are required to pay certain fees to the agent and the lenders for the underwriting commitment  which varies between and depending upon the amount of the facility utilized and our leverage ratio  and for the administration and use of the credit facility 
our indebtedness under the credit facility is collateralized by liens on substantially all of our assets and by a pledge of our operating and license subsidiaries stock and is guaranteed by these subsidiaries 
as of march  we had borrowings under this facility of approximately million 
on march   we completed the disposition of substantially all the operating assets of wgna am  serving the albany  new york market  for million in cash to abc  inc on february   abc  inc 
began providing programming and other services to the station under a time brokerage agreement 
we recognized a pre tax gain on the sale of approximately  the proceeds from the sale of the station were used to pay down borrowings under our credit facility 
on february   we received approximately million from the release of an escrow account holding  shares of our common stock 
the shares  sold to a venture capital fund related to one of our independent directors  were part of our november private placement offering of  shares issued at per share  and were held in escrow pending confirmation from nasdaq that stockholder approval would 
table of contents not be required for such sale 
the proceeds from the private placement were used to pay down borrowings under our credit facility 
uses of funds in  we utilized our sources of cash primarily to repay borrowings of approximately million under our credit facility  acquire radio stations and pay related acquisition costs totaling approximately million  and repurchase shares of our common stock for approximately million 
additionally in  we funded capital expenditures of approximately million to upgrade our equipment and consolidate duplicate facilities in order to remain competitive and to create cost savings over the long term 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million in the increase is due primarily to  planned expansions to accommodate recent station acquisitions  consolidations to eliminate duplicate facilities  and general increases in expenditures due to significantly more owned and operated stations in on february   we completed the acquisition of radio stations from brill media company llc and its related entities 
we began providing programming and other services to the stations under a time brokerage agreement on september  the stations we acquired and the markets they serve are as follows wiov fm and wiov am  serving the lancaster reading  pennsylvania market wkdq fm  wbkr fm and womi am  serving the evansville  indiana and owensboro  kentucky markets ktrr fm  kuad fm and kkqz fm formerly a construction permit prior to commencing broadcast operations on november  serving the ft 
collins greeley  colorado market  and kkcb fm  kldj fm  kbmx fm and webc am  serving the duluth  minnesota market the purchase price of these assets was approximately million  which we paid in cash through borrowings under our credit facility
