item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
we are a fully integrated  self administered  and self managed real estate investment trust reit which owns  manages  leases  develops  and redevelops office and industrial real estate  primarily in the chicago metropolitan area 
our portfolio of completed properties as of december  consists of office properties  containing an aggregate of million net rentable square feet  and industrial properties  containing an aggregate of million net rentable square feet 
this includes our recently completed bank one corporate center in downtown chicago  a million rentable square foot office tower that was placed in service in november at december   we owned in excess of of the joint venture that owns this property and we consolidated our ownership of this property 
on march   we purchased all of our joint venture partner s ownership interest in the joint venture that owns this property making us the sole owner of the property 
we also own joint venture interests in two office properties containing an aggregate of million net rentable square feet 
the portfolio also includes approximately acres of developable land and rights to acquire more than additional acres of developable land which management believes could be developed with approximately million rentable square feet of office and industrial space 
however  we do not anticipate commencing new development projects in the near future 
as of december   in terms of net rentable square feet  approximately of our office properties and all of our industrial properties were located in the chicago metropolitan area in prime business locations within established business communities 
our properties located in the chicago metropolitan area accounted for approximately of our rental revenue and of our tenant reimbursements revenue for the year ended december  we own one office property located in cleveland  ohio 
our income is derived primarily from rental revenue including tenant reimbursements from our properties 
we expect that any revenue growth over the next several years will come from revenue generated through increased rental and occupancy rates in the current portfolio 
results of operations as reflected in the table below  property revenues include rental revenues  tenant reimbursements and other property operating revenues 
property operating expenses include real estate taxes  utilities and other property operating expenses 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december the table below represents selected operating information for the total portfolio and for the same store portfolio consisting of office properties and industrial properties acquired or placed in service on or prior to january  total portfolio same store portfolio increase increase dollars in thousands decrease change decrease change property revenues     services company revenues   total revenues     property operating expenses       depreciation and amortization       general and administrative   services company operations    provision for asset impairment      severance costs   strategic alternative costs    other expense   total expenses       operating income       other income    interest expense       amortization of deferred financing costs     loss income from continuing operations before minority interests       minority interests    income loss from continuing operations    discontinued operations  net of minority interests     loss before loss gain on sales of real estate and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle    loss gain on sales of real estate  net of minority interest  cumulative effect of change in accounting principles  net of minority interest net loss    property revenues 
the increase in property revenues resulted primarily from an increase of million in lease termination income to million from million for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively  and the increase of straight line rent in in conjunction with the bankruptcy of a tenant at an industrial property in these increases were partially offset by a decrease in average occupancy of the total portfolio to in from in due to tenant rollover at various properties where the space was not re leased due to the current slowdown in economic activity 
the leading contributor to the decrease was the expiration of a tenant s lease in september at a suburban office property 
even though a portion of this space was subsequently re leased in  this lease expiration accounted for a million decrease in property revenues during we expect that future property revenues may continue to be affected by early lease terminations if economic conditions do not improve or if they worsen 
there is no way to predict the timing or amounts of future lease terminations 
services company revenues 
the increase in services company revenues during was primarily due to our recognition of development fee income of million  which we recognized on a percentage of completion method throughout the year the project was started and completed in  related to the development of a build to suit industrial building 
this increase was partially offset by decreased leasing and consulting income of million and decreased construction and painting revenue of million during due to the company s discontinuance of providing third party brokerage and tenant construction services 
property operating expenses 
the main factor responsible for the increase in property operating expenses during was a million increase in real estate taxes principally resulting from the change in the assessed valuation of two chicago office and two industrial properties 
in addition  property insurance for our total portfolio has increased by million from as a result of the events of september  we believe that these increased costs will remain higher than similar costs incurred in previous periods for the foreseeable future 
we have also experienced an increase in the amount of uncollectible tenant receivables relating to tenant bankruptcies and tenants that are having financial difficulties 
as a result  we may not be able to collect the full amount of rent specified in the affected leases and may incur additional costs in re leasing the space 
the amount of bad debt expense increased by million to million in from million in a lthough we hold security deposits and or letters of credit securing payment of rent from many of our tenants  additional write offs may occur in subsequent periods 
these increases were partially offset by lower utilities expenses in our office properties primarily as a result of lower occupancy levels and efficiencies achieved from changes in service providers 
in addition  general and administrative expenses for our same store portfolio decreased by million from as a result of reallocations of staff responsibilities in conjunction with staffing reductions 
our office properties are leased to tenants either i on a net basis with tenants obligated to pay their proportionate share of real estate taxes  insurance  utility and operating expenses or ii on a gross basis  with the landlord responsible for the payment of these expenses up to the amount incurred during the tenants first year of occupancy base year or a negotiated amount approximating the tenants pro rata share of these expenses expense stop 
the tenants pay their pro rata share of increases in expenses above the base year or expense stop 
most of the leases for our industrial properties are written on either i a net basis  with tenants paying their proportionate share of real estate taxes  insurance  utility and other operating expenses as additional rent or ii a triple net lease basis  with the tenants paying all of the real estate taxes  insurance  utility and other operating expenses for the property 
we believe a portion of any increase in these operating expenses will be offset by expense reimbursements from our tenants 
depreciation and amortization 
the increase of million in depreciation and amortization during compared to was primarily due to additional tenant improvements and lease commissions associated with new leasing at our properties offset by the write off of undepreciated tenant improvements and unamortized lease commissions in associated with a bankrupt tenant at an industrial property 
general and administrative 
for the twelve months ended december  compared to  our general and administrative expenses increased million primarily due to an increase in professional fees and corporate insurance costs which were partially offset by a decrease in salaries and benefits 
services company operations 
the decrease in the services company s operating expenses was primarily due to the elimination of the expenses of operating non core business activities of third party brokerage and tenant construction services which was partially offset by an increase in expenses related to the development services provided to a third party relating to a build to suit industrial building 
provision for asset impairment 
provision for asset impairment for the twelve months ended december  and represents the write down of certain operating properties  development properties and investments in unconsolidated entities to current estimated fair value 
in  we recorded a million asset impairment related to an office property based upon our decision to exit a non core market and a million asset impairment related to an other asset associated with an industrial property as it was determined that the asset no longer had value 
in  we also transferred our interest in a joint venture to our joint venture partner and recorded an asset impairment of million related to our investment in this unconsolidated entity 
we recorded a million asset impairment in to reflect the affect of the then impending assignment of our interest in a development to our joint venture partner based upon our decision not to participate in the development 
severance costs 
for the twelve months ended december   we recorded severance costs of million resulting from the resignations of mr 
reschke and mr 
curto and the reduction of corporate management and support staff 
other income 
the decrease in other income during of million was primarily due to a decrease of million in interest income earned on restricted cash due to lower interest rates and lower restricted cash balances 
a decrease during in income earned from an unconsolidated entity of million also contributed to the overall decrease in other income 
interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense of million in the total portfolio is primarily due to a decrease in interest expense of million due to a decrease in interest rates on our variable rate debt  a decrease of million relating to loan repayments  a decrease of million due to the refinancing of several office and industrial properties  offset by an increase of million for a reduction in the amount of interest capitalized for projects under development and an increase of million related to the notes payable to scpg 
the decrease in interest expense in the same store portfolio resulted primarily from a decrease in interest expense of million due to the refinancing of a cleveland  ohio office property and a decrease of million due to the decrease in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
strategic alternative costs 
these costs consist primarily of professional and investment banking fees 
for the twelve months ended december  compared to  we incurred fewer expenses in connection with our continuing review of strategic alternatives 
discontinued operations 
in accordance with sfas  effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   net income and loss gain on sales of real estate for properties sold subsequent to december  are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as discontinued operations for both periods presented 
impairment losses included in discontinued operations during include million related to assets sold during the second quarter when the anticipated hold period was reduced based upon our decision to sell certain non core suburban office properties and million related to an office property sold during the fourth quarter based upon our decision to exit the tennessee market an impairment loss of million related to this office property was recognized during the fourth quarter of and the related assets were shown as property held for sale at december

the decrease in property revenues in the total portfolio was primarily due to the sale of two chicago office properties during and the related recognition of only a partial year of revenues from these properties 
the increase in property revenues in the same store portfolio resulted primarily from an increase in reimbursable property operating expenses  most notably real estate taxes  which generated significantly higher tenant reimbursements 
same store portfolio property revenues also increased as a result of the renewal of various tenant leases at one chicago office property in which the leases were renewed as net leases for expense reimbursements from gross leases 
these decreases were partially offset by a decrease of million in lease termination income in the same store portfolio to million from million for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively  and the decrease of straight line rent in in conjunction with the bankruptcy of a tenant at an industrial property in services company revenues 
the twelve months ended december  included million of revenues from the services company  a taxable reit subsidiary  which we began to consolidate as of january  mortgage note interest 
mortgage note interest decreased million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in due to the acquisition of the second mortgage note encumbering the office property known as north lasalle street on august  and the property s operations being consolidated as of that date 
property operating expenses 
the main factor responsible for the increase in property operating expenses was primarily associated with a million increase in real estate taxes resulting from the change in the assessed valuation of various office properties 
in addition  property operating expenses increased due to higher hvac repairs and maintenance costs  which also resulted in increased utilities expenses 
we also experienced a million increase in the amount of uncollectible tenant receivables associated with a bankrupt tenant at an industrial property 
overall  the amount of bad debt expense in our same store portfolio increased by million to million in from million in our office properties are leased to tenants either i on a net basis with tenants obligated to pay their proportionate share of real estate taxes  insurance  utility and operating expenses or ii on a gross basis  with the landlord responsible for the payment of these expenses up to the amount incurred during the tenants first year of occupancy base year or a negotiated amount approximating the tenants pro rata share of these expenses expense stop

we believe a portion of any increase in these operating expenses will be offset by expense reimbursements form our tenants 
depreciation and amortization 
the increase of million in depreciation and amortization during compared to was primarily due to additional tenant improvements and lease commissions associated with new leasing at our properties  additional building improvements in conjunction with a suburban office property renovation and the write off of undepreciated tenant improvements and unamortized lease commissions associated with a bankrupt tenant at an industrial property 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense decreased million during the year ended december  primarily due to a decrease in professional fees in services company operations 
the twelve months ended december  included million of expenses from the services company  a taxable reit subsidiary  which we began to consolidate as of january  provision for asset impairment 
provision for asset impairment for the twelve months ended december  represents the write down of certain development properties and an investment in an unconsolidated entity to current estimated fair value 
for the year ended december   the provision for asset impairment represents the write down of a development project to current estimated fair value 
other income 
other income decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in this decrease was primarily due to decreased leasing commission income from bank one corporate center  decreased interest income due to lower interest rates and cash reserves and decreased leasing income due to the consolidation of the office property known as north lasalle street commencing august  interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense of million in the total portfolio is primarily due to a decrease in interest expense of million for an increase in the amount of interest capitalized for projects under development 
the decrease in interest expense of million in the same store portfolio resulted primarily from a decrease in interest expense of million due to the refinancing of a chicago office property and a decrease in interest rates on our floating rate industrial development revenue bonds 
strategic alternative costs 
for the years ended december  and we incurred expenses consisting primarily of professional and investment banking fees in connection with our continuing review of strategic alternatives  which include portfolio asset sales and joint ventures  as well as merger and company sale possibilities 
discontinued operations 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   net income and loss gain on sales of real estate for properties sold subsequent to december  are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as discontinued operations for both periods presented 
liquidity and capital resources recent developments 
on december   we announced that our board approved the engagement of merrill lynch company as our financial advisor to assist in our evaluation of our strategic alternatives  including  but not limited to  a sale  merger or other business combination involving the company  or a sale of some or all of our assets 
in addition  on february  we announced that we engaged wachovia securities as one of our financial advisors in connection with this evaluation 
our goal is to achieve a desirable result for our shareholders which may include a strategic transaction s and or the continued implementation of our primary business strategy  as discussed below 
we have received several expressions of interest from third parties  including interest in pursuing a sale or merger of the company  asset sales  as well as joint venture and recapitalization possibilities  however  there can be no assurances that any transaction or transactions will occur 
we anticipate utilizing net proceeds from any transaction to repay debt and or repurchase our shares and common units of our operating partnership and or distribute them to our shareholders and the common unit holders of our operating partnership 
we may also utilize a portion of any proceeds for general and corporate operating needs and to consummate tax deferred exchanges to minimize any tax exposure under existing tax indemnification agreements 
liquidity 
net cash provided from operations represents our primary source of liquidity to fund distributions  debt service and recurring capital costs 
in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we must distribute of our taxable income excluding capital gains annually 
from our issuance of our series b shares in june through the third quarter of  we paid an annual dividend of per annum per share on each series b share 
due to a number of factors  including our current capital resources and needs  our board decided not to pay a distribution on our common shares units for the fourth quarter of and on our common or preferred shares units for the first two quarters of dividends on our series b shares for the first three quarters of were subsequently declared and paid in connection with the scpg transaction 
see business recent developments for a discussion of the scpg transaction 
under the terms of our indebtedness to scpg  we are not permitted to declare and pay any distributions on our outstanding equity securities so long as the scpg notes remain outstanding  except that we may pay distributions on our series b shares to the extent that we prepay the scpg notes in an amount equal to such distributions 
any additional distributions on our preferred and common shares have currently been suspended by our board and will only be made at our board s discretion 
we currently do not anticipate declaring or paying distributions on our common or preferred shares units during in the future  distributions on our common shares may not be made until all accrued distributions on our preferred shares are declared and paid or set apart for payment 
future distributions will depend on the actual cash available for distribution  our financial condition  capital requirements  the completion of any capital transactions  including refinancings and asset sales  the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code  and such other factors as our board deems relevant 
we can give no assurances that we will be able to complete capital events or  if they are completed  whether they will be on terms that are favorable to us 
we also can give no assurances that if capital events are completed on terms favorable to us or otherwise  distributions on our common shares and common units will be resumed either during or thereafter  or that we will be able to pay dividends on our series b shares 
our anticipated cash flows from operations will not be sufficient to fund our anticipated short and long term capital needs  the payment of preferred distributions  and the payment of quarterly distributions on our common shares units 
in  we anticipate the need to fund significant capital to retenant space that has been vacated or is anticipated to be vacated during in addition  we have incurred and paid  and anticipate to continue to incur and pay  certain costs and expenses related to our bank one corporate center consisting principally of the funding of a sublease obligation in connection with one of the anchor tenant leases 
as noted above  if capital events are not completed on satisfactory terms  we can give no assurances that we will be able to fund our anticipated capital needs 
under the terms of certain debt instruments we executed to obtain modifications to certain loan covenants  we are obligated to fund certain escrow accounts to our lenders 
see note debt covenants to these consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of these escrow obligations 
the financial covenants contained in many of our loan agreements and guarantee agreements with our lenders include minimum ratios for debt service coverage and liabilities as a percentage of total assets  as well as minimum net worth levels  limits as to recourse indebtedness  minimum quarter end cash balance requirements and numerous other financial covenants 
compliance with these covenants in is highly dependent on our financial results including but not limited to a failure of one or more of our significant tenants to pay rent when due and could be impacted by future capital events such as asset sales  debt refinancings and new debt or equity transactions and is not assured 
in some past quarters  we have failed to meet certain of these covenants and after negotiations with our lenders and in certain instances  after agreeing to post additional cash collateral  provide other security and or otherwise modify the terms of the relevant loans we have obtained the necessary loan modifications and or waivers 
we anticipate that as a result of our financial results for the quarter ending march   we may not be in compliance with financial covenants contained in certain of our debt facilities related to minimum quarter end cash balance requirements of million 
our ability to meet these covenants in the future is contingent on our ability to execute certain capital events and on our future financial results 
in addition  if the scpg obligation is not extended  scpg s default remedies  including assuming our operating partnership s equity interests in various properties  may also hinder our ability to meet the minimum quarter end cash requirements and other financial loan covenants 
we are pursuing various capital events  which  if consummated in sufficient amounts  would provide the necessary cash proceeds to meet these covenant requirements in addition to the repayment of part or all of the scpg debt 
if the capital events are not consummated  or the proceeds of capital events are not sufficient to allow us to meet the minimum cash balance covenants  we intend to seek waivers or modifications from the lenders 
there can be no assurances that our financial results will be sufficient to enable us to meet these covenants in the future and  if we do not meet a covenant  whether appropriate loan modifications or waivers can be obtained or if they are obtained  whether they are granted on terms that are favorable to us 
given our current level of debt  limited availability of unencumbered collateral and our current financing arrangements  we may not be able to obtain additional debt financing at interest rates that are below the rates of return on our properties 
in addition  any equity capital we might raise may be dilutive to our current shareholders 
there can be no assurances that we will consummate debt  equity or asset sales transactions which would yield sufficient proceeds in a timeframe necessary to fund our projected operating and capital needs on a current basis 
we are highly dependent on the completion of future capital transactions such as these to fund both our short term and long term liquidity needs 
there can be no assurance as to the completion  timing or terms of any such transactions

b the total contractual obligation for mortgages and notes payable does not reflect unamortized debt discount of million as of december  c the scheduled maturity date for the bonds is the earlier payment due shown here reflects the scheduled expiration of letters of credit which credit enhance the bonds  which if not extended or replaced  would accelerate the maturity of the bonds 
d we have escrows of million that may be utilized to fund these obligations 
e tenant improvement allowances of million correspond to bank one corporate center and will be funded through its construction loan 
we anticipate this obligation will be funded in f these obligations would be offset by any receipts from subleasing of the related space 
we currently have executed subleases that we estimate will provide subleasing receipts of million consisting of base rent and the pro rata share of operating expenses and real estate taxes 
we were obligated  beginning january  to make monthly escrow payments of million per month to an account used to pay the costs associated with citadel s lease of space in bank one corporate center 
we also in pre funded million of these costs into the escrow to be applied to the monthly payments for june  july  august and september of on march   we refinanced the bank one corporate center mezzanine loan and in conjunction with such refinancing  our escrow obligations were restructured 
see recent developments in item business above for further discussion relating to our restructured escrow obligations 
g we have a contract to acquire acres of land for approximately million 
these acres must be purchased by june we are required to make periodic installment payments  of which million and million was paid in and amount included in property held for or under development  respectively

see footnote b below 
b we have a common interest in an unconsolidated real estate joint venture that owns an office tower located at west wacker drive  chicago  illinois 
the amount shown represents of the balance of the million mortgage note payable secured by the property 
on november   the joint venture entered into an interest rate collar agreement for the period from october  through september  with a financial institution for an original notional amount of million 
the interest rate ceiling under the agreement is based on a libor index rate of and the interest floor is based on a libor index rate of 
the million collar agreement required the joint venture to make cash escrow deposits to the extent that the instrument s valuation decreases more than million 
as of december   million was escrowed relating to the million collar agreement 
on march   our joint venture partner became the guarantor to the counterparties related to these collar agreements 
if our joint venture partner  as guarantor  were required to pay either of the counterparties under the terms of the interest rate collar agreements  we have agreed to reimburse our joint venture partner our fifty percent share of any amount paid 
on january   the million collar agreement was assigned to a different financial institution for a fee of million and modified such that the joint venture would need to make cash escrow deposits only to the extent that the instrument s valuation decreases more than million 
as a result  funds previously escrowed were returned to the joint venture 
in addition  we have a interest in a real estate venture  which we account for using the equity method  which owns an office property in phoenix  arizona 
while we are not a guarantor or responsible party  the venture has a million loan secured by the property 
we have not included any amounts related to this loan in this table 
c in february  we sold vacant land in aurora  illinois  a portion of which was covered by the tax indemnity with certain principals affiliated with mr 
nardi the nac contributors  and deposited the proceeds into a tax deferred exchange trust 
in august  we elected not to use the proceeds to acquire a replacement property  thereby triggering the tax gain on sale 
as a result  we have accrued indemnity payments of million to the nac contributors 
we estimate our maximum possible exposure on tax indemnifications to be million if all remaining indemnity properties had been sold as of december  the amount of certain indemnities decreases by each calendar year on each anniversary date of our november  initial public offering 
see tax indemnity agreements and certain relationships and related transactions tax indemnification agreements for further discussion of these indemnities 
d dividends are cumulative and payable at a annual rate each quarter that the series b shares remain outstanding 
the series b shares rank senior to the common shares as to the payment of dividends 
no series b shares dividend was declared or paid for the fourth quarter of on and after june   the series b shares may be redeemed at our option at a redemption price of per share plus accrued and unpaid distributions 
the redemption price is payable solely out of the proceeds from our sale of other capital shares of beneficial interest 
tenant concentration 
the following represents our five largest tenants in based on gross revenue excluding discontinued operations recognized during in thousands of dollars gross of total company tenant revenue tenant revenue arthur andersen  jenner block  national city bank  ibm corporation  trizec properties  inc  on july   arthur andersen notified us that they will be closing their operations and subsequently entered into discussions with us concerning a potential lease termination agreement 
arthur andersen leased an aggregate of  net rentable square feet in two of our office properties  square feet at west monroe street and  square feet at north wabash avenue  which comprise of our total revenue for the year ended december  in february  we entered into lease termination agreements with arthur andersen whereby arthur andersen was released from its remaining lease obligations subsequent to december  at these two properties in exchange for total termination payments of million for the west monroe street lease and million for the north wabash avenue lease 
in addition  the agreements provided we could retain previously paid rent for the month of january we were required by the lenders to deposit the proceeds into escrow accounts for each property 
the million escrow for north wabash avenue is available to fund future tenant improvements and other re leasing costs at the property 
the million escrow for west monroe street may be utilized as follows i up to a maximum of million may be utilized to fund debt service and operating deficits at the west monroe street property  ii million is to be utilized to repay principal on the loan collateralized by the property ninety one days following the receipt of the proceeds  and iii the remainder including any remaining portion of the million discussed under i is available to fund future tenant improvements and other re leasing costs at the property 
in connection with these terminations  we will record termination fee income in the first quarter of of million which represents the above termination payments less outstanding receivables including deferred rent receivable related to these leases 
if one or more of the other tenants listed were to experience financial difficulties and cease paying rent  our cash flow and earnings would likely be negatively impacted in the near term 
the extent and length of this would be impacted by several factors  including o the nature of the financial difficulties  o our ability to obtain control of the space for releasing  o market conditions  o the length of time it would require for us to release the tenant s space  and o whether the tenant s rent was above or below market 
property sales 
during the year ended december   we sold two parcels of land totaling acres  nine suburban office properties totaling approximately million square feet  an office building located in knoxville  tennessee totaling  square feet and an industrial property located in east chicago  indiana totaling  square feet 
we used net proceeds to retire debt  and to fund future and current operations  property capital needs and development activity 
we also deposited a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of land into a tax deferred exchange trust  which was terminated on august  this resulted in million of net proceeds being released to us  and resulted in the accrual of a million payment to mr 
nardi and affiliates of mr 
nardi  under a tax indemnification agreement entered into by us at our initial public offering 
in connection with the knoxville  tennessee sale  we redeemed approximately million of the million of bonds that encumbered the property 
the purchaser assumed the remainder of the outstanding bonds 
the proceeds from the east chicago  indiana sale were deposited into escrow with the lender that provides the credit enhancement for bonds related to the property and other properties 
preferred shares 
our anticipated cash flows from operations in is not anticipated to be sufficient to fund distributions on our series b shares 
payment of these distributions may be dependent on our ability to defer the funding of our capital requirements and or to obtain additional financing and equity capital or to sell assets 
the holders of our series b shares have the right to elect two additional members to our board if six consecutive quarterly distributions on the series b shares are not made 
the term of any trustees elected by the series b shareholders will expire whenever the total dividend arrearage on the series b shares has been paid and current dividends declared and set apart for payment 
under the terms of the scpg transaction  we will not be permitted to declare and pay any distributions on our outstanding equity securities so long as the scpg notes remain outstanding  except that we may pay distributions on our series b shares to the extent that we prepay the notes in an amount equal to such distributions 
tax indemnity agreements 
in connection with the contribution of certain properties during our initial public offering  we entered into tax indemnification agreements with certain principals affiliated with edward s 
hadesman  a former executive officer  and certain principals affiliated with mr 
nardi 
the terms of these agreements are discussed in certain relationships and related transactions tax indemnification agreements 
on december   we purchased and amended the mortgage note encumbering the property known as continental towers located in rolling meadows  illinois 
as part of this transaction  we agreed to indemnify the two limited partners the principals of the limited partnership which owns the property for  among other things  the federal and applicable state income tax liabilities that result from the income or gain which they recognize upon refinancing  sale  foreclosure or other action taken by us with respect to the property or the mortgage note a tax event 
under the terms of the agreement  if an indemnification event  as defined  results in a tax event  we are required to immediately pay to the principals the amount of any resulting federal or state tax  including any interest and penalties  as well as a gross up amount that effectively results in the principals receiving this indemnity payment on a net  after tax basis 
however  if a legal opinion is obtained from independent tax counsel that the indemnification event should not trigger a tax event resulting in taxable income or gain to the principals  no indemnity payment is immediately required 
if the legal opinion obtained from independent tax counsel states that the principals have a reasonable basis for reporting the indemnification event without including any taxable income or gain  no indemnity payment is immediately required 
in either case  the indemnity payment would be required if a tax event occurred 
if a reasonable basis opinion is received regarding an indemnification event and if our equity market capitalization is less than million but more than million  we are required to deposit of the total indemnity amount into an escrow in cash or in the form of a letter of credit 
if i an indemnification event occurs and our equity market capitalization falls below million for more than consecutive trading days or ii immediately after we sell or otherwise dispose of the lesser of million or of our gross assets within a twelve month period a trigger disposition  we desire to cause an indemnification event and our equity market capitalization is less than million  then we will be required to deposit of the total indemnity amount into the escrow 
in addition  in the case of a trigger disposition and our equity market capitalization falls below million  the principals may acquire the general partnership interest in the limited partnership that owns the property for  and be able to prevent the indemnification event from occurring 
the tax indemnity obligation expires january  we estimate that our maximum possible exposure at december  is million 
as discussed above  sales of properties which result in taxable income to parties covered by tax indemnification agreements would create an indemnity obligation on our part to the indemnified party 
in order to mitigate this obligation  we may enter into tax deferred exchange transactions  which would defer the tax sale and related indemnity obligation

funds from operations industry analysis generally consider funds from operations  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  an alternative measure of performance of an equity reit 
funds from operations is defined by nareit as net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable operating property  plus depreciation and amortization other than amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non real estate assets and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
non recurring items  other than those considered extraordinary under gaap  are not adjustments to funds from operations 
while ffo is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of equity reit s  it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by gaap  and it should not be considered as an alternative to these indicators in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our combined historical operating results  funds from operations should be examined in conjunction with net income loss as presented in the unaudited financial statements included elsewhere in this form k

on january   we adopted sfas  as amended by sfas sfas  as amended  established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments 
specifically  sfas requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and to measure those instruments at fair value 
additionally  the fair value adjustments will affect either shareholders equity or net income depending on whether the derivative instrument qualifies as a hedge for accounting purposes and  if so  the nature of the hedging activity 
upon adoption of sfas and sfas  we recorded as a cumulative effect of an accounting change a net transition adjustment unrealized loss of million in net income  and a transition adjustment of million as an increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
adoption of the standard resulted in a net transition adjustment of million on our balance sheet reflected as a million reduction in deferred costs  a million reduction in investment in unconsolidated entities and a deferred hedge liability of million 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued final guidance on the accounting for options used as hedges under sfas this guidance is pursuant to dig g provided certain criteria are met  options can be considered fully effective hedging vehicles  with gains and losses due to changes in market value recorded in other accumulated comprehensive income on our balance sheet 
on september   we adopted g for its interest rate hedge instruments 
any subsequent unrealized gains or losses due to changes in market value of options  such as interest rate caps  will be recorded in the other accumulated comprehensive income 
we compute funds from operations in accordance with standards established by the board of governors of nareit in its april white paper 
in addition to this presentation  we also present funds from operations excluding straight line rental revenue eg  rental revenues based on contractual lease terms  which we believe results in a more accurate presentation of our actual operating activities 
further  funds from operations does not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt repayment obligations  or other commitments and uncertainties 
funds from operations should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss  as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or the ability to pay dividends or make distributions

governor james r 
thompson  one of our trustees  is chairman of the law firm of winston strawn  which has provided  and continues to provide  legal services to us 
winston strawn earned fees of million for legal services provided to us in critical accounting policies general 
the previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about the effects of matters or future events that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates and judgments may affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including contingencies and litigation 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
to assist in understanding our results of operations and financial position  we have identified our critical accounting policies and discussed them below 
these accounting policies are the most important to the portrayal of our results and financial position  either because of the significance of the financial statement items to which they relate or because they require our management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants on an ongoing basis 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts using the specific identification method for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of our tenants to make payments required by the terms of their respective leases 
no general reserve is recorded 
if the financial condition of our tenants were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
deferred tax asset 
we account for income taxes payable by our services company in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december   we had deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of million included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
the deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities decreased approximately million during primarily due to million of pretax income generated by the services company 
we evaluate quarterly the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of the allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax 
we have used tax planning strategies to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
approximately million of future taxable income earned by our services company is ultimately required to realize the net deferred tax assets at december  this is based on the recognition in future years by the services company of taxable income anticipated from certain build to suit activities and management fees earned on two of our properties 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets described above 
factors that may affect our ability to achieve sufficient forecasted taxable income include  but are not limited to  unanticipated decreases in the profitability of build to suit activities and or the sale of properties and subsequent loss of the related management contracts 
assumed lease liabilities 
as a result of the negotiation of certain leases  we assumed the liability for the tenants obligation or agreed to reimburse the tenants for their obligation under leases with their prior landlords 
in addition  in connection with the sale of certain industrial properties in  we agreed to a master lease agreement for certain properties for a defined period 
our policy is to record the estimated net obligation we may be subject to as a liability 
the net obligation is derived by calculating our total contractual obligation and reducing the amount by existing subleases and an estimate of subleases we anticipate signing in the future based on the nature of the space  the property and market conditions 
we periodically review these estimates for reasonableness based on changes in market conditions and executed subleases 
failure to achieve forecasted results could lead to a future increase in the liabilities associated with these transactions 
provisions for impairment 
in evaluating our assets for impairment in accordance with sfas  we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
under sfas  assets that display indicators of possible impairment are reviewed to see if their net book value will be recovered from estimated cash flows over an anticipated hold period 
if these cash flows  plus the proceeds from a sale at the end of the anticipated hold period  are less than the net book value of our related asset  our policy is to record an impairment reserve related to the asset in the amount of the difference between its net book value and our estimate of its fair market value  less costs of sale 
for assets held for sale  impairment is measured as the difference between carrying value and fair value  less cost to dispose 
fair value is based on estimated cash flows discounted at a risk adjusted rate of interest 
property held for future development and property under development are also evaluated for impairment 
impairment is determined for development costs associated with property held for future development and property under development based upon management s assessment that these costs have no future value 
in evaluating our long lived assets used in operations for impairment at december   we assumed anticipated hold periods of three to five years for our operating properties and concluded no reserve was warranted for these properties at this time 
in evaluating our property held for future development and property under development  we concluded that historical and future development expenditures  including capitalized interest  were recoverable and no reserves were warranted at this time 
however  as discussed under liquidity and capital resources  we may need to sell assets to meet our liquidity needs during if our anticipated hold periods for certain assets were shortened  impairment reserves would be required 
these reserves would have significant impacts on our operating results 
capitalization of interest and other costs on development projects 
development costs  which include land acquisition costs  fees and other costs incurred in developing new properties  are capitalized as incurred 
interest  financing costs  real estate taxes  other direct costs and indirect costs including certain employee compensation costs and related general and administrative expenses incurred during development periods are capitalized as a component of the building costs 
these costs continue to be capitalized  to the extent they relate to vacant space  for one year following the date the development is placed in service 
during this one year period  the amount of capitalized costs could be materially affected by the timing and changes in occupancy levels 
subsequent to the one year period  these costs are fully expensed as incurred 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in april  fasb issued sfas in accordance with sfas gains or losses from the early extinguishments of debt would seldom  if ever  result in extraordinary items classification of the gain or loss associated with the extinguishment 
our adoption of sfas during reflects the reclassification of the loss on early extinguishments of debt previously classified as an extraordinary item to amortization of deferred financing costs resulting in a reduction of funds from operations previously reported of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in november  fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others interpretation 
interpretation is an interpretation of sfas no 
 and and incorporates  without change  the guidance of interpretation no 
and clarifies the requirements for proper accounting and disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements regarding obligations under certain guarantees it has issued 
we adopted interpretation in november  which has resulted in additional disclosures in our consolidated financial statements 
in december  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
sfas amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  to provide alternative methods of transition to sfas s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas and accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
while sfas does not amend sfas to require us to account for employee stock options using the fair value method  the disclosure provisions of sfas are applicable to all companies with stock based employee compensation  regardless of whether they account for that compensation using the fair value method of statement or the intrinsic value method of apb opinion no 
we account for our employee common share option grants using the intrinsic method 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities interpretation  which required the consolidation of an entity by an enterprise i if that enterprise  known as a primary beneficiary  has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns if they occur  or both and ii if the entity is a variable interest entity  as defined by interpretation an entity is a variable interest entity if a the total equity investment at risk in the entity is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or b the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest in the entity 
interpretation applies immediately to all variable interest entities created after january  for variable interest entities created by public companies before february   interpretation must be applied no later than the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  the initial determination of whether an entity is a variable interest entity shall be made as of the date at which a primary beneficiary becomes involved with the entity and reconsidered as of the date one of three triggering events described by interpretation occur 
we do not believe that the adoption of this interpretation will have a material effect on our financial statements 
inflation substantially all of our office and industrial leases require tenants to pay  as additional rent  a portion of any increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base amount 
in addition  many of the office and industrial leases provide for fixed increases in base rent or indexed escalations based on the consumer price index or other measures 
we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset  in part  by the expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above 
as of december   approximately million of our outstanding indebtedness was subject to interest at floating rates 
future indebtedness may also be subject to floating rate interest 
the floating rate debt includes million subject to various interest rate cap agreements 
inflation  and its impact on floating interest rates  could affect the amount of interest payments due on such indebtedness
