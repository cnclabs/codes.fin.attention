table of contents company overview we own and operate fm and am radio station clusters serving mid size markets throughout the united states 
we are the second largest radio broadcasting company in the united states based on the number of stations owned or operated 
according to the arbitron s market report  we have assembled market leading groups or clusters of radio stations that rank first or second in terms of revenue share or audience share in substantially all of our markets 
as of december   we owned and operated radio stations in mid sized us media markets 
as of march   we own and operate stations in markets 
in addition  we own and operate a multi market network of five radio stations in the english speaking caribbean 
under our lmas  we provide sales and marketing services for seven radio stations in six us markets in exchange for a management or consulting fee  pending fcc approval of our acquisitions of these stations 
relative to the largest markets in the us  we believe that the mid size markets represent attractive operating environments and generally are characterized by a greater use of radio advertising as evidenced by the greater percentage of total media revenues captured by radio than the national average  rising advertising revenues  as the larger national and regional retailers expand into these markets  small independent operators  many of whom lack the capital to produce high quality locally originated programming or to employ more sophisticated research  marketing  management and sales techniques  and lower overall susceptibility to economic downturns 
we believe that the attractive operating characteristics of mid size markets  together with the relaxation of radio station ownership limits under the telecommunications act of the telecom act and fcc rules  create significant opportunities for growth from the formation of groups of radio stations within these markets 
we believe that mid size radio markets provide an excellent opportunity to acquire attractive properties at favorable purchase prices due to the size and fragmented nature of ownership in these markets and to the greater attention historically given to the larger markets by radio station acquirers 
according to the fcc s records  there are approximately  fm and  am stations in the united states 
to maximize the advertising revenues and station operating income of our stations  we seek to enhance the quality of radio programs for listeners and the attractiveness of our radio stations to advertisers in a given market 
we also increase the amount of locally originated programming content that airs on each station 
within each market  our stations are diversified in terms of format  target audience and geographic location  enabling us to attract larger and broader listener audiences and thereby a wider range of advertisers 
this diversification  coupled with our competitive advertising pricing  also has provided us with the ability to compete successfully for advertising revenue against other radio  print and television media competitors 
we believe that we are in a position to generate revenue growth  increase audience and revenue shares within these markets and  by capitalizing on economies of scale and by competing against other media for incremental advertising revenue  increase our station operating income growth rates and margins to those levels found in large markets 
many of our markets are still in the development stage with the potential for substantial growth as we implement our operating strategy 
strategy we are focused on generating internal growth through improvement in station operating income for the portfolio of stations we operate  while enhancing our station portfolio and our business as a whole  through the acquisition of individual stations or clusters that satisfy our acquisition criteria 

table of contents operating strategy our operating strategy has the following principal components achieve cost efficiencies associated with common infrastructure and personnel and increase revenue by offering regional coverage of key demographic groups that were previously unavailable to national and regional advertisers  develop each station in our portfolio as a unique enterprise  marketed as an individual  local brand with its own identity  programming content  programming personnel  inventory of time slots and sales force  use audience research and music testing to refine each station s programming content to match the preferences of the station s target demographic audience  in order to enrich our listeners experiences by increasing both the quality and quantity of local programming  position station clusters to compete with print and television advertising by combining favorable advertising pricing with diverse station formats within each market to draw a larger and broader listening audience to attract a wider range of advertisers  and employ internet based management information systems that enable us to monitor daily sales performance by station and by market  compared to their respective budgets  to quickly identify any under performing stations  determine the explanation for the under performance and take corrective action quickly 
acquisition strategy our acquisition strategy has the following principal components assemble leading station clusters in the top to radio markets by taking advantage of the size and fragmented nature of ownership in these markets  acquire leading stations in terms of signal coverage  revenue or audience share and acquire under performing stations where there is significant potential to apply our management expertise to improve financial and operating performance  and reconfigure our existing stations  or acquire new stations  located near large markets  that based on an engineering analysis of signal specifications and the likelihood of receiving fcc approval  can be redirected  or moved in  to those larger markets 
acquisitions and dispositions pending acquisitions as of december   the company was a party to various agreements to acquire stations across markets 
the aggregate purchase price of those pending acquisitions is expected to be approximately million  of which million would be paid in cash and million would be paid in shares of the company s common stock

completed dispositions during  the company completed the sale of ten stations in three markets and received approximately million in cash 
in connection with these transactions  the company recorded gains of million  which are presented in other income  net in the accompanying statement of operations for the year ended december  industry overview the primary source of revenues for radio stations is the sale of advertising time to local  regional and national spot advertisers and national network advertisers 
national spot advertisers assist advertisers in placing their advertisements in a specific market 
national network advertisers place advertisements on a national network show and such advertisements will air in each market where the network has an affiliate 
during the past decade  local advertising revenue as a percentage of total radio advertising revenue in a given market has ranged from approximately to 
the growth in total radio advertising revenue tends to be fairly stable 
with the exception of and  when total radio advertising revenue fell by approximately and  respectively  advertising revenue has generally risen in each of the past years faster than both inflation and the gross national product 

table of contents radio is considered an efficient  cost effective means of reaching specifically identified demographic groups 
stations are typically classified by their on air format  such as country  rock  adult contemporary  oldies and news talk 
a station s format and style of presentation enables it to target specific segments of listeners sharing certain demographic features 
by capturing a specific share of a market s radio listening audience  with particular concentration in a targeted demographic  a station is able to market its broadcasting time to advertisers seeking to reach a specific audience 
advertisers and stations use data published by audience measuring services  such as arbitron  to estimate how many people within particular geographical markets and demographics listen to specific stations 
the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listening levels and the resulting ratings are limited in part by the format of a particular station and the local competitive environment 
although the number of advertisements broadcast during a given time period may vary  the total number of advertisements broadcast on a particular station generally does not vary significantly from year to year 
a station s local sales staff generates the majority of its local and regional advertising sales through direct solicitations of local advertising agencies and businesses 
to generate national advertising sales  a station usually will engage a firm that specializes in soliciting radio advertising sales on a national level 
national sales representatives obtain advertising principally from advertising agencies located outside the station s market and receive commissions based on the revenue from the advertising they obtain 
our stations also compete for advertising revenue with other media  including newspapers  broadcast television  cable television  magazines  direct mail  coupons and outdoor advertising 
in addition  the radio broadcasting industry is subject to competition from new media technologies that are being developed or introduced  such as the delivery of audio programming by cable television systems  by satellite and by digital audio broadcasting 
the fcc has authorized two companies to provide satellite digital audio service 
such service delivers by satellite to nationwide and regional audiences  multi channel  multi format  digital radio services with sound quality equivalent to compact discs 
the fcc has also sought public comment on the introduction of terrestrial digital audio broadcasting which is digital audio broadcasting delivered using earth based equipment rather than satellites 
it is not known at this time whether any such digital technology may be used in the future by existing radio broadcast stations  either on existing or alternate broadcasting frequencies 
in addition  as discussed below  the fcc recently authorized a new low power fm service which may compete with our stations for listeners and revenue 
the delivery of radio signals and information through the presently unregulated internet also could create a new form of competition 
the radio broadcasting industry historically has grown despite the introduction of new technologies for the delivery of entertainment and information  such as television broadcasting  cable television  audio tapes and compact discs 
a growing population and greater availability of radios  particularly car and portable radios  have contributed to this growth 
there can be no assurance  however  that the development or introduction in the future of any new media technology will not have an adverse effect on the radio broadcasting industry 
advertising sales virtually all of our revenue is generated from the sale of local  regional and national advertising for broadcast on our radio stations 
approximately  and of our net broadcasting revenue was generated from the sale of local and regional advertising in  and  respectively 
additional broadcasting revenue is generated from the sale of national advertising 
the major categories of our advertisers include automotive dealers telecommunications banking general merchandise retail food services and drinking arts and entertainment healthcare services food and beverage stores furniture and home furnishings each station s local sales staff solicits advertising either directly from the local advertiser or indirectly through an advertising agency 
we employ a tiered commission structure to focus our individual sales staffs on 
table of contents new business development 
consistent with our operating strategy of dedicated sales forces for each of our stations  we have also increased the number of salespeople per station 
we believe that we can outperform the traditional growth rates of our markets by expanding our base of advertisers  training newly hired sales people and providing a higher level of service to our existing customer base 
this requires larger sales staffs than most of the stations employ at the time they are acquired by cumulus 
we support our strategy of building local direct accounts by employing personnel in each of our markets to produce custom commercials that respond to the needs of our advertisers 
in addition  in house production provides advertisers greater flexibility in changing their commercial messages with minimal lead time 
our national sales are made by interep national radio sales  inc  a firm specializing in radio advertising sales on the national level  in exchange for a commission that is based on our net revenue from the advertising obtained 
regional sales  which we define as sales in regions surrounding our markets to buyers that advertise in our markets  are generally made by our local sales staff and market managers 
whereas we seek to grow our local sales through larger and more customer focused sales staffs  we seek to grow our national and regional sales by offering to key national and regional advertisers groups of stations within specific markets and regions that make our stations more attractive 
many of these large accounts have previously been reluctant to advertise in these markets because of the logistics involved in buying advertising from individual stations 
certain of our stations had no national representation before being acquired by us 
during  we were also party to an agreement with jeff mccluskey and associates  inc mccluskey that commenced december  pursuant to the agreement  we designated mccluskey as our exclusive music promotion representative for all of the stations licensed to the company and its subsidiaries in certain specific programming formats identified in the agreement 
under the agreement  in exchange for the right to serve as our independent music promotion representative  mccluskey agreed to compensate the company based upon an agreed upon annual rate per station  varying by programming format for the applicable programming formats represented by mccluskey 
for the years ended december   and  the company recorded revenues of million  million and million  respectively  in accordance with the rates per station specified in the agreement 
consistent with the expiration terms of the agreement  the company terminated its relationship with mccluskey as of december  as of february  the company was in negotiations with several parties in an effort to designate a replacement independent music promotion representative 
the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listening levels and the resulting ratings are limited in part by the format of a particular station 
we estimate the optimal number of advertisements available for sale depending on the programming format of a particular station 
each of our stations has a general target level of on air inventory that it makes available for advertising 
this target level of inventory for sale may be different at different times of the day but tends to remain stable over time 
our stations strive to maximize revenue by managing their on air inventory of advertising time and adjusting prices up or down based on supply and demand 
we seek to broaden our base of advertisers in each of our markets by providing a wide array of audience demographic segments across our cluster of stations  thereby providing each of our potential advertisers with an effective means of reaching a targeted demographic group 
our selling and pricing activity is based on demand for our radio stations on air inventory and  in general  we respond to this demand by varying prices rather than by varying our target inventory level for a particular station 
most changes in revenue are explained by some combination of demand driven pricing changes and changes in inventory utilization rather than by changes in the available inventory 
advertising rates charged by radio stations  which are generally highest during morning and afternoon commuting hours  are based primarily on a station s share of audiences generally  and in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers as measured by ratings surveys  the supply of and demand for radio advertising time generally and for time targeted at particular demographic groups  and certain additional qualitative factors 

table of contents a station s listenership is reflected in ratings surveys that estimate the number of listeners tuned to the station and the time they spend listening 
each station s ratings are used by its advertisers and advertising representatives to consider advertising with the station and are used by cumulus to chart audience growth  set advertising rates and adjust programming 
the radio broadcast industry s principal ratings service is arbitron  which publishes periodic ratings surveys for significant domestic radio markets 
these surveys are our primary source of ratings data 
competition the radio broadcasting industry is highly competitive 
the success of each of our stations depends largely upon its audience ratings and its share of the overall advertising revenue within its market 
our audience ratings and advertising revenue are subject to change  and any adverse change in a particular market affecting advertising expenditures or an adverse change in the relative market positions of the stations located in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on the revenue of our radio stations located in that market 
there can be no assurance that any one or all of our stations will be able to maintain or increase current audience ratings or advertising revenue market share 
our stations  including those to be acquired upon completion of the pending acquisitions  compete for listeners and advertising revenues directly with other radio stations within their respective markets  as well as with other advertising media as discussed below 
radio stations compete for listeners primarily on the basis of program content that appeals to a particular demographic group 
by building a strong brand identity with a targeted listener base consisting of specific demographic groups in each of our markets  we are able to attract advertisers seeking to reach those listeners 
companies that operate radio stations must be alert to the possibility of another station changing its format to compete directly for listeners and advertisers 
another station s decision to convert to a format similar to that of one of our radio stations in the same geographic area or to launch an aggressive promotional campaign may result in lower ratings and advertising revenue  increased promotion and other expenses and  consequently  lower station operating income for cumulus 
factors that are material to a radio station s competitive position include station brand identity and loyalty  management experience  the station s local audience rank in its market  transmitter power and location  assigned frequency  audience characteristics  local program acceptance and the number and characteristics of other radio stations and other advertising media in the market area 
we attempt to improve our competitive position in each market by extensively researching and improving our stations programming  by implementing advertising campaigns aimed at the demographic groups for which our stations program and by managing our sales efforts to attract a larger share of advertising dollars for each station individually 
however  we compete with some organizations that have substantially greater financial or other resources than we do 
changes in federal law and the fcc s rules and policies  which became effective in  permit increased ownership and operation of multiple local radio stations 
management believes that radio stations that elect to take advantage of groups of commonly owned stations or joint arrangements such as lmas may in certain circumstances have lower operating costs and may be able to offer advertisers more attractive rates and services 
although we currently operate multiple stations in each of our markets and intend to pursue the creation of additional multiple station groups  our competitors in certain markets include operators of multiple stations or operators who already have entered into lmas 
we may also compete with other broadcast groups for the purchase of additional stations 
some of these groups are owned or operated by companies that have substantially greater financial or other resources than we do 
although the radio broadcasting industry is highly competitive  and competition is enhanced to some extent by changes in existing radio station formats and upgrades of power  among other actions  certain regulatory limitations on entry exist 
the operation of a radio broadcast station requires a license from the fcc  and the number of radio stations that an entity can operate in a given market is limited by the availability of fm and am radio frequencies allotted by the fcc to communities in that market  as well as by the multiple ownership rules regulating the number of stations that may be owned or programmed by a single entity 
the multiple ownership provisions of the fcc s rules have changed significantly as a result of the 
table of contents telecom act 
for a discussion of fcc regulation and the provisions of the telecom act  see federal regulation of radio broadcasting 
our stations also compete for advertising revenue with other media  including satellite radio see below  newspapers  broadcast television  cable and satellite television  magazines  direct mail  coupons and outdoor advertising 
in addition  the radio broadcasting industry is subject to competition from new media technologies that are being developed or introduced  such as the delivery of audio programming by cable television systems  by satellite and by digital audio broadcasting 
digital audio broadcasting may deliver by satellite to nationwide and regional audiences  multi channel  multi format  digital radio services with sound quality equivalent to compact discs 
the delivery of broadcast signals and information through the presently unregulated internet also could create a new form of competition 
the radio broadcasting industry historically has grown despite the introduction of new technologies for the delivery of entertainment and information  such as television broadcasting  cable television  audio tapes and compact discs 
a growing population and greater availability of radios  particularly car and portable radios  have contributed to this growth 
there can be no assurance  however  that the development or introduction in the future of any new media technology will not have an adverse effect on the radio broadcasting industry 
the fcc has authorized spectrum for the use of a new technology  satellite digital audio radio services satellite radio  to deliver audio programming 
the fcc has authorized two companies to provide such service 
one of these companies recently launched its service  and the other has stated its intention of initiating service in the first quarter of digital audio radio services may provide a medium for the delivery by satellite or terrestrial means of multiple new audio programming formats to local and national audiences 
it is not known at this time whether this digital technology also may be used in the future by existing radio broadcast stations either on existing or alternate broadcasting frequencies 
the fcc also recently approved a new low power fm radio service  and has granted construction permits for low power fm stations to numerous applicants 
under this program  licenses to operate stations in this service are available only to persons or entities that do not currently own fm radio stations 
we cannot predict what effect  if any  the implementation of these services will have on our operations 
low power fm radio stations may  however  cause interference to our stations and compete with our stations for listeners and advertising revenues 
we cannot predict what other matters might be considered in the future by the fcc or the congress  nor can we assess in advance what impact  if any  the implementation of any of these proposals or changes might have on our business 
employees at december   we employed approximately  people 
none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements  and we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory 
we employ several on air personalities with large loyal audiences in their respective markets 
on occasion  we enter into employment agreements with these personalities to protect our interests in those relationships that we believe to be valuable 
the loss of any one of these personalities could result in a short term loss of audience share  but we do not believe that any such loss would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations  taken as a whole 
we generally employ one market manager for each radio market in which we own or operate stations 
each market manager is responsible for all employees of the market and for managing all aspects of the radio operations 
on occasion  we enter into employment agreements with market managers to protect our interests in those relationships that we believe to be valuable 
the loss of any one market manager could result in a short term loss of performance in a market  but we do not believe that any such loss would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations  taken as a whole 

table of contents federal regulation of radio broadcasting introduction 
the ownership  operation and sale of broadcast stations  including those licensed to us  are subject to the jurisdiction of the fcc  which acts under authority derived from the communications act of  as amended the communications act 
the telecommunications act of the telecom act amended the communications act to make changes in several broadcast laws and directed the fcc to change certain of its broadcast rules 
among its other regulatory responsibilities  the fcc issues permits and licenses to construct and operate radio stations  assigns broadcast frequencies  determines whether to approve changes in ownership or control of station licenses  regulates transmission equipment  operating power  and other technical parameters of stations  adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership  operation and employment practices of stations  regulates the content of some forms of radio broadcast programming  and has the authority under the communications act to impose penalties for violations of its rules 
the following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the communications act  the telecom act  and related fcc rules and policies collectively  the communications laws 
this description does not purport to be comprehensive  and reference should be made to the communications laws  public notices  and decisions issued by the fcc for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of radio broadcast stations 
failure to observe the provisions of the communications laws can result in the imposition of various sanctions  including monetary forfeitures and the grant of a short term less than the maximum term license renewal 
for particularly egregious violations  the fcc may deny a station s license renewal application  revoke a station s license  or deny applications in which an applicant seeks to acquire additional broadcast properties 
license grant and renewal 
radio broadcast licenses are granted and renewed for maximum terms of eight years 
licenses are renewed by filing an application with the fcc 
petitions to deny license renewal applications may be filed by interested parties  including members of the public 
we are not currently aware of any facts that would prevent the timely renewal of our licenses to operate our radio stations  although there can be no assurance that our licenses will be renewed 
service areas 
the area served by am stations is determined by a combination of frequency  transmitter power and antenna orientation 
to determine the effective service area of an am station  the station s power  operating frequency  antenna patterns and its day night operating modes are required 
the area served by an fm station is determined by a combination of transmitter power and antenna height  with stations divided into classes according to these technical parameters 
class c fm stations operate with the equivalent of kilowatts of effective radiated power erp at an antenna height of up to  feet above average terrain 
they are the most powerful fm stations  providing service to a large area  typically a substantial portion of a state 
class b fm stations operate with the equivalent of kilowatts erp at an antenna height of up to feet above average terrain 
class b stations typically serve large metropolitan areas as well as their associated suburbs 
class a fm stations operate with the equivalent of kilowatts erp at an antenna height of up to feet above average terrain  and serve smaller cities and towns or suburbs of larger cities 
the minimum and maximum facilities requirements for an fm station are determined by its class 
fm class designations depend upon the geographic zone in which the transmitter of the fm station is located 
in general  commercial fm stations are classified as follows  in order of increasing power and antenna height class a  b  c  b  c  c  c  and c 
the following table sets forth the market  call letters  fcc license classification  antenna elevation above average terrain for fm stations only  power and frequency of all owned and operated stations as of march   all pending station acquisitions operated under an lma agreement as of march  and all pending station acquisitions not operated as of march

kitts nevis  st 
lucia  montserrat and antigua barbuda  and we have been granted licenses for fm stations covering barbados and tortola  british virgin islands 
these eastern caribbean stations are not regulated by the fcc 
regulatory approvals 
the communications laws prohibit the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of a broadcast license without the prior approval of the fcc 
in determining whether to grant an application for assignment or transfer of control of a broadcast license  the communications act requires the fcc to find that the assignment or transfer would serve the public interest 
the fcc considers a number of factors in making this determination  including i compliance with various rules limiting common ownership of media properties  ii the financial and character qualifications of the assignee or transferee including those parties holding an attributable interest in the assignee or transferee  iii compliance with the communications act s foreign ownership restrictions  and iv compliance with other communications laws  including those related to programming and filing requirements 
as discussed in greater detail below  the fcc also reviews the effect of proposed assignments and transfers of broadcast licenses on economic competition and diversity 
see antitrust and market concentration considerations 
ownership matters 
the communications act restricts the company from having more than one fourth of its capital stock owned or voted by non us persons  foreign governments or non us corporations 
we are required to take appropriate steps to monitor the citizenship of our stockholders  such as through 
table of contents representative samplings on a periodic basis  to provide a reasonable basis for certifying compliance with the foreign ownership restrictions of the communications act 
the communications laws also generally restrict i the number of radio stations one person or entity may own  operate or control in a local market  ii the common ownership  operation or control of radio broadcast stations and television broadcast stations serving the same local market  and iii the common ownership  operation or control of a radio broadcast station and a daily newspaper serving the same local market 
none of these multiple and cross ownership rules requires any change in our current ownership of radio broadcast stations or precludes consummation of our pending acquisitions  other than the pending acquisition of one radio station 
the communications laws will limit the number of additional stations that we may acquire in the future in our existing markets as well as new markets 
because of these multiple and cross ownership rules  a purchaser of our voting stock which acquires an attributable interest in the company as discussed below may violate the communications laws if such purchaser also has an attributable or direct interest in other radio or television stations  or in daily newspapers  depending on the number and location of those radio or television stations or daily newspapers 
such a purchaser also may be restricted in the companies in which it may invest to the extent that those investments give rise to an attributable interest 
if an attributable stockholder of cumulus violates any of these ownership rules  we may be unable to obtain from the fcc one or more authorizations needed to conduct our radio station business and may be unable to obtain fcc consents for certain future acquisitions 
the fcc generally applies its television radio newspaper cross ownership rules and its broadcast multiple ownership rules by considering the attributable or cognizable  interests held by a person or entity 
a person or entity will be deemed to hold an attributable interest in a radio station  television station or daily newspaper if the person or entity serves as an officer  director  partner  stockholder  member or  in certain cases  a debt holder of a company that owns that station or newspaper 
whether that interest is subject to the fcc s multiple ownership rules is determined by the fcc s attribution rules 
if an interest is attributable  the fcc treats the person or entity who holds that interest as the owner of the radio station  television station or daily newspaper in question  and that interest thus counts against the person in determining compliance with the fcc s ownership rules 
with respect to a corporation  officers  directors and persons or entities that directly or indirectly hold or more of the corporation s voting stock or more of such stock in the case of insurance companies  investment companies  bank trust departments and certain other passive investors that hold such stock for investment purposes only generally are attributed with ownership of the radio stations  television stations and daily newspapers owned by the corporation 
as discussed below  a local marketing agreement with another station also may result in an attributable interest 
see local marketing agreements 
with respect to a partnership or limited liability company  the interest of a general partner is attributable  as is the interest of any limited partner or limited liability company member who is materially involved in the media related activities of the partnership or limited liability company 
the following interests generally are not attributable i debt instruments  non voting stock  options and warrants for voting stock that have not yet been exercised  ii limited partnership or limited liability company interests where a the limited partner or member is not materially involved in the media related activities of the partnership or limited liability company  and b the limited partnership agreement or limited liability company agreement expressly insulates the limited partner or member from such material involvement  and iii holders of less than of an entity s voting stock 
non voting equity and debt interests which  in the aggregate  constitute or more of a licensee s total equity and debt capitalization are considered attributable in certain circumstances 
programming and operation 
the communications act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest 
broadcasters are required to present programming that is responsive to community problems  needs and interests and to maintain certain records demonstrating such responsiveness 
complaints from listeners concerning a station s programming may be filed at any time and will be considered by the fcc both at the 
table of contents time they are filed and in connection with a licensee s renewal application 
stations also must follow various fcc rules that regulate  among other things  political advertising  the broadcast of obscene or indecent programming  sponsorship identification  the broadcast of contests and lotteries  and technical operations including limits on radio frequency radiation 
failure to observe these or other rules and policies can result in the imposition of various sanctions  including monetary forfeitures  the grant of a short term less than the maximum term license renewal or  for particularly egregious violations  the denial of a license renewal application or the revocation of a station license 
local marketing agreements 
a number of radio stations  including certain of our stations  have entered into what are commonly referred to as local marketing agreements or time brokerage agreements collectively  lmas 
in a typical lma  the licensee of a station makes available  for a fee  airtime on its station to a party which supplies programming to be broadcast during that airtime  and collects revenues from advertising aired during such programming 
lmas are subject to compliance with the antitrust laws and the communications laws  including the requirement that the licensee must maintain independent control over the personnel  programming  and finances of its station 
the fcc has held that such agreements do not violate the communications laws as long as the licensee of the station receiving programming from another station maintains ultimate responsibility for  and control over  station operations and otherwise ensures compliance with the communications laws 
a station that brokers more than of the weekly programming hours on another station in its market will be considered to have an attributable ownership interest in the brokered station for purposes of the fcc s ownership rules 
as a result  a radio station may not enter into an lma that allows it to program more than of the weekly programming hours of another station in the same market that it could not own under the fcc s multiple ownership rules 
new services 
in  the fcc awarded two licenses to separate entities that authorize the licensees to provide satellite delivered digital audio radio services 
both licensees have launched their respective satellite delivered digital radio service 
digital technology also may be used by terrestrial radio broadcast stations on their existing frequencies 
in october  the fcc released a report and order in which it selected in band  on channel iboc as the technology that will permit terrestrial radio stations to introduce digital operations 
the fcc now will permit operating radio stations to commence digital operation immediately on an interim basis using the iboc systems developed by ibiquity digital corporation 
the fcc deferred consideration of formal standard setting procedures and related broadcast licensing and service rules to a future rulemaking proceeding 
in january  the fcc released a report and order adopting rules for a new low power fm radio service consisting of two classes of stations  one with a maximum power of watts and the other with a maximum power of watts 
the fcc has limited ownership and operation of low power fm stations to persons and entities which do not currently have an attributable interest in any fm station and has required that low power fm stations be operated on a non commercial educational basis 
the fcc has granted numerous construction permits for low power fm stations 
we cannot predict what impact low power fm radio will have on our operations 
adverse effects of the new low power fm service on our operations could include interference with our stations and competition by low power stations for listeners and revenues 
in addition  from time to time congress and the fcc have considered  and may in the future consider and adopt  new laws  regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could  directly or indirectly  affect the operation  ownership and profitability of our radio stations  result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenues for our radio stations  and affect the ability of cumulus to acquire additional radio stations or finance such acquisitions 
the foregoing is a brief summary of certain provisions of the communications laws 
this description does not purport to be comprehensive  and reference should be made to the communications laws as well as public notices and rulings of the fcc for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of radio broadcast stations 

table of contents antitrust and market concentration considerations 
potential future acquisitions  to the extent they meet specified size thresholds  will be subject to applicable waiting periods and possible review under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of  as amended hsr act  by the department of justice or the federal trade commission  either of whom can be required to evaluate a transaction to determine whether that transaction should be challenged under the federal antitrust laws 
transactions are subject to the hsr act only if the acquisition price or fair market value of the stations to be acquired is million or more 
most of our acquisitions have not met this threshold 
acquisitions that are not required to be reported under the hsr act may still be investigated by the department of justice or the federal trade commission under the antitrust laws before or after consummation 
at any time before or after the consummation of a proposed acquisition  the department of justice or the federal trade commission could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary  including seeking to enjoin the acquisition or seeking divestiture of the business acquired or certain of our other assets 
the department of justice has reviewed numerous radio station acquisitions where an operator proposes to acquire additional stations in its existing markets or multiple stations in new markets  and has challenged a number of such transactions 
some of these challenges have resulted in consent decrees requiring the sale of certain stations  the termination of lmas or other relief 
in general  the department of justice has more closely scrutinized radio mergers and acquisitions resulting in local market shares in excess of of local radio advertising revenues  depending on format  signal strength and other factors 
there is no precise numerical rule  however  and certain transactions resulting in more than revenue shares have not been challenged  while certain other transactions may be challenged based on other criteria such as audience shares in one or more demographic groups as well as the percentage of revenue share 
we estimate that we have more than a share of radio advertising revenues in many of our markets 
we are aware that the department of justice commenced  and subsequently discontinued  investigations of several proposed acquisitions by cumulus 
the department of justice can be expected to continue to enforce the antitrust laws in this manner  and there can be no assurance that one or more of our pending or future acquisitions are not or will not be the subject of an investigation or enforcement action by the department of justice or the federal trade commission 
similarly  there can be no assurance that the department of justice  the federal trade commission or the fcc will not prohibit such acquisitions  require that they be restructured  or in appropriate cases  require that the company divest stations it already owns in a particular market 
in addition  private parties may under certain circumstances bring legal action to challenge an acquisition under the antitrust laws 
as part of its review of certain radio station acquisitions  the department of justice has stated publicly that it believes that commencement of operations under lmas  joint sales agreements and other similar agreements customarily entered into in connection with radio station ownership transfers prior to the expiration of the waiting period under the hsr act could violate the hsr act 
in connection with acquisitions subject to the waiting period under the hsr act  we will not commence operation of any affected station to be acquired under an lma or similar agreement until the waiting period has expired or been terminated 
in addition  where acquisitions would result in certain local radio advertising revenue concentration thresholds being met  the fcc staff has a policy of reviewing applications for proposed radio station acquisitions with respect to local market concentration concerns 
the fcc places a specific notation on the public notices with respect to proposed radio station acquisitions that it believes may raise local market concentration concerns  invites public comment on such matters  and in some cases may request additional information with respect to such acquisitions 
specifically  the fcc staff has stated publicly that it will review proposed acquisitions with respect to local radio market concentration if publicly available sources indicate that  following such acquisitions  one party would receive or more of the radio advertising revenues in such local radio market  or that any two parties would together receive or more of such revenues  notwithstanding that the proposed acquisitions would comply with the station ownership limits in the telecom act and the fcc s multiple ownership rules 
those public notices on possible concentration of radio advertising revenue may help trigger petitions to deny and informal objections against fcc applications for certain pending acquisitions and future acquisitions 

table of contents the fcc has  from time to time  placed such notations on the public notices issued with respect to a number of cumulus applications and has conducted such reviews with respect to certain of these applications 
in addition  the fcc is currently conducting a comprehensive examination of its rules and policies concerning local radio ownership  including its treatment of lmas and joint sales agreements 
as part of its review  the fcc adopted an interim policy for processing applications which propose acquisitions that would result in advertising revenue concentrations meeting or exceeding the levels described above 
this interim policy involves analysis by the fcc of a number of factors designed to determine the impact of the proposed acquisition on competition 
the fcc requested that we address these factors with respect to the company s acquisitions of stations in the columbus starkville  mississippi market and the sale of stations in the columbus  georgia market 
we cannot predict what action the fcc may take in the pending rulemaking proceeding  the actions which may result from its interim policy  or what effect any such action might have on the company 
however  if the fcc were to adopt more restrictive policies regarding market concentration or lmas  the fcc s action could further limit the number of stations we are permitted to own or program in a single market  and could limit our ability to sell all of the stations we own in certain markets to a single purchaser  which could diminish the value of those markets to potential acquirers 
in the meantime  petitions to deny were filed against the company s acquisitions in the columbus starkville  mississippi  and columbus  georgia markets 
both of the petitions were based on allegations regarding market concentration or the company s other alleged non compliance with the communications laws 
the fcc denied both petitions and the company consummated the related transactions 
however  the petitioner in the columbus starkville matter filed a reconsideration petition with the fcc which is still pending  and the petitioner in the columbus  georgia matter filed an appeal with the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit which is still pending 
also pending before the fcc is an objection to the company s proposal to modify the fcc license for fm radio station kgee in monahans  texas 
the objection is based on an allegation that the modification violates the communications laws because it is allegedly designed only to permit the company s acquisition of another radio station in the market 
the company does not believe that any adverse decision in any of the foregoing matters will pose a risk of a material adverse impact on the overall operations of the company taken as a whole 
as part of its pending review of the radio ownership rules  the fcc proposed to modify the manner in which it defines a radio market for purposes of the local radio station ownership limits in the communications laws 
if the fcc modifies the manner in which a radio market is defined it potentially could reduce the number of stations that cumulus would be allowed to acquire in some markets  and could limit our ability to sell all of the stations we own in certain markets to a single purchaser  which could diminish the value of those markets to potential acquirers

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of the key factors that have affected our business since its inception on may  you should read the following information in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f in this form k 
this 
table of contents discussion contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results  performance or achievements could differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  these forward looking statements 
accordingly  we cannot be certain that any of the events anticipated by the forward looking statements will occur or  if any of them do  what impact they will have on us 
overview for the period from our inception through december   we have acquired or entered into local marketing  management and consulting agreements with radio stations throughout the united states and the caribbean 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations includes the results of these acquisitions and local marketing  management and consulting agreements 
as of december   we owned and operated stations in us markets and provided sales and marketing services under local marketing  management and consulting agreements to stations in us markets  pending fcc approval of the acquisition of these stations 
we currently own five stations and have obtained a license to commence operations on one station in the caribbean market 
we are the second largest radio broadcasting company in the united states based on number of stations 
we believe we are the eighth largest radio broadcasting company in the united states by net revenues  based on our pro forma net revenues 
we will own and operate a total of radio stations in us markets upon fcc approval and consummation of all pending acquisitions and divestitures exclusive of new market move in opportunities 
advertising revenue and station operating income our primary source of revenues is the sale of advertising time on our radio stations 
our sales of advertising time are primarily affected by the demand for advertising time from local  regional and national advertisers and the advertising rates charged by our radio stations 
advertising demand and rates are based primarily on a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers  as measured principally by arbitron on a periodic basis  generally two or four times per year 
because audience ratings in local markets are crucial to a station s financial success  we endeavor to develop strong listener loyalty 
we believe that the diversification of formats on our stations helps to insulate them from the effects of changes in the musical tastes of the public with respect to any particular format 
the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listening levels and the resulting rating is limited in part by the format of a particular station 
our stations strive to maximize revenue by constantly managing the number of commercials available for sale and adjusting prices based upon local market conditions 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations sometimes utilize trade or barter agreements that exchange advertising time for goods or services such as travel or lodging  instead of for cash 
our use of trade agreements resulted in immaterial operating income expense during the years ended december   and of million  million and million  respectively 
we continually seek to minimize our use of trade agreements 
our advertising contracts are generally short term 
we generate most of our revenue from local and regional advertising  which is sold primarily by a station s sales staff 
during the years ended december   and approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues were from local advertising 
to generate national advertising sales  we engage interep national radio sales  inc  a national representative company 
our revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  we expect our first calendar quarter will produce the lowest revenues for the year  and the second and fourth calendar quarters will generally produce the highest revenues for the year  with the exception of certain of our stations  such as those in myrtle beach  south carolina  where the stations generally earn higher revenues in the second and third quarters of the year because of the higher seasonal population in those communities 
our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that typically do not have an effect on revenue generation until future periods  if at all 

table of contents our most significant station operating expenses are employee salaries and commissions  programming expenses  advertising and promotional expenditures  technical expenses  and general and administrative expenses 
we strive to control these expenses by working closely with local market management 
the performance of radio station groups  such as ours  is customarily measured by the ability to generate station operating income 
see the quantitative reconciliation of station operating income to the accompanying financial statement that follows in this section

certain long lived assets were determined to be impaired because the carrying amounts of the assets exceeded the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be derived from the assets 
these impairment losses were measured as the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceeded the fair values of the assets  determined based on the discounted future cash flows expected to be derived from the assets

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible assets and specifically identified intangible assets 
although intangible assets are recorded in the company s financial statements at amortized cost  we believe that such assets  especially broadcast licenses  can significantly appreciate in value by successfully executing the company s operating strategies 
during   and  the company has recognized gains from the sale of stations 
we believe these gains indicate that certain internally generated intangible assets  which are not recorded for accounting purposes  can significantly increase the value of our portfolio of stations over time

the resulting impairment charges totaled million  consisting of a million charge to write off goodwill and the related broadcast license  and a million charge to write down property and equipment 
for the year ended december   net revenue and operating loss prior to the impairment charge of the company s caribbean operations were million and million  respectively 
during june the company implemented two separate board approved restructuring programs to i focus the company s operations on its core business  radio broadcasting  by terminating several internet service pilot projects and internet infrastructure development projects  and ii make the company s corporate infrastructure more efficient and responsive to our markets by relocating effective october   all corporate services that had been conducted in milwaukee  wisconsin and chicago  illinois to atlanta  georgia 
total costs incurred as a result of the restructuring programs were million  which included severance and related charges associated with the reduction in force  charges related to vacating leased facilities  impaired leasehold improvements at vacated leased facilities  and impaired assets related to the internet businesses 
in connection with the continued strategic initiative to focus on its core radio business  the company also conducted a review of certain non radio operations during the fourth quarter of this strategic review triggered an impairment review of the long lived assets of these operations  and it was determined that the carrying value of certain long lived assets exceeded the projected undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by such assets 
the estimated future net cash flows were estimated based on present levels of sales volume  because the company does not expect to devote significant funding to the development of products and services provided by these non radio operations in the future 
accordingly  the company recorded a million impairment write down consisting of the following i a million impairment charge to write off goodwill of broadcast software international  inc  referred to as bsi  and ii a million impairment charge to write off the net assets of its wholly owned subsidiary  the advisory board of nevada

further  we use ebitda  as defined above  as one of the key measurements of operating efficiency  overall financial performance and profitability 
conceptually  ebitda measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt  pay taxes and fund capital expenditures because ebitda is independent of the actual leverage employed by the business 
nevertheless  it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  operating income loss  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure for determining the company s operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with gaap 
ebitda differs significantly from cash flows from operating activities 
cash flows from operating activities is net of interest and lma fees paid and is a more comprehensive determination of periodic income on a cash basis 
in contrast  ebitda is derived from accrual basis income and is not adjusted for cash invested in working capital

pro forma net revenues for the year ended december  decreased to million 
pro forma station operating expenses excluding depreciation  amortization and lma fees for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease in pro forma net revenues from to is due to lower sales volume associated with the company s implementation of stringent credit and collections policies and the current economic slowdown and tightening corporate advertising budgets  which has impacted the entire broadcast industry 
the majority of the decrease in pro forma station operating expenses excluding depreciation  amortization and lma fees is due to expense reductions achieved as a result of improved management control of cost of sale and other operating expense saving initiatives 
seasonality the company expects that its operations and revenues will be seasonal in nature  with generally lower revenue generated in the first quarter of the year and generally higher revenue generated in the second and fourth quarters of the year 
the seasonality of the company s business reflects the adult orientation of the company s formats and relationship between advertising purchases on these formats with the retail cycle 
this seasonality causes and will likely continue to cause a variation in the company s quarterly operating results 
such variations could have an effect on the timing of the company s cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources our principal need for funds has been to fund the acquisition of radio stations and  to a lesser extent  working capital needs  capital expenditures  repurchases of our outstanding series a preferred stock and notes  and interest and debt service payments 
our principal sources of funds for these requirements have been cash flow from operations and cash flow from financing activities  such as the proceeds from offerings of our securities and borrowings under credit agreements 
our principal need for funds in the future is expected to include the need to fund future acquisitions  interest and debt service payments  working capital needs and capital expenditures 
we believe that our presently projected cash flow from operations and present financing arrangements  including availability under the existing credit facility  or borrowings that would be available from future financing arrangements  will be sufficient to meet our future capital needs  including the funding 
table of contents of pending acquisitions  operations and debt service 
however  our cash flow from operations is subject to such factors as shifts in population  station listenership  demographics or audience tastes  and borrowings under financing arrangements are subject to financial covenants that can restrict our financial flexibility 
further  our ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing is also subject to market conditions and operating performance 
as such  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing at terms  and on the timetable  that may be necessary to meet our future capital needs 
see risk factors 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operations increased million  to million  from million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to increased operating income 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities increased million  to million  from million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to an increase in acquisition activity during the current year 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities increased million  to million  from million during the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities in the current year was primarily the result of net borrowings under the company s new credit facility entered into in march million and the proceeds of the company s offering of shares of its class a common stock on may  million 
cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by a cash paid to repurchase  shares of our series a preferred stock million  b cash paid to repurchase million in aggregate principal of the notes and c cash dividends paid on our series a preferred stock million

pending acquisitions 
as of december   the company was a party to various agreements to acquire stations across markets 
the aggregate purchase price of those pending acquisitions is expected to be approximately million  of which million would be paid in cash and million would be paid in shares of the company s common stock 
as of february   the company was a party to agreements to acquire eight stations across seven markets 
the february  pending acquisition station totals reflect the completion of the previously announced ft

we intend to fund the cash portion of the pending acquisitions with cash on hand  cash flow from operations  the proceeds of our credit facility or future credit facilities  and other to be identified sources 
as of december  and february   million of escrow deposits were outstanding related to pending transactions 
in the event that the company is unable to obtain financing necessary to consummate those remaining pending acquisitions  the company could be liable for approximately million in purchase price 
we expect to consummate most of our pending acquisitions during  although there can be no assurance that the transactions will be consummated within that time frame  or at all 
in three of the markets in which there are pending acquisitions petitions to deny have been filed against the company s fcc assignment applications 
all such petitions and fcc staff inquiries must be resolved before fcc approval can be obtained and the acquisitions consummated 
in addition  from time to time the company completes acquisitions following the initial grant of an assignment application by the fcc staff but before such grant becomes a final order  and a petition to review such a grant may be filed 
there can be no assurance that such grants may not ultimately be reversed by the fcc or an appellate court as a result of such petitions  which 
table of contents could result in the company being required to divest the assets it has acquired 
the ability of the company to make future acquisitions in addition to the pending acquisitions is dependent upon on the company s ability to obtain additional equity and or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such financing

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on 
table of contents historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers when the commercials are broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company determines the allowance based on historical write off experience and trends 
the company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts monthly 
past due balances over days are reviewed individually for collectibility 
all other balances are reviewed and evaluated on a pooled basis 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
although management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts is the company s best estimate of amount of probable credit losses  if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in connection with the elimination of amortization of broadcast licenses upon the adoption of sfas no 
 the reversal of the company s deferred tax liabilities relating to those intangible assets is no longer assured within the company s net operating loss carry forward period 
as a result  the company determined it was necessary to establish a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets and recorded a million non cash charge to income tax expense for the three months ended march  the company has also recorded additional deferred tax expense of million to establish a valuation allowance against net operating loss carry forwards generated during the twelve months ended december   resulting from amortization of goodwill and broadcast licenses that is deductible for tax purposes  but is no longer amortized in the financial statements 
should the company determine that it would be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  reduction of the valuation allowance would be recorded in income in the period such determination was made 
the company has significant intangible assets recorded in its accounts 
these intangible assets are comprised primarily of broadcast licenses and goodwill assets acquired through the acquisition of radio stations 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  that requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets will not be amortized 
instead  these assets will be reviewed at least annually for impairment and charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than its fair value 
the fair value of these assets is dependent upon the performance of our stations 
in assessing the recoverability of our indefinite lived intangible assets  we must conduct annual impairment testing required by sfas no 
 which could result in our being required to write down the carrying value of our broadcasting licenses and goodwill in future periods 
we completed the transitional intangible assets with indefinite lives impairment test for broadcast licenses and recorded to the statement of operations  a million impairment charge  net of deferred tax benefit of million  under the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended december  we also completed the transitional impairment test of goodwill and determined that the carrying amount for each of our reporting units did not exceed the fair value and  as such  did not record a goodwill impairment charge 
as of december   we had recorded  million in intangible assets  which represented approximately of our total assets

intangibles as of december   approximately of our total assets consisted of intangible assets  such as radio broadcast licenses and goodwill  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our business 
we could not operate the radio stations without the related fcc license for each station 
fcc licenses are renewed every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations to ensure they comply with all regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods  and we expect that all licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 

table of contents risk factors many statements contained in item and elsewhere in this report are forward looking in nature 
these statements are based on current plans  intentions or expectations and actual results could differ materially as we cannot guarantee that we will achieve these plans  intentions or expectations 
risks related to our business we operate in a very competitive business environment 
radio broadcasting is a highly competitive business 
our stations compete for listeners and advertising revenues directly with other radio stations within their respective markets  as well as with other media  such as newspapers  magazines  cable and broadcast television  outdoor advertising  the internet and direct mail 
in addition  many of our stations compete with groups of two or more radio stations operated by a single operator in the same market 
audience ratings and market shares fluctuate  and any adverse change in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on the revenue of stations located in that market 
while we already compete with other stations with comparable programming formats in many of our markets  any one of our stations could suffer a reduction in ratings or revenue and could require increased promotion and other expenses  and  consequently  could have a lower broadcast cash flow  if another radio station in the market were to convert its programming format to a format similar to our station or launch aggressive promotional campaigns  a new station were to adopt a competitive format  or an existing competitor were to strengthen its operations 
the telecom act allows for the consolidation of ownership of radio broadcasting stations in the markets in which we operate or may operate in the future 
some competing consolidated owners may be larger and have substantially more financial and other resources than we do 
in addition  increased consolidation in our target markets may result in greater competition for acquisition properties and a corresponding increase in purchase prices paid for these properties by us 
we must respond to the rapid changes in technology  services and standards that characterize our industry in order to remain competitive 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and the emergence of competition from new media technologies and services 
we cannot assure you that we will have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with these new technologies 
several new media technologies and services are being developed or introduced  including satellite delivered digital audio radio service  which has resulted in the introduction of new subscriber based satellite radio services with numerous niche formats  audio programming by cable systems  direct broadcast satellite systems  personal communications systems  internet content providers and other digital audio broadcast formats  in band on channel digital radio  which provides multi channel  multi format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional am and fm radio services  and low power fm radio  which could result in additional fm radio broadcast outlets 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that competition arising from new technologies or regulatory change may have on the radio broadcasting industry or on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we face many unpredictable business risks that could have a material adverse effect on our future operations 
our future operations are subject to many business risks  including certain risks that specifically influence the radio broadcasting industry  that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
these include changing economic conditions  both generally and relative to the radio broadcasting industry in particular  shifts in population  listenership  demographics or audience tastes  the level of competition from existing or future technologies for advertising revenues  including  but not limited to  other radio stations  satellite radio  television stations  newspapers  the internet  and other entertainment and communications media  and changes in governmental regulations and policies and actions of federal regulatory bodies  including the us department of justice  the federal trade commission and the fcc 
given the inherent unpredictability of these variables  we cannot with any degree of certainty predict what effect  if any  these risks will have on our future operations 
there are risks associated with our acquisition strategy 
we intend to continue to grow through internal expansion and by acquiring radio station clusters and individual radio stations primarily in mid size markets 
we cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing these acquisitions or what the consequences of these acquisitions would be 
consummation of our pending acquisitions and any acquisitions in the future are subject to various conditions  such as compliance with fcc and antitrust regulatory requirements 
the fcc requirements include approval of license assignments and transfers  limits on the number of stations a broadcaster may own in a given local market  and other rules or policies  such as the ownership attribution rules  that could limit our ability to acquire stations in certain markets where one or more of our stockholders has other media interests 
the antitrust regulatory requirements include filing with the us department of justice and the federal trade commission under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of  referred to as the hsr act  where applicable  expiration or termination of the waiting period under the hsr act  and possible review by the us department of justice or the federal trade commission of antitrust issues under the hsr act or otherwise 
we cannot be certain that any of these conditions will be satisfied 
in addition  the fcc has asserted the authority to review levels of local radio market concentration as part of its acquisition approval process  even where proposed assignments would comply with the numerical limits on local radio station ownership in the fcc s rules and the communications act of  referred to as the communications act 
our acquisition strategy involves numerous other risks  including risks associated with identifying acquisition candidates and negotiating definitive purchase agreements on satisfactory terms  integrating operations and systems and managing a large and geographically diverse group of stations  diverting management s attention from other business concerns  potentially losing key employees at acquired stations  and the diminishing number of properties available for sale in mid size markets 

table of contents we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions or manage the resulting business effectively  or that any acquisition will achieve the benefits that we anticipate 
in addition  we are not certain that we will be able to acquire properties at valuations as favorable as those of previous acquisitions 
depending upon the nature  size and timing of potential future acquisitions  we may be required to raise additional financing in order to consummate additional acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that our debt agreements will permit the necessary additional financing or that additional financing will be available to us or  if available  that financing would be on terms acceptable to our management 
because a significant portion of our total assets is represented by intangible assets and goodwill that is subject to mandatory  annual impairment evaluations  we have written off  and could in the future be required to write off  a significant portion of these assets  which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we have acquired businesses that have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
a portion of the purchase prices for these businesses was allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets  principally fcc broadcast licenses  based on estimated fair values at the dates of the acquisitions 
any excess purchase price was allocated to goodwill 
prior to january   the cost of fcc broadcast licenses and goodwill was amortized using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of years 
effective january   upon the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  fcc broadcast licenses and goodwill are no longer amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
at december   we had recorded  as unamortized values  million of fcc broadcast licenses and million of goodwill 
as required by the transition provisions of sfas no 
 we compared the estimated fair values of our fcc broadcast licenses to the book values by market and  as a result of the comparison  took a charge in the first quarter of of million  net of taxes 
in connection with sfas no 
s transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  the statement required us to perform an assessment of whether there was an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  we were required to identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of january  we were required to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit within six months of january  to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of the reporting unit  we would be required to perform the second step of the transitional impairment test  as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired 
based on the results of its first step test  we were not required to perform the second step test on any of our reporting units 
however  there can be no assurance that there will not be further adjustments for impairment in future periods 
in connection with the elimination of amortization of the cost of our broadcast licenses for financial reporting purposes upon the adoption of sfas no 
 the reversal of our deferred tax liabilities relating to those intangible assets is no longer assured within our net operating loss carry forward period 
as a result  we determined it was necessary to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and we recorded a million non cash charge to income tax expense during the first quarter of in addition to this change  we established a valuation allowance of million against deferred tax assets created when certain broadcast licenses were written down as a result of the transitional impairment test for broadcast licenses upon the adoption of sfas no 
the company has also recorded additional deferred tax expense of million to establish a valuation allowance against net operating loss carry forwards generated during the year ended december   resulting from amortization of goodwill and broadcast licenses that is deductible for tax purposes  but is no longer amortized in the financial statements 
our management has determined that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets  net of the existing valuation allowances  at december  our ability to generate revenue could be affected by economic recession 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of advertising time on our radio stations 
generally  advertising tends to decline during economic recessions or downturns 
furthermore  because a 
table of contents substantial portion of our revenue is derived from local advertisers  our ability to generate advertising revenue in specific markets is directly affected by local or regional economic conditions 
a continued recession  or a downturn in the us economy  or in the economy of any individual geographic market in which we own or operate stations  could have a significant effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we are dependent on key personnel 
our business is managed by a small number of key management and operating personnel  and our loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel and to expand  train and manage our employee base 
we have entered into employment agreements with some of our key management personnel that include provisions restricting their ability to compete with us under specified circumstances 
we also employ several on air personalities with large loyal audiences in their individual markets 
the loss of one of these personalities could result in a short term loss of audience share in that particular market 
the broadcasting industry is subject to extensive and changing federal regulation 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the fcc under the communications act 
we are required to obtain licenses from the fcc to operate our stations 
licenses are normally granted for a term of eight years and are renewable 
although the vast majority of fcc radio station licenses are routinely renewed  we cannot assure you that the fcc will approve our future renewal applications or that the renewals will not include conditions or qualifications 
the non renewal  or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications  of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on us 
we must also comply with the extensive fcc regulations and policies in the ownership and operation of our radio stations 
fcc regulations limit the number of radio stations that a licensee can own in a market  which could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and in certain circumstances could require us to divest some radio stations 
the fcc also requires radio stations to comply with certain technical requirements to limit interference between two or more radio stations 
if the fcc relaxes these technical requirements  the signals transmitted by our radio stations could be impaired by other radio stations  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
moreover  these fcc regulations and others may change over time and we cannot assure you that those changes would not have a material adverse effect on us 
we are required to obtain prior fcc approval for each radio station acquisition 
the consummation of radio station acquisitions requires prior approval of the fcc with respect to the transfer of control or assignment of the broadcast licenses of the acquired stations 
the fcc could prohibit or require the restructuring of our future acquisitions  or could propose changes in its existing rules that may reduce the number of stations that we would be permitted to acquire in some markets 
in addition  where acquisitions would result in certain local radio advertising revenue concentration thresholds being met  the fcc staff has a policy of reviewing applications for proposed radio station acquisitions with respect to local market concentration concerns  and specifically invites public comment on these applications 
this policy may help trigger petitions to deny and informal objections against fcc applications for our pending acquisitions and future acquisitions  as well as fcc staff requests for additional information 
there can be no assurance that the fcc will approve potential future acquisitions 
risks related to our indebtedness we have substantial indebtedness that could have a material adverse effect on us 
as of december   and after giving effect to the completion of our recent acquisitions of aurora communications and the broadcasting operations of dbbc  and the related refinancings  our long term debt was million  representing approximately of our stockholders equity 
our debt agreements  and 
table of contents the terms of our outstanding preferred stock  have interest and principal repayment and redemption obligations that are substantial in amount and would have a substantial impact on our stockholders 
the level of our indebtedness could have several important consequences to you 
you should note that a substantial portion of our cash flow is  and will be  dedicated to debt service and is not  and will not be  available for other purposes  our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes may be impaired in the future  certain of our borrowings are  and will be  at variable rates of interest  which will expose us to the risk of increased interest rates  our leveraged position and the covenants contained in our debt agreements and the terms of our outstanding preferred stock could limit our ability to compete  expand or make capital improvements  and our level of indebtedness could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns  limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions 
our ability to fulfill our debt obligations could be adversely affected by many factors 
our ability to repay our debt obligations will depend upon our future financial and operating performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial  business  competitive  technological  legislative and regulatory factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot be certain that our operating results  cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient to repay our debt and other obligations in the future 
in the absence of sufficient operating results and resources  we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be required to reduce or delay planned acquisitions  expansions and capital expenditures  sell material assets or operations  obtain additional equity capital  or restructure our debt 
if liquidity problems require us to take any of these actions  we cannot provide you any assurance as to the timing of any sales or the proceeds that we could realize from these sales  our ability to obtain additional equity capital or successfully complete a restructuring of our debt  or whether these sales  additional equity capital or restructuring of debt could be effected on terms satisfactory to us or at all 
our debt agreements and the terms of our preferred stock impose significant restrictions on us 
our debt agreements  and the terms of our outstanding preferred stock  restrict  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  make particular types of investments or make other restricted payments  enter into some types of transactions with affiliates  merge or consolidate with any other person  or sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  our debt agreements also restrict our ability to incur liens or to sell some assets 
our credit facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and to satisfy certain financial condition tests 
our ability to meet those financial ratios and financial condition tests can be affected by events beyond our 
table of contents control  and we cannot be sure that we will maintain those ratios or meet those tests 
a breach of any of these restrictions could result in a default under our debt agreements 
our lenders have taken security interests in substantially all of our consolidated assets  and we have pledged the stock of our subsidiaries to secure the debt under our credit facility 
if an event of default under our credit facility occurs  our credit facility lenders could declare all amounts outstanding  including accrued interest  immediately due and payable 
if we could not repay those amounts  those lenders could proceed against the collateral pledged to them to secure that indebtedness 
if our credit facility indebtedness were accelerated  our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness 
our ability to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements will depend upon our future performance and various other factors  such as business  competitive  technological  legislative and regulatory factors  some of which are beyond our control 
if we fail to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our existing debt agreements  the holders of our debt could declare all amounts owed to them immediately due and payable 
risks related to our class a common stock the public market for our class a common stock may be volatile 
we cannot assure you that the market price of our class a common stock will not decline  and the market price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to such factors as conditions and trends in the radio broadcasting industry  actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  including audience share ratings and financial results  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  technological innovations  competitive developments  adoption of new accounting standards affecting companies in general or affecting companies in the radio broadcasting industry in particular  and general market conditions and other factors 
further  the stock markets  and in particular the nasdaq national market  on which our class a common stock is listed  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology and media companies and have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
in addition  general economic  political and market conditions such as recessions  interest rate movements or international currency fluctuations  may adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
certain stockholders control or have the ability to exert significant influence over the voting power of our capital stock 
as of february   and after giving effect to the exercise of all of their options exercisable within days of that date  lewis w

dickey  j 
dickey and other members of their family  collectively own  shares  or approximately  of our outstanding class a common stock  and  shares  or  of our outstanding class c common stock  which collectively represent approximately of the outstanding voting power of our common stock 
consequently  they have the ability to exert significant influence over our policies and management 
the interests of these stockholders may differ from the interests of our other stockholders 
as of february   ba capital company  lp  referred to as ba capital  and its affiliate  bancamerica capital investors sbic i  lp  referred to as baci  together own  shares  or  of our class a common stock and  shares  or  of our nonvoting class b common stock  
table of contents which is convertible into shares of class a common stock 
ba capital also holds presently exercisable options to purchase  shares of our class a common stock  and baci also holds a warrant to purchase  shares of our class a common stock or class b common stock 
assuming that those options were exercised for shares of class a common stock and the warrant was exercised for shares of class a common stock  and giving effect to the conversion into shares of class a common stock of all shares of class b common stock held by ba capital and baci  ba capital and baci would hold approximately of the total voting power of our common stock

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at december   approximately of the company s long term debt bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  the company s earnings and after tax cash flow are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and assuming a one percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that the company s interest expense and net income would have changed by million 
during fiscal  we did not employ derivative agreements to manage interest rate fluctuations 
however  in march  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixed the interest rate  based on libor  on million of our current floating rate bank borrowings for a three year period 
this agreement is intended to reduce the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations and was not entered into for speculative purposes 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management would likely take actions  in addition to the interest rate swap agreement discussed above  to mitigate its exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  additional analysis is not possible at this time 
further  such analysis would not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
foreign currency risk as a result of the acquisition of caribbean communications company ltd  ccc  the company has operations in five countries throughout the english speaking eastern caribbean 
all foreign operations are measured in their local currencies 
as a result  the company s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company has operations 
the company maintains no derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to translation and or transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude the adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future 
our foreign operations generated net income of less than million for the year ended december  it is estimated that a change in the value of the us dollar to the eastern caribbean dollar or the trinidad and tobago dollar would change net income for the year ended december  by an amount less than million
