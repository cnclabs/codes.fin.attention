table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and other sections of this report contain forward looking statements about our financial condition  results of operations  business and prospects 
these statements appear in several sections of this report and generally include any of the words believe  expect  foresee  anticipate  intend  estimate  hope  may  would  could  should  will  plan or similar expressions

forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance 
they involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions  many of which are unpredictable and not within our control 
our future results and shareholder values may differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements because of a variety of risks and uncertainties  including general economic and business conditions  our expectations and estimates concerning future financial performance  financing plans and the impact of competition  anticipated trends in our business  existing and future regulations affecting our business  and other risk factors described in risk factors below  in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission and in our public announcements 
we do not intend to update these forward looking statements after the date of this report  even if new information  future events or other circumstances have made them incorrect or misleading as of any future date 
for all of these statements  we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements provided in section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of general our business was established in at december   we provided business services to orthodontic and pediatric dental practices 
the following table provides information about these affiliated practices 
these amounts do not include the excluded orthalliance affiliated practices  which are orthodontic and pediatric dental practices that are engaged in litigation with orthalliance and have ceased paying service fees to orthalliance 
number of affiliated practices year ended december  affiliated practices at beginning of period affiliated practices added affiliated practices deaffiliated or transitioned affiliated practices at end of period of the affiliated practices added during  were in connection with our acquisition of orthalliance in november  we expect that future growth in the number of our affiliated practices will come from both developing practices with newly recruited and current 
table of contents orthodontists and pediatric dentists  as well as acquiring the assets of and affiliating with established orthodontic and pediatric dental practices 
generally  when we develop a new center  all patients treated at the center are new patients and  in the first several months after commencing operations  the center is open only for a limited number of days each month as new patients are added 
our affiliated centers have generally become increasingly more productive and profitable as more new patients are added and existing patients return for monthly follow up visits 
after approximately months of operations  a center s growth in patient base has typically begun to stabilize as the initial patients complete treatment 
at that point  a center can increase the number of patients treated by improving the efficiency of its clinical staff  increasing patient treatment intervals and adding operating days or practitioners 
our affiliated practices may also increase revenue by implementing periodic price increases 
established practices with which we have affiliated have typically increased their revenue by applying our operating strategies and systems  including increased advertising and efficient patient scheduling 
critical accounting policies and estimates we provide business services to orthodontic and pediatric dental practices 
our consolidated financial statements include fee revenue earned under our service  consulting and management service agreements and recognized under our revenue recognition policy  along with the expenses of providing those services 
we do not consolidate the patient revenue and other operations and accounts of our affiliated practices 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies are important in portraying our financial condition and results of operations  and require management s difficult  subjective or complex judgments due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
in acquiring the non professional assets of an orthodontic or pediatric dental practice  and entering into a service or consulting agreement with the practice  we allocate part of the related costs to an intangible asset 
the intangible asset is amortized over the term of the service or consulting agreement  up to years 
we evaluate the carrying amount of these intangible assets quarterly based on management s estimates of future service fees over the remaining term of the agreement 
these estimates require management to make certain assumptions regarding future cash flows based on current information regarding the operational aspects of the practice 
future events may change management s estimates 
any impairment charge recorded will be based on the discounted cash flows method 
we provide an allowance for uncollectible amounts based on our estimate of service fees receivable that may not be paid by our affiliated practices 
the allowance for uncollectible amounts of service fees receivable is currently calculated based upon an aging of affiliated practices patient fees receivable for of amounts over days past due  of amounts over days past due and of amounts for which patients have not yet been billed 
these amounts are derived from our experience in collecting patient fees receivables on behalf of affiliated practices 
we also provide an allowance for uncollectible amounts of advances to affiliated practitioners based on management s assessment of our affiliated practices inability to repay their obligations 
if the financial circumstances of our affiliated practices deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
the company used internal and external data in estimating the fair value of orthalliance s assets and liabilities in connection with our acquisition of orthalliance on november  our future operating results may be significantly affected depending on the accuracy of management s estimates should the actual values of the assets and liabilities acquired materially differ from the fair value assigned by management 
at december   our financial statements reflected approximately million of goodwill related to the orthalliance merger 
goodwill is carried at cost and is not amortized  but is tested for 
table of contents impairment by applying a fair value concept in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
the evaluation of the impairment loss requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
management determined that this goodwill was not impaired at december  adverse changes to our operations and other factors could result in impairment losses in the future 
under our revenue recognition policy  we must make certain estimates  including amounts to be retained by our affiliated practices 
we recognize fee revenue based upon a straight line allocation of our affiliated practices patient contract balances over the terms of the patient contracts  less amounts retained or estimated to be retained by the affiliated practices during the term of treatment  plus reimbursement of certain practice related expenses 
we discuss our revenue recognition policy in greater detail in the following subsection 
for further discussion on our accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition fee revenue consists of amounts earned under our service  consulting and management service agreements and recognized under our revenue recognition policy 
effective january   we changed our fee revenue recognition policy pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab summarizes certain of the securities and exchange commission staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
we recognize fee revenue as follows we allocate the total amount of patient fees under each patient contract of an affiliated practice on a straight line basis over the term of the patient contract which generally averages about months 
we then reduce that allocated amount by the portion that is retained or to be retained by affiliated practices amounts retained by affiliated practices  which consists of amounts collected in the relevant period and retained by affiliated practices under the terms of their service  consulting or management service agreements  and amounts not collected in the relevant period that we estimate will be retained by affiliated practices in future periods 
we then offset a portion of amounts retained by affiliated practices by adding amounts related to certain unreimbursed practice related expenses incurred on behalf of affiliated practices and recorded as expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
we recognize these expense amounts as fee revenue to the extent affiliated practices generate sufficient patient fees receivable to secure reimbursement of the expenses  up to amounts retained by affiliated practices 
these adjustments have the effect of impacting the timing of recognition of fee revenue 
some of our affiliated practices require that their patients pay a down payment of approximately of the total treatment fee at the commencement of treatment 
because we recognize fee revenue based on a straight line allocation of patient contract balances  this results in us receiving cash in advance of recognizing fee revenue 
we record these amounts as service fee prepayments and defer recognition of these amounts as fee revenue until they are recognized under our revenue recognition policy 
until amounts related to unreimbursed practice related expenses are recognized as fee revenue under our revenue recognition policy  our rights to receive reimbursement for these expenses are not recorded on our balance sheet as service fees receivable  even though affiliated practices have a contractual obligation to reimburse us 
at december   unreimbursed practice related expenses recorded as expenses in our consolidated statements of income  but not recognized as fee revenue or recorded as service fees receivable  totaled approximately million 

table of contents under most of oca s service agreements  service fees are calculated based upon a specified percentage of patient contract balances allocated over the term of the patient contracts  less amounts retained by affiliated practices 
because we recognize fee revenue based on a straight line allocation of patient contract balances  this may result in us recognizing a portion of our fee revenue after corresponding service fees have become contractually due under our service agreements 
the cumulative effect of our change in accounting principle effective january  pursuant to sab was million  net of income tax  which is reflected in our results of operations for the cumulative effect of the change was also reflected in a reduction in service fees receivable  net of allowance for uncollectible amounts  to million as of december  from million as of december  the pro forma net income amounts for and presented in item selected financial and operating data were calculated assuming that the change in accounting principle pursuant to sab was effective throughout all periods presented 
service fees receivable service fees receivable represents fee revenue owed to us by our affiliated practices 
during  service fees receivable  net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts  increased million or to million at december  from million at december  this increase resulted from varying increases in three categories of fee revenue fee revenue related to patient fees receivable that have been billed to patients or third party payors billed patient fees receivable  fee revenue related to patient fees receivable that have not yet been billed to patients or third party payors unbilled patient fees receivable  and fee revenue related to certain unreimbursed practice related expenses that we have incurred on behalf of affiliated practices and recorded as expenses 
as discussed in the section captioned revenue recognition  we recognize fee revenue based in part on a straight line allocation of affiliated practices patient contract balances over the terms of the patient contracts 
this straight line allocation includes billed patient fees receivable and unbilled patient fees receivable 
a portion of our fee revenue also relates to certain unreimbursed practice related expenses incurred on behalf of affiliated practices and recorded as expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
we generally collect our service fees receivable when patient fees are billed and collected by or on behalf of our affiliated practices 
service fees receivable are comprised of a current and long term component 
the current portion of service fees receivable consists of fee revenue related to billed patient fees receivable and unbilled patient fees receivable 
the long term component is the unreimbursed expense portion of service fee receivables  for which we are to be reimbursed over a five year period 
during  the current portion of service fees receivable increased million or to million  net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts of million  at december  from million  net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts of million  at december  during  the unreimbursed expense portion of service fees receivable increased million or to million at december   from million at december  
table of contents the components of service fees receivable are reflected in the following table and discussed in greater detail below december  increase in millions current portion of service fees receivable fee revenue related to billed patient fees receivable fee revenue related to unbilled patient fees receivable subtotal less allowance for uncollectible amounts current portion of service fees receivable  net unreimbursed expense portion of service fees receivable fee revenue related to certain unreimbursed expenses total service fees receivable  net current portion of service fees receivable fee revenue related to billed patient fees receivable 
at december   approximately million of our service fees receivable resulted from fee revenue related to billed patient fees receivable  representing an increase of million or from million at december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in the aggregate dollar amount of our affiliated practices patient contracts during  which resulted from an increase of in the overall number of patient contracts and an increase of in the average amount of treatment fees charged per patient by our affiliated practices during the increase was also due to an increase in the average number of days between billing and collection of patient fees during fee revenue related to unbilled patient fees receivable 
during  of the three components of service fees receivable  the largest percentage increase was in service fees receivable from fee revenue related to unbilled patient fees receivable 
at december   approximately million of our service fees receivable resulted from fee revenue related to unbilled patient fees receivable  representing an increase of million or from million at december  as discussed in the following paragraphs  this increase was primarily due to the timing differences in when certain patient fees are billed and when related fee revenue is recognized under our revenue recognition policy 
as discussed above in the section captioned revenue recognition  we recognize fee revenue based in part on a straight line allocation of the patient contract balances of our affiliated practices over the terms of the patient contracts which average about months 
however  our affiliated practices generally do not bill their patients on a straight line basis 
rather  most of our affiliated practices use our recommended payment plan for their patients  which results in a disproportionate amount of patient fees being billed and collected at the end of the treatment term 
this generally results in an increasing amount of service fees receivable over a patient s term of treatment 
our recommended payment plan provides for no down payment  an initial record fee  equal monthly installments and a final retainer fee 
the initial record fee is generally billed in the first month of treatment along with one of the monthly installments and is generally equal to the amount of one monthly installment 
the final retainer fee is generally billed and collected in the final month of treatment and is generally equal to four times the monthly installment amount 

table of contents the following chart illustrates how service fees receivable resulting from fee revenue related to unbilled patient fees receivable tend to increase over the term of a patient contract for practices that use our recommended payment plan 
chart under our revenue recognition policy  service fees relating to a patient contract  including the initial record fee and the final retainer fee  are recognized as fee revenue evenly over the course of the patient s treatment  even though the initial record fee and the final retainer fee are generally billed and collected at the beginning and end of treatment  respectively 
payment of the initial record fee generally results in a service fee prepayment  because it is collected before we recognize all of the related fee revenue 
in contrast  the final retainer fee generally results in service fees receivable  because we recognize related fee revenue before it is billed or collected 
these service fees receivable gradually accumulate over the course of treatment until the final retainer fee is billed and collected in the final month 
the effect of this accumulation was amplified during as the average age of our affiliated practices patient contracts increased by approximately months to months at december  from months at december  in addition  there was a increase in the number of patients being treated by our affiliated practices in and a increase in the average total treatment fee  which also contributed to the increase in unbilled patient fees receivable 
unreimbursed expense portion of service fees receivable fee revenue related to unreimbursed practice related expenses 
during  of the three components of service fees receivable  the largest dollar amount and the largest dollar increase was in the unreimbursed expense portion of service fees receivable 
this represents the long term component of service fees receivable 
at december   approximately million of our service fees receivable resulted from fee revenue related to certain unreimbursed practice related expenses  representing an increase of million or from million at december  this increase was primarily due to the timing difference in when the expense amounts were recognized as fee revenue under our revenue recognition policy and when affiliated practices are contractually obligated to reimburse us for these expenses generally over a five year period 
a portion of our fee revenue represents reimbursement of certain practice related expenses incurred on behalf of affiliated practices and recorded as expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
we generally recognize fee revenue relating to these expenses to the extent that affiliated practices generate sufficient patient fees receivable to secure reimbursement of the expenses 
see the section above captioned revenue recognition 
under the terms of most of oca s service agreements  our affiliated practices generally reimburse us for certain practice related expenses over a five year period 
these expenses include operating losses and other expenses for newly developed or de novo centers including those developed by existing practices  and depreciation expense related to property  equipment and improvements 
this generally results in an increasing amount of service fees 
table of contents receivable as the reimbursable practice related expenses are recognized as fee revenue  until the expenses are actually reimbursed over the five year period 
unreimbursed practice related expenses include operating losses 
newly developed or de novo centers typically generate operating losses during their first months of operations 
under the terms of most of oca s service agreements  we generally fund these operating losses and defer reimbursement of the affiliated practice s portion of the operating losses until the de novo center begins to generate operating profits 
we record the related operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income when incurred 
we generally charge the affiliated practice interest on those deferred amounts at market rates 
after the de novo center becomes profitable  the affiliated practice usually begins to reimburse us for the operating losses over a five year period 
mature practices may also occasionally generate operating losses  which are generally repaid in subsequent periods from amounts that otherwise would have been retained by the affiliated practice 
depreciation expense relating to property  equipment and improvements 
we generally purchase and provide the property  equipment and improvements used in our affiliated practices 
we depreciate property  equipment and improvements over their estimated useful lives and record the depreciation expense in our consolidated statements of income 
under the terms of most of oca s service agreements  affiliated practices generally reimburse us for their portion of the costs of these property  equipment and improvements over a five year period 
we charge the affiliated practice interest on these amounts at market rates 
expenses our expenses include the operating expenses of our affiliated centers  which we recognize as incurred 
employee costs consist of wages  salaries and benefits paid to all of our employees  including orthodontic assistants  business staff and management personnel 
marketing and advertising expenses consist of costs associated with advertising for affiliated practices 
general and administrative expenses consist of  among other things  provisions for uncollectible service fees receivable and advances to affiliated practices  professional fees  maintenance and utility costs  office supply expense  telephone expense  taxes  license fees  printing expense and shipping expense 
business combination with orthalliance on november   orthalliance became our wholly owned subsidiary in a stock for stock merger whereby our newly formed subsidiary merged into orthalliance 
orthalliance was formed in october and provides management and consulting services to orthodontists and pediatric dentists located throughout the united states 
the orthalliance merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the results of operations of orthalliance have been included in our consolidated financial statements since november  overview of service and consulting agreements we provide a wide range of services to our affiliated practices  including marketing and advertising  management information systems  staffing  supplies and inventory  scheduling  billing  financial reporting  accounting and other administrative services 
these services are provided under long term agreements with affiliated orthodontists and pediatric dentists and or their professional entity 
the terms of these agreements typically range from to years  with most being years 
the form of agreement used for a particular affiliated practice is based upon the dental regulatory provisions of the state in which the affiliated practice is located 
we use a form of service agreement in most states 
we use a form of consulting agreement in a small number of states with relatively restrictive laws relating to the practice of dentistry 
orthalliance and its affiliated practices are parties to service  consulting or management service agreements that differ in some respects from the service and consulting agreements that oca has historically used 
oca service and consulting agreements under oca s general form of service agreement  we provide affiliated practices with a wide range of business services in exchange for monthly service fees 
the service fees we earn under these service agreements generally 
table of contents represent reimbursement for direct and indirect expenses that we incur in providing services to an affiliated practice including employee costs  marketing and advertising costs  office rent  utilities expense  supply costs and general and administrative expenses  a portion of the operating profits of the affiliated practice on a cash basis and  in some cases  hourly based service fees 
we are also to be reimbursed for the affiliated practice s share of operating losses for newly developed or de novo centers and depreciation expense related to property  equipment and improvements used in the operation of the practice 
excluding reimbursement of direct and indirect expenses and any hourly based service fees  service fees based on the operating profits of the affiliated practice generally range from to of a mature practice s cash operating profits 
in some cases  this is after reduction for any hourly based service fees or hourly based amounts retained by an affiliated practice 
under oca s general form of consulting agreement  the types of services we provide to affiliated practices are generally similar to the services we provide under our general form of service agreement 
fees paid to us under the consulting agreements generally are a combination of  depending on the service being performed  cost based types of fees  flat monthly fees and hourly fees 
orthalliance service  consulting and management service agreements under orthalliance s general form of service agreements  orthalliance generally must provide or arrange for certain services for its affiliated practices  and advise and assist the practices with respect to certain other services 
these services are similar to those provided under oca s service agreements 
orthalliance is generally responsible for paying certain practice expenses  for which it is to be reimbursed by the affiliated practice 
if the practice s collections are insufficient to fund the practice s current practice expenses  then orthalliance is generally obligated to advance funds for those expenses 
under these service agreements  orthalliance generally receives service fees based on a percentage of adjusted practice revenue generally about  subject in some cases to annual adjustments based upon improvements in the affiliated practice s operating margin and a minimum dollar amount of annual service fees during the first five years of the agreement  or a flat monthly fee with annual fixed dollar increases 
under orthalliance s general form of consulting agreements  orthalliance generally must provide certain specified services to its affiliated practices  provide other services at the request of the practices and consult with or advise the affiliated practices with respect to other services 
these services are generally similar to those provided under oca s service agreements 
under these agreements  orthalliance receives a consulting fee based on one of the fee structures described above with respect to orthalliance s service agreements 
under orthalliance s general form of management service agreements  orthalliance generally is to provide for a wide range of services for its affiliated practices  including providing facilities  equipment  support personnel  utilities  supplies  bookkeeping  marketing and billing and collections services 
these management service agreements generally provide for a service fee that varies from month to month depending on the particular practice s practice revenue and operating expenses  with a maximum of up to of the practice s practice revenue on a cash basis plus reimbursement of practice related expenses 
a few of orthalliance s management service agreements provide for a fixed percentage service fee 
fee revenue attributable to service and consulting agreements during  and  approximately of our fee revenue was attributable to service and management service agreements  with the remainder being attributable to consulting agreements 
during  our operating margin operating profit as a percentage of fee revenue for fee revenue attributable to service and management service agreements was comparable to our operating margin for fee revenue attributable to consulting agreements 
seasonality our affiliated practices have experienced their highest volume of new cases in the summer and other periods when schools are not typically in session 
during these periods  children have a greater opportunity to visit an orthodontist or pediatric dentist to commence treatment 
consequently  our affiliated practices have experienced higher revenue during the first and third quarters of the year as a result of increased patient starts 
during the thanksgiving and christmas seasons  our affiliated practices have experienced reduced volume and fourth quarter revenue for our affiliated practices has been generally lower as compared to other periods

fee revenue increased million  or  to million for from million for this increase was attributable to the following an increase of million in fee revenue for centers open throughout both periods  and a net increase of million in fee revenue from all other centers  including orthalliance affiliated centers 
fee revenue during was negatively impacted by certain orthalliance affiliated practices that stopped paying service fees during during  a total of orthalliance affiliated practices that were paying service fees in the fourth quarter of discontinued paying service fees required under their service  consulting or management service agreements  including in the third and fourth quarters of we stopped accruing fee revenue from these practices  which reduced our fee revenue in the third and fourth quarters of we expect some continued fluctuations in fee revenue during as some orthalliance affiliated practices are expected to buy out of their service  consulting or management service agreements and as other orthalliance affiliated practices that are not currently paying services fees begin utilizing our services and again paying service fees 
we also expect that declines in fee revenue from these buy outs will be offset by increases in fee revenue from other practices over time

consistent with industry trends  our affiliated orthodontists have begun increasing the intervals between patient treatments 
during  patients in our affiliated orthodontic centers averaged days between office visits  compared to an average of days during this increase in patient treatment interval reduces the number of office visits during the term of a patient s treatment  which continues to average about months  and results in lower employee costs per patient 
the increased interval does not  however  reduce the amount of treatment fees per patient 
therefore  the increased interval reduces the employee costs incurred with respect to an individual patient relative to the patient s treatment fee 
orthodontic supplies 
orthodontic supplies primarily represent the costs of bands  brackets and wires used during orthodontic treatments and the costs of retainers and other removable or fixed appliances used prior to or after orthodontic treatments 
orthodontic supplies expense increased million  or  to million for from million for as a percentage of fee revenue  orthodontic supplies expense increased to for from for this increase was primarily due to increases  for the first time in about three years  in prices charged for orthodontic supplies by certain of our vendors

the dsl connection allows for certain software applications to be provided through a world wide web interface  which enables affiliated practices to access and update patient records  accounting records and other data from any location 
the increase in office supplies expense was primarily attributable to price increases by certain vendors  some of which increased prices for the first time in about three years  and an increase in office supplies use due to an increased number of patients and affiliated practices during depreciation and amortization

of this amount  million was paid in cash and the remaining million  which is included in noncash items  relates to forgiveness of debt owed by the former employee 
deferred income taxes 
in april  we filed an application with the internal revenue service irs to change our method of recognizing revenue for income tax purposes to a method that is comparable to the method we use for financial reporting purposes 
we did not make any estimated federal income tax payments during based on our expectation that the one time  cumulative effect of the change in tax accounting method would at least alleviate any liability for estimated federal income tax installments during on january   the irs granted our requested change in tax accounting method  which reduced our federal and state income tax liability by approximately million 
we have reduced our long term deferred tax assets for federal and state income tax liability for by million and expect the deferred tax assets will offset a portion of the federal and state income tax payable for in addition  we received refunds of million for a portion of the deferred income taxes recorded from the orthalliance acquisition 
service fees receivable 
during  the current portion of service fees receivable  net of allowance for uncollectible amounts  increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the unreimbursed expense portion of service fees receivable increased million  or  during  to million at december  from million at december  our form of service agreement provides for reimbursement of the affiliated practices share of certain expenses over a five year period 
these amounts represent a non current receivable from the affiliated practices and are classified as such in our financial statements 
because of the long term nature of these receivables  cash flow from operating activities is negatively affected by the increase in service fees receivable 
these increases resulted from varying increases in three categories of fee revenue fee revenue related to patient fees receivable that have been billed to patients or third party payors  fee revenue related to patient fees receivable that have not yet been billed to patients or third party payors  and fee revenue related to certain unreimbursed practice related expenses 
this increase and these three categories of fee revenue are addressed in greater detail in the section above captioned service fees receivable 
service fee prepayments 
during  service fee prepayments decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  service fee prepayments represent service fees which we have not yet recognized for revenue recognition purposes  but for which we have received payment from affiliated practices 
some of our affiliated practices require that their patients pay a down payment of approximately of the total treatment fee at the commencement of treatment 
because we recognize fee revenue based on a straight line allocation of treatment fees  this results in us receiving cash in advance of incurring certain practice related expenses and recognizing certain service fees as fee revenue 
the decrease in service fee prepayments during was primarily due to a decrease in new patient contracts initiated by orthalliance affiliated practices in as compared to supplies inventory 
during  cash used for supplies inventory increased by million to million in from million this increase was primarily due to the number of patients currently being treated and the overall price increase charged by our vendors 
accounts payable and other current liabilities 
during  cash used for accounts payable and other current liabilities increased by million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to decreases of million in deferred revenue and million in income taxes payable

we borrowed an additional million under the revolving line of credit and million under our bridge credit facility in  primarily to repay million of indebtedness outstanding under orthalliance s revolving line of credit upon the merger with orthalliance 
uses of capital capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures consist primarily of the costs associated with expenditures to facilitate growth in new and existing centers  maintenance expenditures to sustain current levels of business activity at existing centers  acquisitions of the fixed assets of newly affiliated practices and development of de novo centers in the united states and abroad 
the average cost of developing a new orthodontic center in the united states is about  including the cost of equipment  leasehold improvements  working capital and start up losses associated with the initial operations of the orthodontic center 
these costs are shared by us and the particular affiliated practice 
we generally bear an affiliated practice s share of these costs until we are reimbursed by the practice 
in some cases  we have assisted our practices in obtaining financing for their share of these costs by providing a guaranty of loans from our primary lender 
the outstanding balance of these amounts we guaranteed was approximately  and million at december  and december   respectively 
during our rapid growth in the s  we expended a disproportionately high amount of our capital investment on de novo centers relative to expenditures on existing centers 
during recent years  however  our capital expenditures have been increasingly directed toward remodeling  improving and expanding our existing affiliated centers to facilitate internal growth 
during recent years  we also invested significantly in computer systems infrastructure and other technology for our affiliated centers  such as advanced digital cameras or dsl data delivery capability 
in addition  we continue to invest in our international operations 

table of contents other uses of capital 
newly developed affiliated practices and existing affiliated practices that expand their capacity by adding additional centers or practitioners typically experience cash flow needs until they begin generating sufficient operating profits at the newly developed or newly expanded centers 
we may advance funds to affiliated practices to assist them in maintaining their compensation during the start up or expansion phase of their practices 
these advances are generally interest free and unsecured 
the affiliated practice generally begins to repay the advances once the practice or center becomes profitable  generally at the beginning of the second year that the practice or center is open 
we intend to fund these advances and any continued financing through a combination of borrowings under our credit facility and cash from operations 
on august   our board of directors approved a common stock repurchase program 
under the program  we may repurchase up to million shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions during the months following approval of the repurchase program 
through december   we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the shares were repurchased in the open market at prevailing market prices using cash from operations 
repurchased shares are held in treasury  and may be available for use in connection with our stock option plans  stock programs and acquisitions  or for other corporate purposes 
on january   we entered into a new credit facility that permits additional repurchases of shares of our common stock under certain conditions 
we anticipate making additional repurchases under this program 
in  we paid million to certain affiliated practitioners for amounts earned under incentive programs 
participants in these programs are eligible to receive annual payments under these programs during  and if all conditions are met under these programs during  we would pay participants an aggregate of million for at december   we had current maturities of million under our credit facility and million due to our affiliated practices 
we expect cash from operations to fund these payments during capital resources 
on january   we obtained a three year  million credit facility with a lending group that consists of bank of america  na  bank one  na  na bank national association  hibernia bank and whitney national bank 
the credit facility is comprised of a million revolving line of credit and a million term loan 
the revolving line of credit provides funding for our general working capital and expansion of the number of affiliated centers  and bears interest at varying rates above the lender s prime rate or eurodollar rate 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility are secured by a security interest in our ownership interests in our operating subsidiaries 
proceeds from the new credit facility were used to repay approximately million of indebtedness outstanding under our prior revolving credit facility and bridge credit facility 
our new credit facility requires that we maintain certain financial and non financial covenants under the terms of the credit agreement  including a maximum leverage ratio  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  minimum consolidated net worth and maximum ratio of funded debt to total patient contract balances 
the credit agreement also imposes restrictions on our acquisitions  investments  dividends  stock repurchases and other aspects of our business 
if we do not comply with these covenants and restrictions  the lenders could demand immediate payment of all amounts borrowed under the credit facility  and terminate our ability to borrow funds under the credit facility 
we believe that our cash needs will primarily relate to development of additional centers and affiliation with additional practices in the united states and other countries  capital expenditures for our existing affiliated centers and computer systems  repayment of indebtedness  payment of income taxes and general corporate purposes 
our cash needs could vary significantly depending upon our growth  results of operations and new affiliations with additional practices  as well as the outcome of pending litigation and other contingencies 
we expect to fund these cash needs through a combination of cash flows from our operations and funds available under our credit facility 
we currently believe that we will be able to meet our anticipated funding requirements for at least the next months 
however  our ability to meet these funding needs could be adversely affected if we were to suffer adverse results from our operations  or lose a material portion of our affiliated practices  if our affiliated practices were to suffer adverse results of operations or a material loss of patients  if we suffer adverse outcomes from pending litigation and other contingencies or if we violate the covenants and restrictions of our credit facility

risk factors the following are some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual financial condition  results of operations  business and prospects to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report or our other filings with the sec 
these risks and uncertainties are also factors that you should consider before investing in our common stock 
if any of the following risks actually occurred  our business  financial condition and operating results could suffer  and the trading price of our common stock could decline 

table of contents our growth strategy may not succeed  which could have an adverse effect on our financial performance 
we may be unable to continue to increase the productivity of our existing practices and the number of our affiliated practices  or maintain the growth that we have experienced in the past 
our ability to grow will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to implement initiatives designed to increase the productivity of our affiliated practices  our ability to identify and affiliate with a sufficient number of orthodontists and pediatric dentists to open new orthodontic and pediatric dental centers or operate within our existing network of affiliated centers  the ability of our affiliated practices to add new patients  our ability to obtain quality locations for orthodontic and pediatric dental centers in suitable markets  our ability to identify and affiliate with a sufficient number of established orthodontic and pediatric dental practices  our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund our expansion strategy  our ability to successfully operate under applicable government regulations  and our ability to affiliate with orthodontic and pediatric dental practices in other countries and successfully operate in those markets 
in general  it has become increasingly more difficult to recruit additional orthodontic and pediatric dental practices to affiliate with us 
the number of practicing orthodontists in the united states has remained fairly constant in recent years  and only a very limited number of orthodontists and pediatric dentists graduate from graduate programs each year 
many orthodontists have expressed an unwillingness to affiliate with any practice management company  or with a management company that emphasizes advertising orthodontic services to the public 
in addition  some orthodontists have had unsatisfactory experiences in affiliating with other practice management companies and are unwilling to affiliate with us 
our growth strategy may not succeed  and we may have to modify it 
we may be unable to identify and recruit suitable orthodontists and pediatric dentists 
a shortage of available orthodontists and pediatric dentists with the skills we require would have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow 
in addition  many of our service agreements include covenants not to compete  in which we agreed that we would not affiliate with other orthodontic practices within a specified area and that we would limit the total number of orthodontic practices with which we affiliate within a particular market area 
this could limit our ability to add orthodontists and orthodontic centers within the markets in which we have existing affiliated practices 
our ability to attract additional orthodontists and pediatric dentists  and our prospects for success and growth  depend on our ability to integrate an increasing number of affiliated practices and employees 
if we fail to manage our growth  our business may suffer 
our financial results could be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate orthalliance 
on november   we completed a merger whereby orthalliance became our wholly owned subsidiary 
this merger resulted in a significant increase in the number of practices  centers and practitioners for which we provide business services 
many of orthalliance s affiliated practices differ in several respects from the practices with which we have historically been affiliated 
many of orthalliance s affiliated practices are relatively larger practices  that do not generally advertise their services to the public and require that their patients pay about of their treatment fee at the beginning of treatment 
many of orthalliance s affiliated practices are not currently using our proprietary computer systems 
in addition  orthalliance s affiliated practices are parties to service  consulting and management service agreements that differ in several respects from the form of agreements that we typically use 
some of orthalliance s affiliated practitioners are pediatric dentists  and we have limited experience in 
table of contents providing business services to pediatric dentists 
as a result  we may encounter difficulties in integrating orthalliance and its affiliated practices or successfully managing the growth we expect to experience from this merger 
we may encounter unforeseen expenses  complications and delays  including difficulties in employing sufficient staff and operational and management oversight  as well as difficulties in building or maintaining relationships with orthalliance s affiliated practices 
we are a party to various pending litigation  which could adversely affect our business 
we are  and may from time to time become  engaged in various lawsuits  including disputes with our affiliated practices 
as of december   orthalliance was engaged in litigation with of its affiliated practices  in which the practices allege that orthalliance breached the terms of their service  consulting and management service agreements and that these agreements are illegal and unenforceable 
a number of other practices have notified orthalliance that it breached their respective service  consulting and management service agreements  and additional lawsuits could be filed against orthalliance 
while we intend to vigorously defend these lawsuits and our other pending litigation  we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any of them  or that we will not suffer adverse outcomes  some of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
regardless of the outcome of these lawsuits  they could be costly and time consuming  and could divert the time and attention of our management 
our affiliated practices are extensively regulated  which may adversely affect our business and limit how we can operate 
governmental authorities regulate the orthodontic and pediatric dental industry and orthodontic and pediatric dental practices extensively 
these laws generally do not distinguish between the practice of general dentistry  orthodontics and pediatric dentistry  and the requirements and prohibitions relative to the practice of dentistry under such laws generally apply equally to the practice of orthodontics and pediatric dentistry 
we do not control the practice of orthodontics and pediatric dentistry by our affiliated practices or their compliance with legal requirements that apply to orthodontists and pediatric dentists and their practices 
many states prohibit us  as a non professional corporation  from practicing orthodontics and pediatric dentistry  which  in some states  includes managing or operating an orthodontic or pediatric dental office  splitting professional fees with orthodontists or pediatric dentists  owning or controlling equipment used in orthodontic or pediatric dental practices  employing orthodontists or pediatric dentists  setting fees charged for orthodontic or pediatric dental services  maintaining an orthodontist s or pediatric dentist s patient records  or controlling the content of an orthodontist s or pediatric dentist s advertising 
many states also prohibit orthodontists and pediatric dentists from paying any portion of fees received for orthodontic or pediatric dental services in exchange for a patient referral 
in addition  many states impose limits on the tasks an orthodontist or pediatric dentist may delegate to other staff members 
these laws and their interpretation vary from state to state  and regulatory authorities enforce them with broad discretion 
if a court or regulatory authority reviewed our business arrangements with an affiliated practice and concluded that our arrangements did not comply with applicable law  we might have to change those arrangements in a way that adversely affects us 
an affiliated practice may successfully challenge the legality of our long term service and consulting agreements  and we may be unable to enforce non competition and other provisions of those agreements 
we are currently engaged in a number of lawsuits in which affiliated practices have alleged that their service  consulting and management service agreements are illegal and unenforceable 
the laws and regulations of states and countries in which we operate or seek to expand may restrict or adversely affect our relationships with orthodontists 
table of contents or pediatric dentists in those states and countries 
the laws and regulations of states and countries in which we currently operate could change or be interpreted in a way that adversely affects our operations and relationships with affiliated practices 
we may have to change our contractual relationships  alter our financial arrangements or restrict our operations in those states and countries 
these laws and regulations could also prevent us from affiliating with  or providing business services to  orthodontic and pediatric dental practices practicing in those states and countries 
our financial success depends on the efforts and success of our affiliated practices  and our business could suffer if they do not succeed or if our service or consulting agreements with them are terminated 
we receive fees for services we provide for orthodontic and pediatric dental practices under service  consulting and management service agreements 
under most of these agreements  our service fees are determined  at least in part  on the financial performance of the particular practice  so our success depends on the success of our affiliated practices 
changes in the healthcare industry  such as the growth of managed care organizations and provider networks  may result in lower compensation for the services of our affiliated practices 
our service agreements and some of our consulting agreements with affiliated practices have terms ranging from to years  with most ranging from to years 
affiliated practices may generally terminate those agreements for cause  which generally includes our material breach of the agreement 
in some cases  an affiliated practice may terminate their agreement without cause after a specified period of time  subject to substitution of another affiliated practitioner and an obligation not to compete within a specified area 
orthalliance s service  consulting and management service agreements generally do not include affiliated practitioners as parties to the agreements  rather  the agreements are generally with a professional corporation that is owned by an affiliated practitioner  and the affiliated practitioner enters into an employment agreement with his or her professional corporation 
these employment agreements generally provide for a shorter term typically five years than the service  consulting or management service agreement with orthalliance  and a covenant not to compete within a designated area for a period of time typically two years after that term 
the terms of many of these employment agreements will be expiring during the next three years 
in addition  an affiliated practice may successfully challenge the legality of our long term service  consulting and management service agreements  and we may be unable to enforce non competition and other provisions of those agreements 
we are currently engaged in a number of lawsuits in which affiliated practices have alleged that their service  consulting and management service agreements and the non competition provisions in those agreements and in the employment agreements are illegal and unenforceable 
if an affiliated practice were to prevail in such a claim  it could adversely affect our agreements with that practice and our other affiliated practices 
the loss of a substantial number of our agreements with affiliated practices or a material loss of revenue by our affiliated practices  for whatever reason  could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
other orthodontists  pediatric dentists and general dentists compete with our affiliated practices  and other companies compete with us 
orthodontics and pediatric dentistry are highly competitive businesses in each market in which our affiliated practices operate 
our affiliated practices face competition from other orthodontists  pediatric dentists and general dentists in the communities they serve 
many of these competing orthodontists  pediatric dentists and general dentists have more established practices 
providing business services to orthodontic and pediatric dental practices is also a competitive business 
we compete with other companies with strategies similar to ours in providing business services to orthodontic and pediatric dental practices 
competitors with greater access to financial resources may enter our markets and compete with us 
we may not be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors 
also  additional competition may make it more difficult for us to affiliate with additional practices on terms that are favorable to us 
any of these factors could cause us to become less profitable 
our financial results would be adversely affected if we write off intangible assets  fixed assets or goodwill 
in connection with our affiliations with existing orthodontic and pediatric dental practices  we recorded identifiable intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  of about million on our balance sheet as of december  we expect to engage in additional transactions that will result in our recognition of additional identifiable intangible assets and amortization expense 
we also recorded fixed assets of approximately million  net of accumulated depreciation  on our balance sheet as of december  we evaluate on a regular basis whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that all or a portion of the carrying amount of these assets may no longer be recoverable  and is therefore impaired 
in addition  in connection with the orthalliance merger  we 
table of contents recorded goodwill of about million as of december  we anticipate that this goodwill will not be deductible for income tax purposes 
under current accounting standards  we must test the impairment of this goodwill on at least an annual basis  and more often if circumstances warrant 
under current accounting rules  any future determination that impairment of these intangible assets  fixed assets or goodwill has occurred would require us to write off the impaired portion of the goodwill or unamortized intangible assets  resulting in a charge to our earnings 
such a write off could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
changes in accounting principles or sec policies may affect our reported operating results and stock price 
as a public company with securities registered under the securities exchange act of  we prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which summarizes the sec staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements  became effective in the fourth quarter of for companies  such as us  with fiscal years ending on december we have modified our revenue recognition policies to conform with the guidance in staff accounting bulletin no 
 which resulted in a cumulative charge to our earnings in to reflect the change in accounting principle effective january  this change may make it more difficult for investors to compare our historical operating results against our future operating results 
in addition  any further changes to generally accepted accounting principles or additional sec statements or guidance on accounting policies may require us to further change our accounting practices and policies 
these uncertainties may cause our stock price to decline or result in additional adjustments to our financial results 
our information systems are critical to our business  and a failure of those systems could have a material adverse effect on us 
our business and success depends  in part  upon our ability to store  retrieve  process and manage a significant amount of information  and to provide our affiliated practices with efficient and effective inventory  accounting and scheduling systems 
if our information systems fail to perform as expected  of if we suffer an interruption  malfunction or loss of information processing capabilities  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  relationships with our affiliated practitioners and ability to affiliate with additional practices 
our international activities expose us to operational challenges that we might not otherwise face 
we operate in japan  spain  puerto rico and mexico  and may expand into additional countries 
as we increase our international activities  we will have to confront and manage a number of risks and expenses that we would not otherwise face if we conducted our operations solely in the united states  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
these risks and expenses include difficulties in staffing and managing foreign offices as a result of  among other things  language and cultural differences  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local companies  political and economic instability in some international markets  multiple  conflicting and changing government laws and regulations  trade barriers  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  and potentially adverse tax consequences 

table of contents we depend on a few key employees  and  if we lose them  our business could suffer 
our success depends upon the continued active participation of our senior management 
the loss of the services of any of these officers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified managerial personnel 
our financial results may be damaged by successful claims against our affiliated practices 
we provide business services to orthodontic and pediatric dental practices that provide orthodontic and pediatric dental treatment to the public and are exposed to the risk of professional liability and other claims 
those claims  if successful  could result in substantial damage awards 
those awards might exceed the limits of any applicable insurance coverage 
insurance against losses of this type can be expensive 
insurance rates vary from state to state 
we do not control the practice of orthodontics or pediatric dentistry by our affiliated practices or their compliance with the legal and other requirements applicable to orthodontists and pediatric dentists and their practices 
a successful malpractice claim against an affiliated practice or us could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our business is subject to the risks of hurricanes  floods and other catastrophic events 
our corporate headquarters  including certain of our computer system and billing operations  are located in the new orleans  louisiana area  which has experienced hurricanes and flooding in the past 
a significant natural disaster  such as a hurricane or a flood  could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  despite our implementation of network security measures  our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins  and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
in addition  the effects of war or acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
antitrust laws could limit our ability to operate or expand 
we are subject to a range of antitrust laws that prohibit anticompetitive conduct  including price fixing  concerted refusals to deal and divisions of markets 
these laws may limit our ability to enter into service or consulting agreements with separate orthodontists or pediatric dentists who compete with one another in the same geographic market 
our anti takeover provisions may discourage a change in our control  even if it would benefit our stockholders 
some of the provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage a change in our control or make it more difficult to achieve  even if a change in control is in our stockholders best interests 
for example  some actions by our board of directors require a supermajority vote rather than a simple majority vote 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to determine the preferences and rights of preferred stock which we may issue without any vote or approval of the holders of our common stock 
the rights of common stockholders will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that we may issue in the future 
through the issuance of preferred stock with certain powers  the board of directors may prevent changes in our management and control 
our board of directors is divided into three classes of directors 
directors from each class serve staggered three year terms  which may limit our stockholders ability to replace a majority of our directors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
all financial instruments that we hold described below we hold for purposes other than trading 

table of contents interest rate risk our lines of credit and amounts due from affiliated practices expose our earnings to changes in short term interest rates since the interest rates on the financial instruments are variable 
for lines of credit  if i the variable rates on our financial instruments were to increase by from the rate at december   and ii we borrowed the maximum amount available under our credit facility million for all of  solely as a result of the increase in interest rates  our interest expense would increase  resulting in a  decrease in net income  assuming an effective tax rate of approximately 
this analysis does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment  or the effect of such a change in interest rates as of another or future date 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  we would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change 
foreign currency exchange risk we typically do not hedge our foreign currency exposure 
our foreign operations generated an immaterial loss during funds generated from our foreign operations in were retained in those countries to fund operations 
we believe that our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not currently material to our financial condition or results in operations
