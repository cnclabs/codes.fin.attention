item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations statements in the following discussion may be forward looking and involve risk and uncertainty 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes hereto 
from to we acquired d seismic data in plays  seven basins and seven states 
in and we invested million on d seismic data and acreage in selected plays where we were experiencing attractive d delineated drilling economics and repeatability 
in  we modified our business strategy to recognize the inherent value of our d delineated prospect inventory and to provide significant improvement in our financial and operating results 
this business strategy includes the following elements focus the majority of capital resources in our five focus plays to generate growth in proved reserves  production volumes and cash flow 
continue to grow our inventory of high potential exploration prospects through our technical staff s internal generation of such prospects 
enhance our project returns by attempting to retain operational control over all phases of our exploration and development activities 
allocate a higher percentage of drilling capital toward the development of our prior discoveries 
accelerate the development of our exploration and development prospect inventory by increasing our drilling expenditures 
enhance our return on capital and our cash margins by growing production  resulting in reduced per unit discretionary cash costs 
as a result of this strategy  we have accomplished the following for the three year period ended december  an increase in our net proved reserves from bcfe to bcfe  a compound annual growth rate of 
an increase in our average daily production volumes from mmcfed to mmcfed  a compound annual growth rate of 
an increase in our ebitda  from million to million  representing a compound annual growth rate of 
an increase in our revenues from million to million  a compound annual growth rate of

recent developments in december  we entered into a series of transactions whereby a number of warrants and convertible debt rights were extinguished or converted 
we issued  unregistered shares of our common stock to shell capital in exchange for shell capital s warrant position and to terminate shell capital s right to convert million of our senior credit facility into shares of our common stock 
also  dlj merchant banking partners iii  lp in conjunction with globalenergy partners  both affiliates of csfb private equity  purchased million of our senior credit facility from shall capital and converted it into  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we recorded  in debt conversion expenses associated with this conversion 
in december  we issued csfb private equity  shares of our series b preferred stock with a stated value of per share 
net proceeds from the offering were million and were used to reduce borrowings under our senior credit facility and to fund our drilling program and working capital requirements 
the series b preferred stock has terms similar to our series a preferred stock 
we are required to pay dividends on our series b preferred stock 
at our option  these dividends may be paid in cash at a rate of per annum or paid in kind through the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock in lieu of cash at a rate of per annum 
our option to pay dividends in kind on our series b preferred stock expires in december in connection with the series b preferred stock offering  we issued to csfb private equity warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
to exercise the warrants  csfb has the option to use either cash or shares of our series b preferred stock with an aggregate value equal to the exercise price 
in the event that our stock price averages at least for consecutive trading days  then the warrants must be exercised if we so require 
in december  we extended the maturity on our senior credit facility by one year to december and extended our option to pay interest in kind on our senior subordinated notes facility by one year to october in march  we replaced our senior credit facility with a new senior credit facility 
the new senior credit facility provides for a maximum commitment of million in the form of a revolving bank credit facility  has an initial borrowing base of million and matures in march as of the closing date of the facility  we had million in outstanding borrowings under the new senior credit facility

critical accounting policies the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules  and the use of judgment to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
compliance with the rules necessarily involves reducing a number of very subjective judgments to a quantifiable accounting entry or valuation 
we make every effort to properly comply with all applicable rules on or before their adoption  and we believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules is critical 
our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
property and equipment the method of accounting for oil and gas properties is a critical accounting policy because it determines what costs are capitalized  and how these costs are ultimately matched with revenues and expensed 
we use the full cost method of accounting for oil and properties 
under this method substantially all costs associated with oil and gas exploration and development activities are capitalized  including costs for individual exploration projects that do not directly result in the discovery of hydrocarbon reserves that can be economically recovered 
payroll  interest  and other internal costs we incur for the purpose of finding hydrocarbon reserves are also capitalized 
full cost pool amounts associated with properties that have been evaluated through drilling or seismic analysis are depleted using the units of production method 
the depletion expense per unit of production is the ratio of historical and estimated future development costs to hydrocarbon reserve volumes 
estimation of hydrocarbon reserves relies on professional judgment and use of factors that cannot be precisely determined 
reserve estimates materially different from those reported would change the depletion expense recognized during the reporting period 
for the year ended december   our depletion expense per unit of production was per mcfe 
a change of  mcfe in our estimated net proved reserves at december   would result in a per mcfe change in our per unit depletion expense and a  change in net income available to common shareholders 
to the extent costs capitalized in the full cost pool net of depreciation  depletion and amortization and related deferred taxes exceed the present value using a discount rate and based on period end oil and natural gas prices of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves plus the capitalized cost of unproved properties  such costs are charged to operations as a reduction of the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties  or a capitalized ceiling impairment charge 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil and gas prices are depressed  even if the low prices are temporary 
in addition  capitalized ceiling impairment charges may occur if we experience poor drilling results or estimations of proved reserves are substantially reduced 
a capitalized ceiling impairment is a reduction in earnings that does not impact cash flows  but does impact operating income and stockholders equity 
once recognized  a capitalized ceiling impairment charge to oil and natural gas properties cannot be reversed at a later date 
no assurance can be given that we will not experience a capitalized ceiling impairment charge in future periods 
in addition  capitalized ceiling impairment charges may occur if estimates of proved hydrocarbon reserves are substantially reduced or estimates of future development costs increase significantly 
see risk factors exploratory drilling is a speculative activity involving numerous risks and uncertain costs  we are dependent on exloratory drilling activities  risk factors maintaining reserves and revenues in the future depends on successful exploration and development and risk factors we are subject to uncertainties in reserve estimates and futures net cash flows 
income taxes deferred tax assets are recognized for temporary differences in financial statement and tax basis amounts that will result in deductible amounts and carry forwards in future years 
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences that will result in taxable amounts in future years 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax law and tax rate s for the year in which we expect the temporary differences to be deducted or settled 
the effect of a change in tax law or rates on the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of enactment 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
estimating the amount of the valuation allowance is dependent on estimates of future taxable income  alternative minimum tax income  and changes in shareholder ownership which would trigger limits on use of net operating losses under internal revenue code section revenue recognition because revenue is a key component of our results of operations  and we derive revenue primarily from the sale of produced oil and gas  our revenue recognition for these sales is significant 
we recognize crude oil revenue using the sales method of accounting 
under this method  we recognize revenue when oil is delivered and title transfers 
we recognize natural gas revenue using the entitlements method of accounting 
under this method  revenue is recognized based on our entitled ownership percentage of sales of natural gas to purchasers 
gas imbalances occur when we sell more or less than our entitled ownership percentage of total natural gas production 
when we receive less than our entitled share  a receivable is recorded 
when we receive more than our entitled share  a liability is recorded 
settlements for hydrocarbon sales can occur up to two months after the end of the month in which the oil  gas or other hydrocarbon products were produced 
we estimate and accrue for the value of these sales using information available at the time financial statements are generated 
differences are reflected in the accounting period that payments are received from the purchaser 
for the month of december a change in the price per mcf of gas sold would change revenue by  a change in the price per barrel of oil would change revenue by  derivative instruments and hedging activities we use derivative instruments to manage market risks resulting from fluctuations in commodity prices of natural gas and crude oil 
we periodically enter into commodity contracts  including price swaps  caps and floors  which require payments to or receipts from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed price and a variable price for a fixed quantity of natural gas or crude oil without the exchange of underlying volumes 
the notional amounts of these financial instruments are based on expected production from existing wells 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
on january  in accordance with financial accounting standards board requirements 
sfas no 
 as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction  and depending on the type of hedge transaction 
our derivative contracts consist primarily of cash flow hedge transactions in which we are hedging the variability of cash flow related to a forecasted transaction 
change in the fair value of these derivative instruments are reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified as earnings in the period s in which earnings are impacted by the variability of the cash flow of the hedged item 
we assess the effectiveness of hedging transactions every three months  consistent with documented risk management strategy for the particular hedging relationship 
changes in fair value of ineffective hedges are included in earnings 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and some narrative disclosures 
hydrocarbon reserve  future development costs  and certain hydrocarbon production expense and revenue estimates are the most critical to our financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial standards no 
 asset retirement obligations which establishes accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets including the timing of the liability recognition  initial measurement of the liability  allocation of asset retirement cost to expense  subsequent measurement of the liability and financial statement disclosures 
sfas requires that an asset retirement cost be capitalized as part of the cost of the related long lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic  rational method 
we adopted this standard as required on january  we are currently evaluating the effect of this statement on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections 
sfas requires  except in the case of events or transactions of a highly unusual and infrequent nature  gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt to be classified as components of a company s income or loss from continuing operations 
prior to the adoption of the provisions of sfas  gains or losses on the early extinguishment of debt were required to be classified in a company s periodic consolidated statements of operations as extraordinary gains or losses  net of associated income taxes  after the determination of income or loss from continuing operations 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  due to the requirements of sfas no 
 it is less likely that a gain or loss on extinguishment of debt would be classified as an extraordinary item in our results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
commodity pricing changes in commodity prices significantly affect our capital resources  liquidity and expected operating results 
price changes directly affect revenues and can indirectly impact expected production by changing the amount of funds available to reinvest in exploration and development activities 
the prices we receive for our crude oil production are based on global market conditions 
the price we receive for our natural gas production is primarily driven by north american market forces 
oil and gas prices have fluctuated significantly in recent years in response to numerous economic  political and environmental factors 
the year began with a weakened commodity environment and lower prices 
however  prices were on an upward trend through the year 
prices are also affected by weather  factors of supply and demand  and commodity inventory levels 
during  the high and low settlement prices for oil on the nymex were per bbl and per bbl  and the high and low settlement prices for natural gas on the nymex were per mmbtu and per mmbtu 
we expect that commodity prices will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future

on a per unit of equivalent production basis  lease operating expenses for were per mcfe  compared to per mcfe in the change in our lease operating expense was primarily the result of higher ad valorem taxes due to an increase in property valuations because of higher average commodity prices during and higher overall service cost 
for compared to  total lease operating expenses increased 
the change in lease operating expenses is primarily due to an increase in the number of producing wells 
lease operating expenses on a per unit of production in were per mcfe compared to per mcfe in the increase in our per unit lease operating expense was primarily due to higher overall service cost and higher ad valorem taxes due to an increase in property valuations because of higher average commodity prices during production taxes 
production taxes for were million compared to million in and million in for compared to  the increase in production taxes was primarily due to a reduction in the number of wells that qualify for severance tax refunds in our effective production tax rate in was of pre hedge oil and natural gas sales revenue  compared to in for compared to  the decrease in production taxes was primarily related to production tax refunds on wells that qualify for reduced severance tax rates 
our effective production tax rate in was of pre hedge oil and natural gas sales revenue  compared to in general and administrative expenses

other items contributing to the increase in general and administrative expenses include the cost associated with bringing our oil and natural gas marketing activities in house  increased payroll and benefit expense  higher office rent expense  higher other office expenses and an increase in corporate insurance expense 
for compared to  general and administrative expenses increased 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in employee payroll and benefit expense  office expense  public company expense and contract and professional expense 
depletion of oil and natural gas properties 
depletion of oil and natural gas properties in was million compared to million in and million in for compared to  a increase in our depletion rate accounted for  of the change and higher production volumes accounted for  of the change 
this increase in our per unit depletion expense was due to additional future development cost related to our floyd fault block field discovery 
for compared to  depletion expense increased million 
increased production volumes accounted for million of this increase and a increase in our depletion rate accounted for a million of the increase 
the increase in the depletion rate per unit is primarily due to an increase in the estimated cost required to fully develop our home run field

calculated as the sum of interest expense on outstanding indebtedness and commitment fees divided by weighted average debt outstanding for the period 
for compared to  the change in net interest expense was primarily due to a lower average interest rate on outstanding indebtedness during and to a lesser extent on a decrease in the amount of deferred loan fees amortized 
the change in the average interest rate on our outstanding borrowings was due to a decrease in the london interbank offered rate libor  which is used to determine the interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facility 
the average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facility during was compared to in at december   the interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facility was 
for compared to  the change in net interest expense was primarily due to a lower weighted average outstanding debt balance and a lower average interest rate on our outstanding borrowings during the repurchase of million in subordinated notes in november that bore annual interest rates of to was the primary reason the for the decrease in our weighted average debt balance and lower average interest rate in a decrease in the average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facility due to a lower london interbank offered rate libor during also contributed to the decrease in our average interest rate

our total outstanding indebtedness at december  was million  compared to million at december  there were no similar expenses in prior periods 
extraordinary gain on refinancing of senior subordinated notes 
in november  we repurchased all of our debt and equity securities held by affiliates of enron north america at a substantial discount 
with a portion of the proceeds from two new financing transactions  we repurchased all of the enron affiliates interests  which included i million of senior subordinated notes due which bore interest at annual rates of to and associated accrued interest obligations  ii warrants to purchase an aggregate of one million shares of our common stock at per share  and iii  shares of common stock  for total cash consideration of million 
as a result of the repurchase of the senior subordinated notes due at a discount to the principal amount outstanding  we recorded an extraordinary gain of million in the fourth quarter of there were no similar items during or liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of capital have been funds generated by operations  our senior credit and subordinated notes facility  public and private equity financings and the sale of interests in projects and properties 
our level of earnings and cash flows depends on market prices that we receive for our oil and natural gas production  our ability to find and produce hydrocarbons and our ability to control and reduce cost 
our primary sources of cash during were funds generated from operations  proceeds from the sale of our series b preferred stock and borrowings under our subordinated notes facility 
funds were used primarily for costs associated with drilling  land acquisition and d seismic acquisition  processing and interpretation and to reduce the level of borrowings under our senior credit facility 
cash flows provided used by operating activities in thousands operating cash flow before changes in working capital   changes in working capital   net cash flow provided used by operating activities   for compared to  cash flows provided by operating activities increased by million 
this change included a million increase in cash flow provided by operating activities before changes in working capital and an million increase in cash flow from changes in working capital activities 
the change in cash flow provided by operating activities exclusive of changes in working capital was due to an increase in revenue from the sale of oil and natural gas  a decrease in cash interest expense and a decrease in cash settlements on derivatives that do not qualify for hedging activities 
these changes were partially offset by increases in our lease operating expense  production taxes  cash general and administrative expense and debt conversion cost 
for compared to  cash flows provided by operating activities increased by million 
this change included a million exclusive of changes in working capital increase 
this increase is due to an increase in revenue from the sale of oil and natural gas which was partially offset by an increase in lease operating expense  cash general and administrative expenses  cash interest expense and increase in cash losses on the settlement of derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
cash flows used by investing activities in thousands net cash flow used by investing activities    our primary capital requirements are for cost associated with drilling  land acquisition and d seismic acquisition  processing and interpretation 
our initial capital budget at the start of was projected to be million and was down when compared to capital expenditures in due to lower forecasted oil and natural gas prices at the time  the reduced capital expenditure program reflected our desire to fund our capital expenditure program with cash flow generated from operations  cash on hand at the start of the year and availability under our senior subordinated notes facility 
as the year progressed  we increased our capital budget to partially account for the increase in commodity prices 
for compared to  cash flows used by investing activities decreased 
this change is primarily due to a reduction in capital spending on oil and gas properties 
for compared to  cash flows used by investing activities increased 
this change is primarily due to an increase in capital spending on oil and gas activities 
cash flows provided by financing activities in thousands net cash flow provided by financing activities   over the past three years  we have reduced our reliance on external sources to fund our capital expenditure programs 
for  net cash flow provided by financing activities decreased by million compared to and by million when compared to the decrease in our reliance on external sources to fund our capital expenditures has primarily been the result of an increase in the cash flow generated by our operating activities and reduced capital spending

capital expenditures for are expected to be up approximately over this increase is primarily attributable to a more robust current and forecasted commodity price environment and to lesser degree our additional financial flexibility resulting from the csfb private equity financings completed in december actual capital spending may vary and is subject to changing market condition 
the capital expenditure budget was developed using certain assumed price levels for the sales of crude oil and natural gas and forecasted production growth 
changes in commodity prices or variances from forecasted production growth could impact our cash flows from operations and funds available for reinvestment 
for example  shortfalls in budgeted cash flows from operations could result in the reduction of the our capital spending program  increases in borrowing under our new senior credit facility  issuance of additional equity or debt securities or divestments of properties 
we evaluate our level of capital spending throughout the year based upon drilling results  commodity prices and cash flows from operations

it is not anticipated that we will be required to post cash collateral with the new senior credit facility 
however  future requirements are uncertain and will depend on arrangements with our counterparities and highly volatile oil and natural gas prices 
other matters reconciliation of non gaap measures ebitda is defined as net income loss plus interest expense  depletion  depreciation and amortization expenses  deferred income taxes and other non cash items 
we believe that operating income is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to ebitda as defined 
the following table reconciles ebitda as defined with our operating income  as derived from our financial statements

we believe the use of derivative instruments  although not free of risk  allows us to reduce our exposure to oil and natural gas sales price fluctuations and thereby achieve a more predictable cash flow 
while the use of derivative instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  their use may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
moreover  our hedging arrangements generally do not apply to all of our production and thus provide only partial price protection against declines in commodity prices 
we expect that the amount of our hedges will vary from time to time

effects of inflation and changes in prices our results of operations and cash flows are affected by changing oil and natural gas prices 
if the price of oil and natural gas increases decreases  there could be a corresponding increase decrease in revenues as well as the operating costs that we are required to bear for operations 
inflation has had a minimal effect on us 
environmental and other regulatory matters our business is subject to certain federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration for and the development  production and marketing of oil and natural gas  as well as environmental and safety matters 
many of these laws and regulations have become more stringent in recent years  often imposing greater liability on a larger number of potentially responsible parties 
although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  the requirements imposed by laws and regulations are frequently changed and subject to interpretation  and we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations 
any suspensions  terminations or inability to meet applicable bonding requirements could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operations 
although significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to us  compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our earnings or competitive position 
future regulations may add to the cost of  or significantly limit  drilling activity

forward looking information we or our representatives may make forward looking statements  oral or written  including statements in this report  press releases and filings with the sec  regarding estimated future net revenues from oil and natural gas reserves and the present value thereof  planned capital expenditures including the amount and nature thereof  increases in oil and gas production  the number of wells we anticipate drilling during and our financial position  business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are reasonable  there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by us will be realized or  even if substantially realized  that they will have the expected effects on our business or operations 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are general economic conditions  inherent uncertainties in interpreting engineering data  operating hazards  delays or cancellations of drilling operations for a variety of reasons  competition  fluctuations in oil and gas prices  availability of sufficient capital resources to us or our project participants  government regulations and other factors set forth among the risk factors noted below or in the description of our business in item of this report 
all subsequent oral and written forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these factors 
we assume no obligation to update any of these statements 
risk factors we are substantially leveraged our outstanding long term debt was million as of december   and million as of march  the credit agreements related to our new senior credit facility and senior subordinated notes facility limit the amount of additional debt borrowings  including borrowings under these facilities or other senior or subordinated indebtedness 
as of march   we had million of additional borrowing capacity under our new senior credit facility and no additional borrowing availability under our senior subordinated notes facility 
our level of indebtedness will have several important effects on our operations  including those listed below 
we will dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest on our indebtedness and to the payment of our other current obligations  and will not have these cash flows available for other purposes 
the covenants in our credit facilities limit our ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets and may affect our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in business conditions 
our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired 
we may also be required to alter our capitalization significantly to accommodate future exploration  development or acquisition activities 
these changes in capitalization may significantly alter our leverage and dilute the equity interests of existing stockholders 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations and to reduce our total indebtedness will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to general economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our future performance will not be harmed by such economic conditions and financial  business and other factors 
see liquidity and capital resources 
we have substantial capital requirements we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our exploration and development projects 
while we believe that our cash flow from operations  remaining availability under our new senior credit facility and beginning cash balance should allow us to finance our planned operations through based on current conditions and expectations  additional financing could be required in the future to fund our exploration and development activities 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure additional financing on reasonable terms or at all  or that financing will continue to be available to us under our existing or new financing arrangements 
without additional capital resources  our drilling and other activities may be limited and our business  financial condition and results of operations may suffer 
see liquidity and capital resources 
volatility of oil and gas markets affects us  oil and natural gas prices are volatile our revenues  operating results and future rate of growth depend highly upon the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production 
historically  the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
market prices of oil and natural gas depend on many factors beyond our control  including worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and natural gas  the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls  political instability or armed conflict in oil producing regions  the price and level of foreign imports  the level of consumer demand  the price and availability of alternative fuels  the availability of pipeline capacity  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  and the overall economic environment 
we cannot predict future oil and natural gas price movements with certainty 
during  the high and low settlement prices for oil on the nymex were per bbl and per bbl  and the high and low settlement prices for natural gas on the nymex were per mmbtu and per mmbtu 
significant declines in oil and natural gas prices for an extended period may have the following effects on our business limit our financial condition  liquidity  ability to finance planned capital expenditures and results of operations  reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically  cause us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects  reduce our revenues  operating income and cash flow  and reduce the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties 
our hedging transactions may not prevent losses in an attempt to reduce our sensitivity to energy price volatility  we use swap and collar hedging arrangements that generally result in a fixed price or a range of minimum and maximum price limits over a specified monthly time period 
if we do not produce our oil and natural gas reserves at rates equivalent to our hedged position  we would be required to satisfy our obligations under hedging contracts on potentially unfavorable terms without the ability to hedge that risk through sales of comparable quantities of our own production 
this situation occurred during portions of  due in part to our sale of certain producing reserves in mid as a result  our cash flow was significantly reduced in because the terms of our hedging contracts are based on assumptions and estimates of numerous factors such as cost of production and pipeline and other transportation and marketing costs to delivery points  substantial differences between the hedged prices and actual results could harm our anticipated profit margins and our ability to manage the risk associated with fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices 
hedging contracts limit the benefits we will realize if actual prices rise above the contract prices 
we could be financially harmed if the other party to the hedging contracts proves unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under such contracts

exploratory drilling is a speculative activity involving numerous risks and uncertain costs  we are dependent on exploratory drilling activities our revenues  operating results and future rate of growth depend highly upon the success of our exploratory drilling program 
exploratory drilling involves numerous risks  including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs 
we cannot always predict the cost of drilling  and we may be forced to limit  delay or cancel drilling operations as a result of a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  compliance with governmental requirements  and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment 
we may not be successful in our future drilling activities because even with the use of d seismic and other advanced technologies  exploratory drilling is a speculative activity 
we could incur losses because our use of d seismic data and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies 
even when fully utilized and properly interpreted  our d seismic data and other advanced technologies only assist us in identifying subsurface structures and do not indicate whether hydrocarbons are in fact present in those structures 
because we interpret the areas desirable for drilling from d seismic data gathered over large areas  we may not acquire option and lease rights until after the seismic data is available and  in some cases  until the drilling locations are also identified 
although we have identified numerous potential drilling locations  we cannot assure you that we will ever lease  drill or produce oil or natural gas oil from these or any other potential drilling locations 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our drilling activities  that our overall drilling success rate for activity within a particular province will not decline  or that our completed wells will ultimately produce our estimated economically recoverable reserves 
unsuccessful drilling activities could materially harm our operations and financial condition 
we are subject to various casualty risks our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in drilling for and producing and transporting oil and natural gas  such as fires  natural disasters  formations with abnormal pressures  blowouts  cratering and explosions  and pipeline ruptures and spills 
any of these hazards and risks can result in the loss of hydrocarbons  environmental pollution  personal injury claims and other damage to our properties and the property of others 
see item business operating hazards and uninsured risks 
we may not have enough insurance to cover some operating risks we maintain insurance coverage against some  but not all  potential losses in order to protect against operating hazards 
we may elect to self insure if our management believes that the cost of insurance  although available  is excessive relative to the risks presented 
we generally maintain insurance for the hazards and risks inherent in drilling for and producing and transporting oil and natural gas and believe this insurance is adequate 
if an event occurs that is not covered  or not fully covered  by insurance  it could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we cannot fully insure against pollution and environmental risks 
see item business operating hazards and uninsured risks 
the marketability of our production is dependent on facilities that we typically do not own or control the marketability of our production depends in part upon the availability  proximity and capacity of natural gas gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities 
we generally deliver natural gas through gas gathering systems and gas pipelines that we do not own 
our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas could be harmed by any dramatic change in market factors or by federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation  tax and energy policies  changes in supply and demand  and general economic conditions 
we have historical operating losses and our future results may vary we cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the future 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and total stockholders equity of million 
we have recognized the following annual net losses before extraordinary items since million in   in  million including a net million non cash deferred income tax charge incurred in connection with our conversion from a partnership to a corporation in  million including a million non cash writedown in the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties in  million including a million non cash loss on the sale of oil and natural gas properties in  and million in see item selected financial data 
our future operating results may fluctuate our future operating results may fluctuate significantly depending upon a number of factors  including industry conditions  prices of oil and natural gas  rates of drilling success  capital availability  rates of production from completed wells  and the timing and amount of capital expenditures 
this variability could cause our business  financial condition and results of operations to suffer 
in addition  any failure or delay in the realization of expected cash flows from operating activities could limit our ability to invest and participate in economically attractive projects 
maintaining reserves and revenues in the future depends on successful exploration and development in general  production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted  with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics 
except to the extent we conduct successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves  or both  our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced 
our future oil and natural gas production depends highly upon our ability to economically find  develop or acquire reserves in commercial quantities 
the business of exploring for or developing reserves is capital intensive 
reductions in our cash flow from operations and limitations on or unavailability of external sources of capital may impair our ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our asset base of oil and natural gas reserves 
in addition  we cannot be certain that our future exploration and development activities will result in additional proved reserves or that we will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs 
furthermore  although significant increases in prevailing prices for oil and natural gas could cause increases in our revenues  our finding and development costs could also increase 
finally  we participate in a percentage of our wells as a non operator 
the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations  or an operator s breach of the applicable agreements  could harm us 
we are subject to uncertainties in reserve estimates and future net cash flows there is substantial uncertainty in estimating quantities of proved reserves and projecting future production rates and the timing of development expenditures 
no one can measure underground accumulations of oil and natural gas in an exact way 
accordingly  oil and natural gas reserve engineering requires subjective estimations of those accumulations 
estimates of other engineers might differ widely from those of our independent petroleum engineers 
accuracy of reserve estimates depends on the quality of available data and on engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
our independent petroleum engineers may make material changes to reserve estimates based on the results of actual drilling  testing  and production 
as a result  our reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas we ultimately recover 
also  we make certain assumptions regarding future oil and natural gas prices  production levels  and operating and development costs that may prove incorrect 
any significant variance from these assumptions could greatly affect our estimates of reserves  the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties  the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows 
see item properties oil and natural gas reserves 
actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties also will be affected by factors such as the amount and timing of actual production  supply and demand for oil and natural gas  limits or increases in consumption by gas purchasers  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
the timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves  and thus their actual present value 
in addition  the discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows in compliance with the sec reporting requirements may not necessarily be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general 
we face significant competition we operate in the highly competitive areas of oil and natural gas exploration  exploitation  acquisition and production with other companies 
we face intense competition from a large number of independent  technology driven companies as well as both major and other independent oil and natural gas companies in a number of areas such as seeking to acquire desirable producing properties or new leases for future exploration  marketing our oil and natural gas production  and seeking to acquire the equipment and expertise necessary to operate and develop those properties 
many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially in excess of those available to us 
this highly competitive environment could harm our business 
see item business competition 
we are subject to various governmental regulations and environmental risks our business is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration for  and the development  production and marketing of  oil and natural gas  as well as safety matters 
although we believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation  and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations 
we may be required to make significant expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations 
our operations are subject to complex environmental laws and regulations adopted by federal  state and local governmental authorities 
environmental laws and regulations change frequently  and the implementation of new  or the modification of existing  laws or regulations could harm us 
the discharge of natural gas  oil  or other pollutants into the air  soil or water may give rise to significant liabilities on our part to the government and third parties and may require us to incur substantial costs of remediation 
we cannot be certain that existing environmental laws or regulations  as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future  or future laws or regulations will not harm our results of operations and financial condition

accordingly  these stockholders  as a group  will be able to control the outcome of stockholder votes  including votes concerning the election of directors  the adoption or amendment of provisions in our certificate of incorporation or bylaws  and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions 
the existence of these levels of ownership concentrated in a few persons makes it unlikely that any other holder of common stock will be able to affect our management or direction

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management opinion concerning derivative instruments we limit our use of derivative instruments principally to commodity price hedging activities  whereby gains and losses are generally offset by price changes in the underlying commodity 
our use of derivative instruments for hedging activities could materially affect its results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods since such instruments can limit our ability to benefit from favorable oil and natural gas price movements 
commodity price risk our primary commodity market risk exposure is to changes in the prices related to the sale of its oil and natural gas production 
the market prices for oil and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
as such  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the sales prices we receives for its oil and natural gas production using derivative instruments 
we believe the use of derivative instruments  although not free of risk  allows us to reduce our exposure to oil and natural gas sales price fluctuations and thereby achieve a more predictable cash flow 
while the use of derivative instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  their use may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
moreover  our hedging arrangements generally do not apply to all of its production and thus provide only partial price protection against declines in commodity prices 
we expect that the amount of our hedges will vary from time to time 
the gas derivative transactions are generally settled based upon the average of the reporting settlement prices on the nymex for the last three trading days of a particular contract month
