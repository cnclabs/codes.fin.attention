item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in addition to the historical information contained in this document  the discussion in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of the company s plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form k should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements whenever they appear in this annual report on form k 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those cautionary statements and other factors set forth in risk factors and elsewhere herein 
revenue declined sequentially in every quarter in fiscal and has remained relatively weak throughout fiscal in the test and assembly sector of the semiconductor equipment industry during what we believe is a severe cyclical downturn in the industry 
there is uncertainty as to if and when the next cyclical growth phase will occur 
until such time as we return to a growth period  we expect a continuing weak environment for orders and therefore expect that the january  fiscal quarter s revenue could be materially lower from those recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter of and may continue to remain weak throughout fiscal our sales  gross margins and operating results have in the past fluctuated significantly and will  in the future  fluctuate significantly depending upon a variety of factors 
the factors that have caused and will continue to cause our results to significantly fluctuate include cyclicality or downturns in the semiconductor market and the markets served by our customers  the timing of new product announcements and releases by us or our competitors  market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of our products  manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the start up of new products  changes in pricing by us  our competitors  customers or suppliers  the ability to volume produce systems and meet customer requirements  inventory obsolescence  patterns of capital spending by customers  delays  cancellations or rescheduling of orders due to customer financial difficulties or otherwise  expenses associated with acquisitions and alliances  product discounts  product reliability  the proportion of direct sales and sales through third parties  including distributors and original equipment manufacturers  the mix of products sold  the length of manufacturing and sales cycles  natural disasters  political and economic instability  regulatory changes and outbreaks of hostilities 
due to these and additional factors  historical results and percentage relationships discussed in this annual report on form k will not necessarily be indicative of the results of operations for any future period 
for a further discussion of our business  and risk factors affecting our results of operations  please refer to the section entitled risk factors included elsewhere herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  net sales and expenses  and the related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience  our knowledge of economic and market factors and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we historically recognized revenue on the sale of semiconductor manufacturing equipment upon shipment 
we changed our revenue recognition policy based on guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab we adopted sab effective november  ie  fiscal 
in accordance with guidance provided in sab  we recorded a non cash charge of million after reduction for income taxes of million  or per diluted share  to reflect the cumulative effect of the accounting change as of the beginning of fiscal as a result of the adoption of sab  the increase to net income for fiscal year was million or per basic share and per diluted share 
this amount is comprised of equipment that was shipped to certain customers and previously recorded as revenue  but had not been accepted as of october  under sab  we recognize revenue on the sale of semiconductor manufacturing equipment when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and customer acceptance criteria have been successfully demonstrated 
product revenue is recognized upon shipment when the product is classified as mature and the customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment 
revenue related to the fair value of the installation obligation is recognized upon completion of the installation 
products are classified as mature after several different customers have accepted similar systems 
for sales of new products or when the customer acceptance criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment  revenue and the related cost of goods sold are deferred until customer acceptance 
under the sab revenue recognition policy  we defer revenue for transactions that involve newly introduced products or when customers specify acceptance criteria that cannot be demonstrated prior to the shipment 
we have introduced several new systems in fiscal in the past  we experienced significant delays in the introduction of new testers as well as certain enhancements to our existing testers 
as a result  some customers have experienced significant delays in receiving and accepting our testers in production 
delays in introducing a product or delays in our ability to obtain customer acceptance  if they occur in the future  will delay the recognition of revenue and gross profit by us 
allowance for doubtful accounts our sales distribution partners and we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to make required payments 
we record our bad debt expenses as selling  general and administrative expenses 
when we become aware that a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations to us  such as bankruptcy or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  we record a specific allowance to reflect the level of credit risk in the customer s outstanding receivable balance 
in addition  we record additional allowances based on certain percentages of our aged receivable balances 
these percentages are determined by a variety of factors including  but not limited to  current economic trends  historical payment and bad debt write off experience 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of our customers or changes in general economic conditions  and if circumstances related to our customers deteriorate  our estimates of the recoverability of our trade receivables could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if we provide more allowances than we need  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on our actual collection experience 
inventory valuation with the dramatic decline in revenue during fiscal and  we continue to monitor our inventory levels in light of product development changes and expectations of an eventual market upturn 
we wrote off excess and obsolete inventory of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal  we wrote off excess and obsolete inventories of million and million in the second and fourth quarters  respectively 
we may be required to take additional charges for excess and obsolete inventory if the industry downturn causes further reductions to our current inventory valuations or changes our current product development plans 
we evaluate our inventory levels and valuations based on our estimates and forecasts of the next cyclical industry upturn 
these forecasts require us to estimate our ability to sell current and future products in the next industry upturn and compare those estimates with our current inventory levels 
if these forecasts or estimates change  or our product roadmaps change  then we would need to adjust our assessment of the inventory valuations 
at october   approximately and of the inventory balances are for the quartet mixed signal and kalos memory products  respectively 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  consisting primarily of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  and property  plant and equipment  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn  a significant decline in our market value  or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
in assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we write down such assets based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
in addition  significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long lived assets  including replacement cost  economic obsolescence  and the value that could be realized in orderly liquidation 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
warranty accrual we provide reserves for the estimated costs of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we estimate the costs of our warranty obligations based on our historical experience of known product failure rates  use of materials to repair or replace defective products and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
in addition  from time to time  specific warranty accruals may be made if unforeseen technical problems arise 
should our actual experience relative to these factors differ from our estimates  we may be required to record additional warranty reserves 
alternatively  if we provide more reserves than we need  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods 
income taxes when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we show on our consolidated balance sheet 
the net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based upon weighted available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period  we must record a tax expense in our statement of operations 
management must make significant judgments to determine our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
our net deferred tax asset balance as of october  was zero  net of the valuation allowance of million 
we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate future taxable income and our corresponding ability to utilize our deferred tax assets 
the deferred tax assets consist primarily of deductible temporary differences  tax credit carryforwards  and net operating losses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
special charges the current accounting for restructuring costs requires us to record provisions and charges when we have a formal and committed plan 
in connection with these plans  we have recorded estimated expenses for severance and benefit costs  lease cancellations  asset write offs and other restructuring costs 
given the significance of  and the timing of the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of original estimates 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring plans  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
results of operations in august  we completed a merger with ims 
this transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests and  therefore  all prior period consolidated financial statements presented  and the consolidated financial statements as of october  and for the year then ended  were restated as if the merger took place at the beginning of such periods 
the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal years indicated fiscal years ended october  net sales cost of goods sold on net sales cost of goods sold special charges gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of purchased intangible assets in process research and development special charges total operating expenses operating income loss cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax net income loss vs 
net sales 
net sales consist of revenues from the sale of systems  upgrades  spare parts  maintenance contracts and software 
net sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our net sales decreased from million in the first quarter of fiscal to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal during fiscal  our net sales remained relatively low due in significant part to the cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry that is in sharp contrast to the quarterly increases in fiscal international net sales accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
our net sales to the asia pacific region accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively  and thus are subject to the risk of economic instability in that region that materially adversely affected the demand for our products in capital markets in korea and other areas of asia have been highly volatile  resulting from economic and geopolitical instabilities 
these instabilities may reoccur which could materially adversely affect demand for our products 
our net sales by product line in fiscal and consisted of mixed signal logic memory service and software total revenues from software were not material to our operations in fiscal and  representing less than of our net sales in each respective period 
gross margin 
our net gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in fiscal over fiscal is principally due to the million write down of excess inventories recorded during fiscal compared to million in fiscal these charges were recorded as a result of our response to a major downturn in the business outlook for the ate and related semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries in fiscal and continuing through fiscal excluding the write down of excess inventories  our gross margin as a percentage of net sales would have been and in fiscal and  respectively 
excluding the effect of the write downs  the lower gross margins in fiscal were primarily attributed to lower manufacturing absorption resulting from the lower business levels in as well as lower average selling prices during fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
r d expenses decreased in absolute dollars to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting lower headcount and decreased spending in the development of new products  and enhancements of existing product lines 
we currently intend to continue to invest significant resources in the development of new products and enhancements for the foreseeable future and would expect r d expenses to remain significant as a percentage of net sales in fiscal we anticipate a lower absolute fiscal r d dollar expenditure from the levels recorded in fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  a decrease of 
the lower spending in fiscal in absolute dollars was primarily due to lower headcount  salary reductions and lower commission expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses were in fiscal compared to in fiscal  reflecting the decrease in business levels 
we expect sg a expenses for fiscal to be flat to slightly lower in absolute dollars when compared to those recorded in fiscal amortization of purchased goodwill and intangible assets 
amortization of purchased goodwill and intangible asset expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  a decrease of 
the decline was primarily attributable to the year end write off in fiscal of the nms goodwill and intangible assets as well end of life of other intangible assets 
our management made certain assessments with respect to the determination of all identifiable assets to be used in the business as well as research and development activities as of the acquisition date 
each of these activities was evaluated by both interviews and data analysis to determine our state of development and related fair value 
the purchased intangibles consist of developed technology  assembled workforce  customer relationships  trade names and trademarks  patents  and goodwill and they typically have estimated useful lives of three to ten years 
intangible purchased assets are generally evaluated on a market by market basis in making a determination as to whether such assets are impaired or the estimated useful lives are still appropriate 
we evaluate the carrying value of our purchased goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we write down such assets based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital 
special charges 
we recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to excess and obsolete inventory  which was included in the cost of goods sold 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded charges of approximately million  million  and million for severance charges  asset disposals  and lease write offs  respectively  which was included in operating expenses 
these charges were associated with headcount reductions and facility consolidations we implemented in the fourth fiscal quarter 
during the fourth fiscal quarter of  we reduced our headcount by approximately persons 
of this total  approximately were in manufacturing  were in r d and about were in sg a 
as part of this reduction we discontinued our next generation dram ims product and closed the associated ims facilities in switzerland and germany 
we are exiting the ims facility in beaverton  oregon and consolidating these employees into our facility in hillsboro  oregon 
approximately million of this charge required cash during the quarter  million will require cash over the remaining lease terms and the remaining million are non cash write downs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we wrote down our private investments in the fourth fiscal quarter of by approximately million 
these impairment charges are due to the decline in the fair value of these equity and debt investments and were judged to be other than temporary 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a million charge for the impairment of the remaining goodwill and intangible assets associated with the acquisition of dci in january this impairment was based on the planned sale of the subsidiary to its management team effective november interest income 
we generated interest income of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decline in fiscal was primarily due to lower average interest rates in fiscal combined with lower average cash balances when compared to fiscal interest and other expenses 
interest and other expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the higher expense in fiscal is primarily attributable to the million write down of a publicly traded equity security held as an available for sale investment 
this charge was due to the decline in the fair value of this investment and was judged to be other than temporary 
income tax 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal the effective tax rate was greater than the expected federal statutory tax benefit rate of primarily due to the establishment of a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
realization of the company s deferred tax assets depends on the company generating sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and from net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
due to the uncertainty of the timing and the amount of such realization  management concluded that a full valuation allowance was required at october  the effective tax benefit rate was for fiscal the effective tax benefit rate was less than the combined federal and state statutory rate primarily due to non deductible goodwill amortization 
vs 
net sales 
net sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our net sales decreased from million in the first quarter of fiscal to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal during fiscal  our net sales have declined due to what we believe is a cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry that is in sharp contrast to the quarterly increases in fiscal international net sales accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
our net sales to the asia pacific region accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively  and thus are subject to the risk of economic instability in that region that materially adversely affected the demand for our products in capital markets in korea and other areas of asia have been highly volatile  resulting in economic instabilities 
these instabilities may reoccur which could materially adversely affect demand for our products 
our net sales by product line in fiscal and consisted of mixed signal logic memory service and software total the increase in the memory percentage of net sales is attributable principally to sales of the kalos product line 
revenues from software were not material to our operations in fiscal and  representing less than of our net sales in each respective period 
gross margin 
our gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in is principally the result of the million write down of excess inventories recorded during the year 
these charges were recorded as a result of our response to a major downturn in the business outlook for the ate and related semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries in excluding the write down of excess inventories  our gross margin as a percentage of sales would have been in fiscal the lower gross margin excluding the effect of the write down is primarily attributed to lower manufacturing absorption resulting from the lower business levels in as well as lower average selling prices during fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
r d expenses increased in absolute dollars to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting higher investments in the development of new products  and enhancements of existing product lines 
the higher level of spending in fiscal reflects the acquisitions of tmt and mi in fiscal as well as increases in internal r d project expenses 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  a decrease of 
the lower spending in in absolute dollars was primarily due to lower headcount and commission expenses  salary reductions  and periodic company shutdowns during fiscal as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses were in compared to in fiscal  reflecting the decrease in business levels 
amortization of purchased goodwill and intangible assets 
amortization of purchased intangible asset expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of 
in january and february  we purchased dci and the assets of the rabkin group for approximately million 
these acquisitions have resulted in approximately million in quarterly charges for amortization of purchased intangible assets 
in may  we purchased tmt for approximately million  in august we purchased mi for approximately million and credence europa for approximately million  and in october we purchased nms for approximately million 
these acquisitions have resulted in approximately million  million  million  and million  respectively  in quarterly charges for amortization of purchased intangible assets 
special charges 
in the second quarter of fiscal we recorded a charge of approximately million for severance payments and asset disposals associated with headcount reductions we implemented in february these charges were recorded as a result of our response to a major downturn in the business outlook for the ate and related semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries in in the third quarter of fiscal we recorded a further million for severance payments and asset disposals associated with headcount reductions we implemented in may and august in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded an additional million for headcount reductions 
we reduced headcount by more than people during the fiscal year across all functional areas 
severance payments were distributed during the year and the remaining accruals at october  were not significant 
in the second and third quarters of fiscal we recorded charges of approximately million related to fees and expenses associated with the acquisition of ims 
an additional million was recorded in the fourth quarter for the closing of the ims transaction and the integration of its operations with credence and our subsidiary  fluence 
this charge included the write down of million of goodwill and purchased technology intangible assets of opmaxx 
the impairment was recorded based on product decisions for the newly combined operations of fluence and ims 
the elements of the ims acquisition charges are as follows in thousands fees and expenses investment banking  legal  accounting  d o insurance  travel  etc 
write down of tangible and intangible assets lease and liability accruals employee termination benefits in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a million charge for the impairment of the remaining intangible assets associated with the acquisition of nms in october this impairment was based on significant nms employee turnover in fiscal as well as a change in the technological direction of the remaining research and development project that originated in nms 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a million charge for the abandonment of the former tmt facility in sunnyvale  california as these operations were integrated into our fremont  california facilities 
this charge consisted of in estimated future rental payments to be paid through february and million for asset and leasehold improvement write downs 
interest income 
we generated interest income of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the slight decline in fiscal was primarily due to lower average interest rates in fiscal when compared to fiscal interest and other expenses 
interest and other expenses decreased to million from million in fiscal from fiscal  primarily due to lower interest expenses on the convertible subordinated notes that were redeemed in september income tax 
our effective tax benefit rate was for fiscal the effective tax benefit rate was less than the combined federal and state statutory rate primarily due to non deductible goodwill amortization 
the effective tax rate for fiscal of was lower than the combined federal and state statutory rate due to benefits of our foreign sales subsidiary  partially offset by non deductible in process research and development expenses and non deductible goodwill amortization 
liquidity and capital resources in fiscal  net cash used by operating activities was million 
this use of cash was primarily attributable to the net loss before non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  special charges and deferred tax assets of approximately million offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately million 
the net decrease in the operating assets and liabilities was made up of declines in accounts receivable  inventories  and other current assets offset by slight declines in the current liabilities 
net cash received from investing activities during fiscal was million 
this cash was primarily provided by million in sales and maturities of investments offset by the purchases of property and equipment of million 
we purchased a new headquarters facility in milpitas california for million in august net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal of million was primarily due to common stock and treasury stock issued in accordance with our employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
as of october   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale securities  compared with million at october  we expect that our existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investment balances offset by anticipated cash outflow from operations will satisfy our financing requirements in the ordinary course of business for at least the next months 
we have an agreement with a non related leasing company whereby we issued a guaranty in favor of a bank with respect to certain obligations of the leasing company to the bank 
under this agreement  the leasing company agreed to grant to us a security interest to secure the obligations of the leasing company as a result of any payments by us pursuant to the guaranty 
the outstanding debt at october  of the leasing company subject to this guaranty was million 
we believe that because of the relatively long manufacturing cycles of many of our testers and the new products we have introduced and plan to continue to introduce  investments in inventories continue will continue to represent a significant portion of working capital 
significant investments in accounts receivable and inventories continue to subject us to increased risks  and could continue to materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the semiconductor industry has historically been highly cyclical and has experienced downturns  which have had a material adverse effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for automatic test equipment  including equipment manufactured and marketed by us 
in addition  the automatic test equipment industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
it is reasonably possible that events related to the above factors may occur in the near term which would cause a change to our estimate of the net realizable value of receivables  inventories or other assets  and the adequacy of costs accrued for warranty and other liabilities 
see discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates above 
we lease our facilities and some equipment under operating leases that expire periodically through the approximate future minimum lease payments at october  are as follows in thousands committed gross lease payments leases written off in special charges net estimated future lease expense in addition to the lease commitments above  at october   we have open and committed purchase orders totaling approximately million 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 business combinations  or sfas and statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas sfas supercedes apb opinion no 
 business combinations  and eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations  thus requiring that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method 
in addition  in applying the purchase method  sfas changes the criteria for recognizing intangible assets other than goodwill and states that the following criteria should be considered in determining the classification of intangible assets whether the intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights  or whether the intangible asset is separable or dividable from the acquired entity and capable of being sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged 
if neither criteria is met  the intangible assets are classified as goodwill and are not amortized 
we will apply the requirements of sfas to all business combinations initiated after june  as of october   there were no business combinations subject to these requirements 
sfas supercedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets  and provides that goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life will no longer be amortized 
however  these assets must be reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment 
the shift from an amortization approach to an impairment approach applies to all acquisitions completed after june  for which we made none 
total goodwill amortization expense  including impairments  was million in fiscal million in fiscal and million in fiscal we adopted the remaining elements of this new standard in the first quarter of fiscal and therefore ceased goodwill amortization for acquisitions made prior to july  however  it is possible that in the future we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions 
in addition  we will continue to amortize most purchased intangible assets and to assess those assets for impairment as appropriate 
in connection with the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation under sfas  we will perform an assessment of goodwill impairment as of november   the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  we will identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each of them by assigning the assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
we will then have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent that a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  we must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying amount  both of which will be measured as of the date of adoption 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the statement of operations 
as of the date of adoption of sfas on november   we had an unamortized acquired intangible assets balance of approximately million excluding the balance of approximately  for acquired workforce reclassified to goodwill 
as of that date  we also had an unamortized goodwill balance of approximately million 
these balances will be subject to the transitional provisions of sfas and transitional impairment losses that may be recognized upon adoption of sfas and are indeterminable at this time 
the following table shows our financial results as they would have been if we had adopted the non amortization provisions of sfas as of the beginning of fiscal in thousands net income loss as reported before cumulative effect of accounting change amortization of goodwill  net of tax pro forma net income loss in august the fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas sfas supercedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas establishes a single accounting model for assets to be disposed of by sale whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
sfas no 
retains the provisions of apb no 
for presentation of discontinued operations in the income statement  but broadens the presentation to include a component of an entity 
we will adopt sfas effective november  we are currently in the process of determining the anticipated impact of adopting the provisions of sfas in july the fasb approved statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or sfas sfas addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with an exit activity  including restructuring  or with a disposal of long lived assets 
exit activities include  but are not limited to  eliminating or reducing product lines  terminating employees and contracts and relocating manufacturing facilities or personnel 
sfas specifies that a company will record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity only when that liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 
therefore  commitment to an exit plan or a plan of disposal expresses only management s intended future actions and  therefore  does not meet the requirement for recognizing a liability and the related expense 
sfas is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the effect of adoption of sfas is dependent on our related activities subsequent to the date of adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and investment portfolio 
we maintain a strict investment policy  which ensures the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
our investments consist primarily of commercial paper  medium term notes  asset backed securities  us treasury notes and obligations of us government agencies  bank certificates of deposit  auction rate preferred securities  corporate bonds and municipal bonds 
the table below presents notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio in thousands  except percentages 
balance at future maturities of investments held at october  thereafter cash and cash equivalents fixed rate average rate short term investments fixed rate average rate long term investments fixed rate average rate total investment securities average rate equity investments we mitigate default risk by attempting to invest in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and maintains a prudent amount of diversification 
foreign exchange we generate a significant portion of our sales from sales to customers located outside the united states  principally in asia and to a lesser extent europe 
international sales are made mostly to foreign distributors and some foreign subsidiaries and are typically denominated in us dollars and occasionally are denominated in the local currency for european and japanese customers 
the subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  some of our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors
