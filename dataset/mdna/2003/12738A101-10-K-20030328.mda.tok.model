nonperforming loans the following table states the aggregate amount of loans which were nonperforming in nature in thousands december  type loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis    accruing loans past due days or more      renegotiated troubled debt there were no loan concentrations in excess of of total loans at december  however  lending activities are affected by the economic trends within the areas served by the company and its subsidiaries 
this  in turn  can be influenced by the areas larger employers  such as mississippi state university  university of alabama  bryan foods  columbus air force base  and the mercedes benz automotive plant 
there were no outstanding foreign loans at december  loans classified for regulatory purposes or for internal credit review purposes that have not been disclosed in the above table do not represent or result from trends or uncertainties that management expects will materially impact the financial condition of the company or its subsidiary banks  or their future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources 
if all nonaccrual loans had been current throughout their terms  interest income would have not been significantly different for the years ended  and management stringently monitors loans that are classified as nonperforming 
nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans  loans past due days or more  and loans renegotiated or restructured because of a debtor s financial difficulties 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status if any of the following events occur the classification of a loan as nonaccrual internally or by regulatory examiners  delinquency on principal for days or more unless management is in the process of collection  a balance remains after repossession of collateral  notification of bankruptcy  or management s judgment that nonaccrual is appropriate 
at december   the recorded investment in loans identified as impaired totaled approximately million 
the allowance for loan losses related to these loans approxi mated  the average recorded investment in impaired loans during the year ended december   was million

summary of loan loss experience a 
an analysis of the loan loss experience for the periods indicated is as follows in thousands december  beginning balance      charge offs domestic commercial  financial and agricultural  real estate  installment loans and other     total charge offs      recoveries domestic commercial  financial and agricultural real estate installment loans and other total recoveries net charge offs      provision charged to operations      ending balance      ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding 




ratio of allowance for loan losses to loans outstanding at year end b 
determination of allowance for loan losses the determination of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment 
the balance of the allowance for loan losses reflects management s best estimate of probable loan losses related to specifically identified loans  as well as probable incurred loan losses in the remaining portfolio 
reference should be made to note a to the consolidated financial statements included herein as item and to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following schedule sets forth the components of the allowance for loan losses at december  and this allocation is based upon the consistent  quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb loan losses in any category 
allowance allowance loan for loan loan for loan balance losses balance losses in thousands allocated component impaired loans    graded loans     homogeneous pools    other loans     unallocated component the allowance allocated to impaired loans for the years and was based upon the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral 
graded loans are those loans that exhibit some form of weakness 
allocations to this group are based upon the historical loan loss experience of the grades assigned and upon specific allocations to specific loans 
an allowance is allocated to the various pools of loans considered to be homogenous based upon the historical loan losses of each pool 
other loans consist of those loans not graded or impaired or considered homogenous 
these loans are grouped by risk assignments which are based upon consideration of collateral values  borrower financial condition and performance  debt service capacity  cash flows  market share  and other indicators 
allocations of the allowance to these loans are based upon historical loan loss experience of the risk assignment 
c 
loans and risk descriptions real estate loans nbc originates loans secured by commercial real estate  one to four family residential properties  and multi family dwelling units or more units 
at december   these loans totaled million or approximately of the loan portfolio 
nbc originates commercial real estate loans up to of the appraised value 
currently  it is the philosophy to originate these loans only to selected known borrowers and on properties in the market area 
of primary concern in commercial real estate lending is the borrower s credit worthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project 
to monitor cash flows of borrowers  annual financial statements are obtained from the borrower and loan guarantors  if any 
although many banks have had significant losses in commercial real estate lending  nbc  historically  has sustained few losses  and those losses were not significant relative to the size of the entire commercial real estate loan portfolio at the time 
nbc originates loans secured by first and junior liens on one to four family residences in their lending areas 
typically  such loans are single family homes that serve as the primary residence of the borrower 
generally  these loans are originated in amounts up to of the appraised value or selling price of the property 
in the past  very few losses from these types of loans have been experienced 
loans for multi family or more residential properties are generally secured by apartment buildings 
loans secured by income properties are generally larger and involve greater risk than residential loans because payments are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties 
as a result  these types of loans may be more sensitive to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy 
cash flow and financial statements are obtained from the borrowers and any guarantors 
also  rent rolls are often obtained 
consumer and other loans nbc offers consumer loans in the form of home improvement loans  mobile home loans  automobile loans and unsecured personal loans 
these loans totaled million or of total loans at december  consumer loans are originated in order to provide a wide range of financial services to customers and because the terms and normally higher interest rates on such loans help maintain a profitable spread between the average loan yield and the cost of funds 
in connection with consumer loan applications  the borrower s income statement and credit bureau report are reviewed 
in addition  the relationship of the loan to the value of the collateral is considered 
all automobile loan applications are reviewed  as well as the value of the unit which secured the loan 
nbc intends to continue to emphasize the origination of consumer loans 
management believes that its loan loss experience in connection with its consumer loan portfolio is favorable in comparison to industry averages 
nbc makes commercial business loans on both a secured and unsecured basis with terms which generally do not exceed five years 
non real estate commercial loans primarily consist of short term loans for working capital purposes  inventories  seasonal loans  lines of credit and equipment loans 
a personal guaranty of payment by the principals of any borrowing entity is often required and the financial statements and income tax returns of the entity and its guarantors are reviewed 
at december   nbc s commercial business loans represented approximately of its total loan portfolio 
d 
in the year  nbc experienced an unusual and unexpected loan loss of million reference should be made to item manage ment s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  which is included in the commercial  financial and agricultural category in table iva loan losses in for all loan categories  as a percentage of average loans  are expected to approximate that of v

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following provides a narrative discussion and analysis of significant changes in the corporation s results of operations and financial condition 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  and the supplemental financial data included elsewhere in this report  including the five year summary of selected financial data and management s letter to shareholders at the beginning of this annual report 
certain information included in this discussion contains forward looking statements and information that are based on management s conclusions  drawn from certain assumptions and information currently available 
the private securities litigation act of encourages the disclosure of forward looking information by management by providing a safe harbor for such information 
this discussion includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
although the corporation believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  such forward looking statements are based on numerous assumptions some of which may prove to be incorrect and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the corporation s expectations 
the forward looking statements made in this document are based on management s beliefs  as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management 
when used in the corporation s documents  the words anticipate  estimate  expect  objective  projection  forecast  goal and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
in addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with forward looking statements  factors that could cause the corporation s actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in any forward looking statements include  among others  increased competition  regulatory factors  economic conditions  changing interest rates  changing market conditions  availability or cost of capital  employee workforce factors  cost and other effects of legal and administrative proceedings  and changes in federal  state or local laws and regulations 
the corporation undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of changes in actual results  changes in assumptions or other factors affecting such statements 
the two major trends that can have a material impact on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations are the trend in interest rates and the overall trend in the economy 
currently  management expects  based on the available information  that interest rates will remain at their current levels during the first half of and trend upward slightly during the latter half of the year  and the overall economy in its market will remain relatively flat throughout the year 
the corporation s projections  budgets and goals are based on these expectations 
if these trends move differently than expected in either direction or speed  it could have a material impact on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the areas of the corporation s operations most directly impacted would be the net interest margin  loan and deposit growth and the provision for loan losses 
accounting issues note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the corporation s accounting policies 
management is of the opinion that note a  read in conjunction with all other information in the annual report  including management s letter to shareholders and management s discussion and analysis  is sufficient to provide the reader with the information needed to understand the corporation s financial condition and results of operations and to identify the areas in which management is required to make the most difficult  subjective and or complex judgments 
in the normal course of business  the corporation s wholly owned subsidiary  national bank of commerce  makes loans to related parties  including directors and executive officers of the corporation and their relatives and affiliates 
these loans are made on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other parties 
also  they are consistent with sound banking practices and within the applicable regulatory and lending limitations 
see note o in the notes to consolidated financial statement and the corporation s proxy statement for additional details concerning related party transactions 
under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  loans to executive officers are generally prohibited 
however  the rule does not apply to any loan made or maintained by an insured depository institution if the loan is subject to the insider lending restrictions of section h of the federal reserve act 
all loans to executive officers made by the corporation s bank subsidiary are subject to the above referenced section of the federal reserve act 
note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a listing of all the corporation s affiliated companies 
the corporation does not have investments in any unconsolidated entities over which it exercises management or control 
the corporation does not have relationships with limited or special purpose entities that it relies on to provide financing  liquidity or market and credit risk support 
effective january   the corporation adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement eliminated the requirement to amortize goodwill  however  it does require periodic testing for impairment 
as a result of the adoption of the statement  the corporation did not amortize goodwill during the corporation completed its transitional impairment test in accordance with statement no 
in january no significant impairment write down was recorded as a result of that test 
additionally  the corporation adopted fasb statement no 
 acquisition of certain financial institutions which became effective october  this statement applies to unidentified intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of less than whole financial institutions 
the corporation s unidentified intangible asset resulted from such an acquisition 
management determined that the acquisition met the requirements of a business combination and  in accordance with fasb statement no 
 the related unidentified intangible asset was reclassified as goodwill and accounted for in accordance with fasb statement no 
as a result  the corporation reversed all related amortization expense recognized after fasb statement no 
was applied 
this reversal required the corporation to restate each of the first three quarters of  by reversing the previously recorded amortization 
this reversal reduced each quarter s other operating expense by  and caused net income in each quarter to increase by approximately  this change did not cause the earnings per share to change in any quarter 
at december   the corporation had approximately million of goodwill on its balance sheet  including approximately  of unidentified intangible assets reclassified as goodwill  which will remain at that level unless it becomes impaired under the definition of impairment in fas the amortization of goodwill during and was approximately  or 
per share and  or 
per share  respectively 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the cost associated with exit or disposal activities 
the adoption of the statement is not expected to have a material impact on the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
financial condition and results of operations since  the total assets of the corporation have increased 
during this same period  loans have increased  while deposits grew by 
during  net loans grew by million  while deposits declined by approximately million 
approximately of this decline in deposits occurred during the last sixty days of this situation required the corporation to look to other funding sources such as reallocating funds from lower yielding assets and additional borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
during  this trend reversed as the equity markets turned down and cash began flowing back into the banking system 
as a result  the corporation was able to fund its net loan growth of approximately million with a growth in deposits of approximately million 
during  net loans declined by million  mostly as a result of a decline in the adjustable rate mortgage arm loans that the corporation carried in its loan portfolio 
the reason for the decline was the interest rate environment 
during that period the federal reserve lowered rates eleven times  totaling 
because of these lower rates  many homeowners refinanced their existing arm loans to fixed rate loans 
due to the interest rate risk  the corporation does not normally carry fixed rate mortgage loans on its books 
as a result of this decline in loans and an overall soft loan demand  the corporation did not need to aggressively price deposits  and therefore  had a modest million growth in deposits during the year 
this interest rate environment continued into  as the rates remained at historically low levels  actually declining an additional basis points in november 
the mortgage refinancing trend continued throughout  and as a result  the corporation s mortgage loan portfolio declined further 
also  the softness in the economy and the very low  or in the case of the auto industry  zero rate loans resulted in an overall decline in the corporation s consumer loan portfolio 
even though other parts of the loan portfolio actually increased during the year  the increase was not enough to offset the decline in the mortgage and consumer portfolios 
as a result  the corporation experienced its second consecutive year of a declining loan portfolio  as loans decreased by 
with this continued decline in loans  the corporation continued its position of not aggressively pricing deposits 
as a result  deposits grew by 
for the year 
see the section entitled liquidity  asset liability management for additional comments on sources and uses of cash during shareholders equity has represented a consistent strength of the corporation throughout the years  as noted in the summary of selected financial data 
shareholders equity has decreased slightly since during and  shareholder s equity increased from million to million  or 
the decline in resulted primarily from the purchase of approximately million of outstanding shares owned beneficially by two long time shareholders at per share post split price 
this purchase was partially offset by income  net of dividend  and an increase in the market value of available for sale securities  the cumulative effect of which caused accumulated other comprehensive income to increase by approximately million 
in  shareholders equity increased by million  or from million to million 
this increase came from income  net of dividends  and a million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income 
accumulated other comprehensive income is composed of unrealized gains losses  net of taxes on available for sale securities  and  at december  and  respectively and is reported as part of shareholders equity  as required under fasb in  net income increased by  even though the corporation incurred approximately million of merger related expenses net of taxes associated with the acquisitions of ffbs bancorp  inc  ffbs and galloway chandler mckinney insurance agency  inc gcm 
in and  fully diluted earnings per share were and  respectively  after being impacted by approximately 
in and 
in  of non recurring merger costs 
in  fully diluted earnings per share increased by to per share  as net income increased from million in to million in in  net income declined to million  however  fully diluted earnings per share increased to  a increase  due to fewer weighted average shares outstanding as a result of the previously mentioned repurchase of the corporation s stock 
in  net income was negatively impacted by an additional million provision made to the corporation s allowance for loan losses to replenish the allowance for a large commercial loan charge off 
this charge off will discussed in more detail later in this analysis 
the following paragraphs discuss the increase in net income in  compared to the earnings per share amounts have been restated to reflect the merger with ffbs 
all earnings per share amounts have been restated to reflect the four for three stock split  accounted for as a stock dividend  that occurred during the third quarter of regular cash dividends have increased in each of the years outlined in the summary of selected financial data 
the dividends per share amount has been restated to reflect the merger with ffbs and all dividends per share have been restated to reflect the four for three stock split  accounted for as a stock dividend  that occurred during the third quarter of net interest income nii  the primary source of earnings for the corporation  represents income generated from earning assets  less the interest expense of funding those assets 
nii declined by in and increased by in changes in nii may be divided into two components  first  the change in average earning assets volume component and second  the change in the net interest spread rate component 
net interest spread represents the difference between yields on earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the year was a unique year for the banking industry 
during the year  the federal reserve reduced interest rates eleven times  for a total of basis points 
even though most thought rates would decline during  few  if any  expected rates to decline that far  that fast 
this rate decline did not stop the general state of the economy from continuing to slow throughout the year 
with this slow down in the economy  the corporation experienced a substantial decline in loan demand  as businesses went into a defensive position 
in this environment  the competition for quality credits increased 
this situation caused many of the fixed rate loans that were in the portfolio to be refinanced at lower rates during the year 
also  at the beginning of the year  approximately percent of the loan portfolio was composed of variable rate loans 
these two factors caused an overall decline in loan yields during as mentioned later in this discussion  the corporation s policy is to maintain a basically neutral gap position for its balance sheet 
the corporation began with a twelve month liability sensitive position of million or of assets  well within its policy of plus or minus 
even though a liability sensitive position was appropriate for this declining rate environment  the speed and amount of the declines caused the variable loans to reprice more quickly than the cost of liabilities could be reduced  putting a great deal of downward pressure on the corporation s margin during the year 
even though management began repricing deposits downward during january  it was the third and fourth quarters before the rates stabilized enough for the reduction in rates paid on deposit to catch up with the decline in yields and for the margin to stabilize and begin to increase 
in  nii declined as the net interest spread declined from in to 
the primary reason for this decline was a decrease in average loan yields of approximately basis points 
this decrease in loan yields was partially offset by a decrease in the average cost of deposits of basis points and a decrease in the cost of other borrowed funds of basis points 
the volume component of nii also helped offset this decline in loan yields  as average earning assets grew million  or 
in  nii increased by from million to million 
this increase resulted from improvement in both the rate and volume components of nii 
during the year the margin increased from in to in even though yields on earning assets continued to decline during the year  the corporation was able to more than offset the decline by continuing to decease the cost of funds during the stable rate  low loan demand environment of as can be seen in following table  yields on earning assets declined by basis points from to 
this loss was more that offset by a decline of basis points in cost of funds from in to in also  the corporation was able to grow earning assets by million or during all of this growth came in the area of investment securities 
if rates were to continue downward  it will become very difficult for the corporation to continue to lower deposit rates much below their current level 
as a result  if multiple rate reductions occur  the margin will again come under extreme pressure because asset yields will be decreasing and the corporation s ability to reduce its deposit cost will be limited 
the table below shows  for the periods indicated  an analysis of nii  including the average amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding during the period  the interest earned or paid on such amounts  the average yields rates paid and the net yield on interest earning assets on both a book and tax equivalent basis in thousands average balance year year ended ended earning assets loans   federal funds sold and other interest bearing assets   securities taxable   nontaxable   totals   interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits   borrowed funds  federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other   totals   in thousands interest yields earned for and rates paid year year year year ended ended ended ended earning assets loans   federal funds sold and other interest bearing assets securities taxable   nontaxable   totals   interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits   borrowed funds  federal funds sold  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other   totals   net interest income   net yield on earning assets note yields on a tax equivalent basis would be nontaxable securities total earning assets net yield on earning assets the corporation s provision for loan losses is utilized to replenish the reserve for loan losses on its balance sheet 
the reserve is maintained at a level deemed adequate by the board of directors  after its evaluation of the risk exposure contained in the corporation s loan portfolio 
the methodology used to make this determination is performed on a quarterly basis by the senior credit officers and the loan review staff 
as a part of this evaluation  certain loans are individually reviewed to determine if there is an impairment of the bank s ability to collect the loan and the related interest 
this determination is generally made based on collateral value 
if it is determined that an impairment exists  a specific portion of the reserve is allocated to these individual loans 
all other loans are grouped into homogeneous pools  and risk exposure is determined by considering the following list of factors this list is not all inclusive and the factors reviewed may change as circumstances change historical loss experiences  trends in delinquencies and non accruals  and national  regional and local economic conditions 
these economic conditions would include  but not be limited to  general real estate conditions  the current interest rate environment and trends  unemployment levels and other information  as deemed appropriate 
even though there has been increased competition for good quality credits in the corporation s market  the quality of our portfolio remains strong 
net charge offs for  and were  
and 
of average net loans outstanding for each year  respectively 
see note d in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the transactions in the reserve for loan losses for the three year period ended december  had it not been for a single million loan charged off in june of this loan will be discussed in more detail in the following paragraph  the ratio for would have been 
of average net loans 
the ratio of classified loans to capital has decreased from at december  to at december  the reserve for loan losses as a percentage of total loans has declined from of total loans at the end of to at the end of based on these evaluations  the reserve amounts maintained at the end of and were deemed adequate to cover exposure within the corporation s loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses increased from  in to  in and to  in in  the provision was increased to  as net charge offs increased from million in to million in the primary reason for the increased charge offs in was that in june  the corporation charged off a million commercial loan that defaulted 
this loan had previously not been classified as a problem loan and there were special circumstances surrounding the default 
the corporation has filed a claim with its bonding company to recover the entire million  however  it can not predict whether there will be a recovery 
in  the provision was increased to  in total  the net charge offs decreased to million in however  when compared to  exclusive of the special charge off  the level of charge offs actually increased in this increase can be attributed to the overall condition of the economy and the continued softening in the market  especially in the consumer sector 
due to this continued softness in the economy and the forecast of a long  slow recovery  management intends to again increase the provision for loan losses in to a level that we anticipate will protect the corporation from any unforeseen deterioration in the quality of the loan portfolio 
non interest income includes various service charges  fees and commissions collected by the corporation  including insurance commissions earned by gcm  the wholly owned insurance agency subsidiary of national bank of commerce 
during  non interest income grew from million to million 
this increase resulted from the corporation s continued focus on diversifying its income sources so that it can be less dependent on net interest income 
approximately of the total increase came from a million or a increase in service charges on deposit accounts 
this increase resulted primarily from an upgrade in the technology platform that includes more sophisticated account modeling 
this gave management the tools needed to better monitor and more uniformly apply the account based fees across all deposit accounts on a consistent basis 
insurance commissions  fees and premiums increased by  or 
this change in insurance commissions  fees and premiums relates directly to the volume of insurance product sold during these periods 
other service charges and fees also increased by  or 
this increase came from three areas 
first  mortgage loan fee income increased by  to a level of  mortgage activity benefited from the continued demand for loans in this low interest rate environment 
also the demand for mortgage refinancing  which had moderated during the first half of the year  began to increase once again during the last half of the year as interest rates fell 
also  during the year  the demand for new loans was strong 
with this high level of activity at year end  the pipeline for both new and refinanced mortgage loans remains strong going into the other two areas that caused the increase in other service charges and fees were atm income  which increased by  and check card income  which increased by 
trust department income increased by to million 
even though the trust department was able to continue to grow its assets under management during the year  its income is generated based on the market value of these assets 
therefore  its growth in income was limited by the overall conditions in the equity markets as they continued to decline throughout during  non interest income grew to million 
several different sources contributed to this increase 
service charges on deposit accounts increased by to million as a result of an on going effort by management to better bill and collect fees 
the corporation s trust department income increased by to million 
this increase was smaller than the prior year s increase 
the activities in this area grew steadily during  however  as mentioned  the amount of income collected from management fees is directly related to the market value of the account assets  which in many cases was negatively impacted by the decline in the equity markets during additionally  other non interest income increased by million  or 
this increase came primarily from two sources 
first  the fees from mortgage related activities increased  or  as a result of an interest rate environment that produced heavy refinancing activity throughout the year 
second  earnings from a million purchase of bank owned life insurance boli caused this category of other non interest income to increase by  this purchase of boli was executed to help cover the increasing cost of employee benefits 
these increases were partially offset by a decline of  or  in insurance commissions  fees and premiums 
this decline in insurance commissions  fees and premiums relates directly to the volume of insurance products sold 
during the first quarter of  a great deal of time and effort was spent handling claims that resulted from a major storm that hit the service area 
this took away from time that would have been spent developing new business 
also  gcm experienced a reduction in incentive rebates from its insurance carriers because of underwriting losses that resulted from the storm 
the corporation recognized  in securities gains during  compared to  in and a loss of  for approximately of the gain came in the second half of the year 
with approximately of available for sale securities portfolio composed of mortgage backed securities  a unique situation developed during the second half of as mortgage rates continued to stay low during most of and then drop again with the fed rate cut in november  the prepayment speed on the mortgages behind these securities increased 
this caused the average lives on these securities to shorten from the to year ranges they were in when purchased  to ranges of to years 
with the low interest rate environment there was a high demand for securities with to year estimated average life 
this gave the corporation the opportunity to sell these securities at a profit and replace them with securities with the same to year average life that were originally purchased 
not only did these transactions create a gain  they also allowed the corporation to improve the yields on the particular securities sold by approximately basis points 
this environment continued into  and the corporation intends to take advantage of this situation for as long as it exists 
the gain in resulted primarily from several securities that had been purchased at a discount being called  at par value  because of the low interest rate environment 
non interest expense represents ordinary overhead expenses  including salaries  bonuses and benefits 
the corporation maintains a formal salary administration program that considers extensive comparative salary data and other indices supplied by a leading outside consulting firm 
this data is utilized to assure that salaries are in line and competitive with comparable jobs in the marketplace 
incentive bonuses that were expensed in and were paid to employees based on the attainment of predetermined profit goals 
the predetermined profit goals were not reached in  therefore  no significant bonuses were accrued 
overall  non interest expense increased by approximately million or   during this entire increase can be attributed to increases in salaries and benefits 
salaries increased by  or million 
approximately of this increase came from bonuses and related expenses that were accrued in as stated above  no bonuses were accrued in the remaining portion of the salary increase is due to normal salary increases for the year 
employee benefits increased by  or  in like most companies  nbc experienced an increase in medical insurance premiums during the year 
also  the benefit cost increased due the effects on the defined benefit plan of the lower rate environment on the present value calculations and low returns in the plan s investment portfolio due to the weak equity markets 
additionally  net occupancy expense and furniture and equipment expense increased by  or 
this small increase came primarily from higher maintenance and repair cost during the year 
these increases were partially offset by a  or  decrease in other expenses 
during  non interest expense increased by approximately million or  
this increase resulted primarily from a  or  increase in salaries and employee benefits and a  or  increase in other operating expenses 
salaries and employee benefits increased as the result of an increase in employee benefit cost and a reduction in the fasb deferral because of the reduction in loan volume 
salaries were basically unchanged during the year 
the corporation made significant changes in its employee benefits that became effective at the beginning of management knew that these changes would increase the cost of benefits in the early years  but would eventually allow management to better control and possibly reduce the cost of benefits in future years 
to offset these increases  the corporation purchased the bank owned life insurance 
the increase in other operating expenses resulted from increases in several expense categories  none of which were individually considered to be material 
changes in the corporation s income tax expense have generally paralleled changes in pre tax income 
the corporation s effective tax rates were in  in and in the small increase in the effective tax rate in resulted from a million dollar decrease in the average balance of assets that provide either tax free or tax advantaged earnings 
the decrease in the effective rate in resulted from a million increase in the average balance of assets that provide either tax free or tax advantaged earnings 
the corporation s ability to reduce income tax expense by acquiring additional tax free investments is limited by the alternative minimum tax provision  the market supply of acceptable municipal securities  the level of tax exempt yields and the corporation s normal liquidity and balance sheet structure requirements 
liquidity  asset liability management liquidity may be defined as the ability of the corporation to meet cash flow requirements created by decreases in deposits and or other sources of funds or increases in loan demand 
the corporation has not experienced any problems with liquidity over any of the years noted  and anticipates that all liquidity requirements will be met comfortably in the future 
the corporation s traditional sources of funds from deposit increases  maturing loans and investments and earnings have generally allowed it to consistently generate sufficient funds for liquidity needs 
as the result of a million decrease in loans and a million increase in deposits  the corporation s loan deposit ratio has decreased from in to in in addition  the corporation increased its borrowing from the federal home loan bank during by approximately million and other borrowed funds by million 
with the very soft loan demand  this positive flow of funds was used primarily to purchase additional investment securities 
during  the investment security portfolio increased from million to million  representing a million  or  increase 
an additional million was placed in federal funds sold 
all the remaining liquidity needs for the year were provided from normal operating activities 
the corporation offers repurchase agreements to accommodate excess funds of some of its larger depositors 
management believes that these repurchase agreements stabilize traditional deposit sources as opposed to risking the potential loss of these funds to alternative investment arrangements 
repurchase agreements  which are viewed as a source of funds to the corporation  totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the level of repurchase agreement activity is limited by the availability of investment portfolio securities to be pledged against the accounts 
due to the limited amount of repurchase agreements and the fact that the underlying securities remain under the control of national bank of commerce  the exposure of the corporation for this service is not considered material 
the following table shows the contractual obligations for the corporation as of december  obligations due in less due in due in due than after in thousands total year years years years long term debt      operating leases   securities sold under repurchase agreements   other borrowings   total cash obligations      the following table shows the other commercial commitments for the corporation as of december  commercial commitments expires in less expires expires expires than in in after in thousands total year years years years lines of credit unfunded commitments      commercial and similar letters of credit     the corporation believes that normal earnings and other traditional sources of cash flow  along with additional borrowings from the federal home loan bank  if necessary  will provide the cash to allow it to meet these obligations with no adverse effect on liquidity 
at december   the corporation had the ability to borrow approximately million from the federal home loan bank and had other short term borrowing lines federal funds purchased lines of approximately million from upstream correspondent banks 
the corporation has no plans for the refinancing or redemption of any liabilities other than normal maturities and payments relating to the borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
the corporation does not have plans at this time for any discretionary spending that would have a material impact on liquidity other than its announced stock repurchase program 
at december   the corporation had the authority  at its discretion  to purchase  additional shares of its common stock 
if purchased at the year end closing price of  this purchase would require approximately million 
any purchases under this program will be made over an unknown period of time  and the necessary funds will be provided from normal sources 
under regulations controlling financial holding companies and national banks  the bank is limited in the amount it can lend to the corporation and such loans are required to be on a fully secured basis 
at december   there were no borrowings between the corporation and its subsidiary bank 
the corporation has maintained a consistent and disciplined asset liability management policy during each of the years noted in the summary 
this policy focuses on interest rate risk and sensitivity 
during  the corporation did not engage in any non exchange traded contracts such as currency or interest rate swaps  nor did it purchase or hold any derivative securities 
the primary objective of rate sensitivity management is to maintain net interest income growth while reducing exposure to adverse fluctuations in rates 
the corporation utilizes an asset liability management committee that evaluates and analyzes the corporation s pricing  asset liability maturities and growth  and balance sheet mix strategies in an effort to make informed decisions that will increase income and limit interest rate risk 
the committee uses simulation modeling as a guide for its decision making 
modeling techniques are also utilized to forecast changes in net income and the economic value of equity under assumed fluctuations in interest rate levels 
due to the potential volatility of interest rates  the corporation s goal is to stabilize the net interest margin by maintaining a neutral rate sensitive position 
at year end  the corporation s balance sheet reflected approximately million more in rate sensitive assets than liabilities that were scheduled to reprice within one year 
this represents of total assets and would indicate that the corporation is slightly asset sensitive 
this computation results from a static gap analysis that weights assets and liabilities equally 
it is the corporation s policy to maintain a static gap position of no more than a plus or minus of aggregate assets over a moving twenty four month period 
the corporation s position is considered essentially neutral when using simulation modeling that provides different weighting for assets and liabilities 
management believes that interest rates will increase slightly during the second half of as a result  it is felt that the corporation s current position places it in the correct interest rate risk posture for a rising rate environment 
management does not believe that it is in the corporation s best interest to speculate on changes in interest rate levels 
although earnings could be enhanced if predictions were correct  they could also be put at significant risk if interest rates move against predictions 
capital retained earnings have served as the corporation s exclusive source of capital growth over the five years noted in the summary of selected financial data 
in  total stockholders equity showed a decline of approximately  the reason for this decline was that accumulated other comprehensive income  which is composed primarily of unrealized gains losses on available for sale securities  moved from a gain of million in to a loss of million in this movement resulted from an increasing rate environment during  which caused a decline in market value of these investment securities 
the interest rate trend reversed in  and as a result  the accumulated other comprehensive income improved from a loss of million to a loss of only  this  along with net income  net of dividends  resulted in stockholder s equity increasing from million at the end of to million at the end of in  shareholder s equity decreased by million or 
this decrease resulted from a large repurchase of stock during the first quarter and the normal payment of dividends 
these decreases were partially offset by the net income for the year and a continued downward trend in interest rates  which caused the accumulated other comprehensive income to increase from a loss of  at december  to a gain of  at december  in  shareholders equity increased by million from million to million 
this represented an increase of 
this increase came primarily from two sources 
first  the corporation generated net income of million  from which it paid approximately million in dividends 
the second primary cause of this increase was that the interest rate climate continued downward during  causing the market value of the available for sale securities to increase 
as a result  accumulated other comprehensive income increased from  at december  to  at december  offsetting these increases was the purchase of approximately million in treasury stock 
common stock also shows an increase of approximately million 
however  this was the result of a four for three stock split  accounted for as a stock dividend  during the third quarter of this increase in common stock was offset by a charge to retained earnings and had no impact on total shareholders equity 
during  the amount of treasury stock increased from  to  as the number of shares held in the treasury increased from  to  this increase in the shares held in treasury stock came from stock purchased through the repurchase program first announced in july of and extended in july of the initial plan approved the repurchase of  shares or up to of the common stock 
this total increased to  as the result of the four for three stock split that occurred during the third quarter of during   shares were purchased under this program prior to the above referenced stock split for approximately  or an average of per share on a pre split basis 
as a result of the split   of additional shares were placed in treasury stock at no additional cost 
following the split  an additional  shares were purchased under the repurchase plan for approximately  or an average price of 
on a post split basis  the average purchase price of stock purchased during was per share 
during fourth quarter   shares were purchased at an average price of per share 
also during  the corporation issued  shares upon the exercise of stock options granted under a plan carried over from ffbs 
at december   the corporation could purchase an additional  shares under its stock repurchase program 
during the year ended december   the corporation used sterne  agee leach  inc and ftn financial securities corp 
to purchase these shares under the stock repurchase plan in the open market in accordance with securities and exchange commission rule b current regulatory requirements call for a basic leverage ratio of for an institution to be considered well capitalized 
at the end of  nbc maintained a leverage ratio  which means it significantly exceeded the ratio required for a well capitalized institution 
regulatory authorities also evaluate a financial institution s capital under certain risk weighted formulas high risk assets would require a higher capital allotment  lower risk assets a lower capital allotment 
in this context  a well capitalized bank is required to have a tier risk based capital ratio excludes reserve for loan losses of and a total risk based capital ratio includes reserve for loan losses of 
at the end of  the corporation had a tier ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of  again placing the corporation well above the level required for a well capitalized institution 
the corporation s capital position obviously exceeds regulatory requirements  even for well capitalized institutions 
even though capital has decreased since and assets grew by  the capital to asset ratio remained high at  as of december  management still considers this level of capital to be excessive in relation to the amount needed to support the assets of the corporation 
as a result  management is continuing to consider alternatives to safely leverage the remaining excess capital in an effort to increase the earnings of the corporation and improve return on average equity 
some of the items under consideration are the additional purchase of the corporation s stock  acquisitions and additional arbitrage transactions 
there are no material commitments for the use of capital resources that cannot be funded through currently available liquidity sources

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed only to us dollar interest rate changes and  accordingly  the company manages exposure by considering the possible changes in the net interest margin 
the company does not have any trading instruments nor does it classify any portion of the investment portfolio as held for trading 
the company does not engage in any hedging activities or enter into any derivative instruments with a higher degree of risk than collateralized mortgage obligations which are commonly held securities generally collateralized by pools of gnma  fnma  or fhlmc pass through securities 
finally  the company has no exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  and other market risks 
the following table reflects the year end position of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which can either reprice or mature within the designated time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gaps can vary from day to day and are not necessarily a reflection of the future 
in addition  certain assets and liabilities within the same designated time period may nonetheless reprice at different times and at different levels 
in thousands december  interest sensitive within cumulative total of within within within interest earning months months years assets interest earning assets loans     investment and mortgage backed securities     federal funds sold and other     totals     interest bearing liabilities deposits     borrowed funds     sensitivity gap dollar amount     percent of total interest earning assets the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing within a specific time frame exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing within that same time frame 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
in a rising interest rate environment  an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater increase in the yield of its assets relative to the costs of its liabilities and thus an increase in the institution s net interest income would result whereas an institution with a negative gap could experience the opposite results 
at december   total interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year were more than interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same time period by approximately million cumulative  representing a positive cumulative one year gap of of earning assets 
management of the company believes this position to be acceptable in the current interest rate environment 
banking regulators have issued advisories concerning the management of interest rate risk irr 
the regulators consider that effective interest rate management is an essential component of safe and sound banking practices 
to monitor its irr  the company s risk management practices include a risk management  b risk monitoring and c risk control 
risk management consists of a system in which a measurement is taken of the amount of earnings at risk when interest rates change 
the company does this by first preparing a base strategy which is the position of the bank and its forecasted earnings based upon the current interest rate environment or  most likely  interest rate environment 
the irr is then measured based upon hypothetical changes in interest rates by measuring the impact such a change will have on the base strategy 
risk monitoring consists of evaluating the base strategy and the assumptions used in its development based upon the current interest rate environment 
this evaluation is performed quarterly by management or more often in a rapidly changing interest rate situation and monitored by an asset liability management committee 
risk control is utilized based upon the setting of guidelines as to the tolerance for interest rate exposure 
these guidelines are set by senior management and approved by the board of directors 
assuming a basis points increase over the next twelve months  the december   model reflects net income declining by 
a basis points decline would result in an decrease in net income 
utilizing a rate shock model  a basis point increase in interest rates results in a decrease in market value equity  and a basis point decrease results in a increase in market value equity 
the guidelines allow for no more than a change in income  and no more than a change in market value equity 
however  at december   management believes the changes in income and market value equity as reflected in the models are acceptable in the current rate environment
