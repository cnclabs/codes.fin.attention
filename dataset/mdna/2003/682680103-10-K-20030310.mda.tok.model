interest rate risk we are subject to the risk of fluctuation in interest rates in the normal course of business 
we manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt  floating rate debt and  at times  interest rate swaps 
fixed rate swaps are used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates 
floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates 
at december   the interest rate on percent of our debt was fixed  after considering the effect of interest rate swaps 
in july  we entered into interest rate swaps on a total of million in fixed rate long term debt 
the interest rate under these swaps resets periodically based on the three month libor or the six month libor at the reset date 
in october  we entered into an agreement to lock in the interest rates for each reset period under the swap agreements through the first quarter of in december  we entered into additional interest rate swaps on a total of million in fixed rate long term debt 
in january  the rates were locked through the first quarter of the swaps resulted in approximately million of interest rate savings in and will result in an estimated million in savings during in december  we recorded a million net increase in price risk management assets to recognize at fair value our derivatives that are designated as fair value hedging instruments 
long term debt was increased by approximately million to recognize the change in fair value of the related hedged liability 
at december  a hypothetical basis point move in the annual interest rate would change our annual interest expense by million before taxes 
this amount is limited based on the libor locks that we have in place through the first quarter of if these locks were not in place  a basis point change in the interest rates would affect our annual interest expense by million before taxes 
this basis point change assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve 
if interest rates changed significantly  we would take actions to manage our exposure to the change 
since a specific action and the possible effects are uncertain  no change has been assumed 
value at risk disclosure of market risk we measure entity wide market risk in our trading  price risk management  and our non trading portfolios using value at risk var 
our var calculations are based on the risk works monte carlo approach  assuming a one day holding period 
we began using the monte carlo approach in the second quarter of prior to that time  we used the variance co variance approach 
the quantification of market risk using var provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products with different risk factors in order to set overall risk tolerance  to determine risk targets and set position limits 
the use of this methodology requires a number of key assumptions  including the selection of a confidence level and the holding period to liquidation 
inputs to the calculation include prices  positions  instrument valuations and the variance co variance matrix 
historical data is used to estimate our var with more weight given to recent data  which is considered a more relevant predictor of immediate future commodity market movements 
we rely on var to determine the potential reduction in the trading and price risk management portfolio values arising from changes in market conditions over a defined period 
while management believes that the referenced assumptions and approximations are reasonable  no uniform industry methodology exists for estimating var and different assumptions and approximations could produce materially different var estimates 
our var exposure represents an estimate of potential losses that would be recognized for our trading and price risk management portfolio of derivative financial instruments  physical contracts and gas in storage due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon within a specified confidence level 
a one day time horizon and a percent confidence level were used in our var data 
actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated by the var calculation based on actual fluctuations in commodity prices  operating exposures and timing thereof  and the changes in the company s trading and price risk management portfolio of derivative financial instruments and physical contracts 
var information should be evaluated in light of this information and the methodology s other limitations 

table of contents the potential impact on our future earnings  as measured by the var  was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the following table details the average  high and low var calculations years ended december  value at risk millions of dollars average high low the variations in the var data are reflective of our marketing and trading growth and market volatility during the year 
risk policy and oversight we control the scope of risk management  marketing and trading operations through a comprehensive set of policies and procedures involving senior levels of management 
our board of directors affirms the risk limit parameters with our audit committee having oversight responsibilities for the policies 
a risk oversight committee  comprised of corporate and business segment officers  oversees all activities related to commodity price  credit and interest rate risk management  marketing and trading activities 
the committee also proposes risk metrics including var and position loss limits 
we have a corporate risk control organization lead by the vice president of risk control  who is assigned responsibility for establishing and enforcing the policies  procedures and limits and evaluating the risks inherent in proposed transactions 
key risk control activities include credit review and approval  credit and performance risk measurement and monitoring  validation of transactions  portfolio valuation  var and other risk metrics 
to the extent open commodity positions exist  fluctuating commodity prices can impact our financial results and financial position either favorably or unfavorably 
as a result  we cannot predict with precision the impact risk management decisions may have on the business  operating results or financial position
