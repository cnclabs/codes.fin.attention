item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview we are a leading merchant supplier of secure communications and intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance isr systems  training  simulation and support services  aviation products and aircraft modernization  as well as specialized products 
our customers include the dod and prime contractors thereof  certain us government intelligence agencies  major aerospace and defense contractors  foreign governments  commercial customers and certain other us federal  state and local government agencies 
we have the following four reportable segments secure communications isr  training  simulation support services  aviation products aircraft modernization  and specialized products 
our secure communications isr segment provides products and services for the global isr market as well as secure  high data rate communications systems and equipment primarily for military and other us government reconnaissance and surveillance applications 
we believe our systems and products are critical elements of virtually all major communication  command and control  intelligence gathering and space systems 
our systems and products are used to connect a variety of airborne  space  ground and sea based communication systems and are used in the transmission  processing  recording  monitoring and dissemination functions of these communication systems 
our training  simulation support services segment produces training systems and related support services  and provides a wide range of engineering development and integration support  a full range of teaching  training  logistics and communication software support services  crisis management software and custom ballistic targets 
our aviation products aircraft modernization segment provides our tcas products  cockpit voice  flight data and cruise ship hardened voyage recorders  ruggedized custom displays and specialized aircraft modernization  upgrade and maintenance services 
our specialized products segment provides ocean products  telemetry  instrumentation  space and guidance products  premium fuzing products  security systems  training devices and motion simulators  video security and surveillance and electro optic surveillance systems  ruggedized commercial off the shelf technology and microwave components 
in recent years  domestic and worldwide political and economic developments have significantly affected the markets for defense systems  products and services 
two events in had a dramatic impact on the domestic and international political and economic landscape 
they impacted l and the defense industry generally 
first  the events of september created uncertainty and exposed vulnerabilities in the security and the overall defense of the us homeland 
second  in the conclusions of the us quadrennial defense review qdr completed during there was a fundamental and philosophical shift in focus from a threat based model to one that emphasizes the capabilities needed to defeat a full spectrum of adversaries 
transforming the nation s defense posture to a capabilities based approach involves creating the ability for a more flexible response  with greater force mobility  stronger space capabilities  missile defense  improved and network centric communications and information systems security and an increased emphasis on homeland defense 
the actual fiscal dod budget authority was billion and the dod budget request for fiscal years through indicate a compounded annual growth rate of with billion for fiscal more important are the trends for the investment account which is comprised of the procurement and research  development  test and evaluation rdt e components of the dod budget 
we believe the investment account is a better indicator of the portion of the dod budget that is applicable to defense contractors 
the investment account increased in fiscal year to billion and the dod budget investment account requests for fiscal years to indicate a compounded annual growth rate of with billion in fiscal year additionally  the dod budgets have experienced increased focus on command  control  communications  intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance cisr  precision guided weapons  unmanned aerial vehicles uavs  network centric communications  special operations forces sof and missile defense 
we believe l is well positioned to benefit from increased spending in those areas 
in addition  increased emphasis on homeland defense may increase demand for our capabilities in areas such as security systems  information security  crisis management  preparedness and prevention services  and civilian security operations 
while there is no assurance that the requested dod budget increases will be approved by congress  after over a decade of downward trends  the current outlook is one of continued increased dod spending  which we believe would positively affect our future orders and sales and favorably affect our future operating profits because of increased sale volumes 
all of our domestic government contracts and subcontracts are subject to audit and various cost controls  and include standard provisions for termination for the convenience of the us government 
multiyear us government contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable 
foreign government contracts generally include comparable provisions relating to termination for the convenience of the relevant foreign government 
acquisitions and divestitures the table below summarizes the more significant acquisitions that we have completed during the three years ended december  purchase acquired business date acquired price in millions training devices and training services tdts business of raytheon company february  lnr and emp businesses of trex communications corporation february  traffic alert and collision avoidance systems business of honeywell international inc april  mpri  inc june  coleman research corporation december  kdi precision products may  eer systems may  spar aerospace limited november  emergent government services group november  bt fuze products december  sy technology sy december  aircraft integration systems ais business of raytheon company march   detection systems june  telos corporation a california corporation july  comcept  inc july  technology  management and analysis corporation tma september  electron devices and displays navigation systems san diego businesses of northrop grumman october  wolf coach  inc october  international microwave corporation imc november  westwood corporation november  wescam inc november  ship analytics  inc december  the purchase price represents the contractual consideration for the acquired business excluding adjustments for net cash acquired and acquisition costs 
following the acquisition we changed tdts s name to l communications link simulation and training 
includes million of additional preliminary purchase price yet to be paid that was based on the financial performance of coleman for the year ended december  following the acquisition  we changed emergent government services group s name to l communications analytics 
excludes additional purchase price  not to exceed million  which is contingent upon the financial performance of bt fuze products for the year ending december  excludes additional purchase price  not to exceed million  which is contingent upon the financial performance of sy for the year ended december  and the year ending december  includes million related to additional assets contributed by raytheon company raytheon to ais 
following the acquisition  we changed ais s name to l communications integrated systems is 
the purchase price is subject to adjustment based on actual closing date tangible net assets 
includes a million preliminary purchase price adjustment 
the purchase price is subject to further adjustment based on actual closing date net working capital 
the purchase price is subject to adjustment based on actual closing date net assets or net working capital of the acquired business 
the purchase price consists of million of cash and  shares of l holdings common stock valued at million 
excludes additional purchase price in the form of l holdings common stock  which is contingent upon the financial performance of comcept for the fiscal years ending june  and the maximum additional l holdings common stock payable is  shares 
excludes additional purchase price  not to exceed million  which is contingent upon the financial performance of tma for the twelve months ended september  following the acquisition  we changed its name to l communications tma corporation 
following the acquisition  we changed the name of the displays navigation systems san diego business to l ruggedized command control 
excludes additional purchase price  not to exceed million  which is contingent upon the financial performance of wolf coach for the years ending december   and excludes additional purchase price  not to exceed million  which is contingent upon the financial performance of imc for the year ending december  excludes additional purchase price  not to exceed million  which is contingent upon the financial performance of ship analytics for the years ending december   and additionally  we purchased other businesses during  and  which individually and in the aggregate were not material to our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows in the year acquired 
on january  we agreed to acquire goodrich avionics systems  a division of goodrich corporation  for million in cash 
the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions  including clearance under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvement act 
we expect to complete the acquisition in march all of our acquisitions have been accounted for as purchase business combinations and are included in our consolidated results of operations from their respective effective dates 
on may   we sold a interest in aviation communications and surveillance systems llc acss  which comprises our tcas business  to thales avionics  a wholly owned subsidiary of thales formerly thomson csf  for million of cash 
we continue to consolidate the financial statements of acss 
we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions and joint venture transactions  but we have not entered into any other agreements with respect to any material transactions at this time 
is acquisition 
in march  l completed its largest and most significant acquisition since l s formation in april  with the acquisition of the aircraft integration systems ais business from raytheon for approximately billion in cash 
following the closing of the acquisition we changed the name of ais to l communications integrated systems is 
the is acquisition expanded l s operations in a critical dod priority area that we believe is central to the dod s transformation to network centric warfare  which is a layered communications architecture that enables military platforms from space  air  sea and ground to share information on a real time basis 
both is and comcept  which we acquired in july  are leaders in assisting the dod in charting the future warfighting activities to achieve the persistent intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance isr needed to become a more mobile  responsive and lethal force 
we believe that l is now at the forefront of assisting in the development of seamless integrated command  control  communications and isr cisr 
during the fourth quarter of  l completed its final purchase price allocation of the acquisition date balance sheet for the is acquired assets and assumed liabilities 
this allocation reflects the final appraisals and other valuations of the fair value for the is acquired assets and assumed liabilities  as well as the results from the audit of ais s acquired net assets that was performed by our independent auditors see note to consolidated financial statements 
the adjustments included in the final purchase price allocation increased the intangible assets primarily goodwill that we initially recorded for the is acquisition by million 
this increase to the is intangible assets does not include any adjustment for the final purchase price of ais  which will be based on the difference between ais s final closing date net tangible book value  as defined in the ais asset purchase agreement  and the ais net tangible book value as of september   which we expect to result in a reduction to the ais purchase price 
we have submitted our proposed purchase price adjustment in accordance with the asset purchase agreement to raytheon  the seller of the ais business  which amounts to a reduction of million to the final purchase price submitted by raytheon to l we expect to resolve the final purchase price for ais with raytheon in any amount received by l for a reduction to the ais purchase price will be recorded as a reduction to the is goodwill 
the most significant adjustments to the initial purchase price allocation pertain to revisions of million to update estimated costs to complete the ais acquired contracts as of the date of acquisition to reflect circumstances that existed prior to the date of acquisition  and million of adjustments resulting from the valuation of acquired contracts in process at their estimated contract values  less l s estimated costs to complete the contracts and a reasonable profit allowance on l s completion effort 
the ais acquired contracts in process had aggregate contract values of approximately billion  including funded and unfunded amounts  with approximately billion of funded backlog at the date of acquisition 
the majority of the revisions to estimated costs to complete acquired contracts relate to the sea sentinel contract  with other amounts relating to the extract  peace pioneer  sivam  srp and lc contracts 
the ais acquired contracts in process reflected in l s initial purchase price allocation were based on september contract estimates prepared by ais 
l updated ais s september contract estimates for the five months of activity and changes in circumstances  which occurred before the effective date of the acquisition  march   in order to complete the audit of the ais acquired net assets and prepare the final purchase price allocation 
l was not able to finalize and complete its assessments of the estimated costs to complete the ais contracts until after we acquired ais and obtained full access to the data underlying the contracts enabling us to perform complete bottoms up estimates for all of the ais contracts 
most of the revisions related to foreign contracts for which we do not expect any significant contract renewals after we complete them 
the largest adjustment related to sea sentinel which is a million  firm fixed price contract with the royal australian air force raaf  that was awarded to ais in august the contract provides the raaf with upgraded mission equipment on p c raaf aircraft and the delivery and installation of an operational mission simulator  a systems engineering laboratory and a mission replay and analysis module 
ais experienced design  schedule and cost growth problems on the sea sentinel contract for several years 
as of march   ais had delivered three of the total aircraft required to be delivered under the contract  none of the aircraft had been accepted by the customer and million of the sea sentinel contract value of million had been recognized as revenue 
l believes that it has resolved all of the major performance issues on sea sentinel  and since the acquisition we have delivered four additional aircraft to the customer and seven aircraft have been accepted by the customer 
we expect to deliver the final aircraft to the customer in february we expect to increase the sales and improve the operating margins and cash flows of the is acquired business by implementing cost reduction actions and business processes and controls  which l undertakes for all of its acquisitions 
the cost reduction actions include reducing overhead and administration costs of our acquired businesses  which we accomplish by maintaining disciplined cost controls 
we also have placed new financial management at is and have performed a comprehensive review of all direct and indirect costs for each department of the business to eliminate non value added costs and expenses and staff functions 
we also have implemented l s disciplined contract bid and proposal controls to improve competitive contract award win rates and increase profitability on is s future contract renewals and new business 
as a result of these undertakings  we expect to increase the average profit rate that is earns on the new contracts and contract renewals awarded after the acquisition date  and by the end of the first half of we expect to reduce the annual operating costs and expenses of the is business by more than million 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and costs and expenses during the reporting period 
the most significant of these estimates and assumptions relate to contract estimates of sales and estimated costs to complete contracts in process  estimates of market values for inventories reported at lower of cost or market  estimates of pension and postretirement benefit obligations  recoverability of recorded amounts of fixed assets  identifiable intangible assets and goodwill  income taxes  including the valuations of deferred tax assets  litigation and environmental obligations 
actual amounts will differ from these estimates 
we believe that critical accounting estimates have the following attributes we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies contain the more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
contract revenue recognition and contract estimates 
the substantial majority of our sales to the us government and certain of our sales to foreign governments and commercial customers are made pursuant to written contractual arrangements or contracts to design  develop  manufacture and or modify complex products  to the buyers customer s specifications and to provide services related to the performance of such contracts 
these contracts are within the scope of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop  and cost reimbursable contracts with the us government are also specifically within the scope of accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  section a  government contracts  cost plus fixed fee contracts arb 
certain of our contracts with the us government are multi year contracts that are funded annually by the customer  and sales on these multi year contracts are based on amounts appropriated funded by the us government 
sales and profits on fixed price contracts are recognized using percentage of completion methods of accounting 
sales and profits on fixed price production contracts whose units are produced and delivered in a continuous or sequential process are recorded as units are delivered based on their selling prices the units of delivery method 
sales and profits on other fixed price contracts are recorded based on the ratio of total actual incurred costs to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the contract for each contract the cost to cost method 
under the percentage of completion methods of accounting  a single estimated total profit margin is used to recognize profit for each contract over its entire period of performance which can exceed one year 
accounting for the sales and profit on a fixed price contract requires estimates of the contract value or total contract revenue  the total costs at completion  which is equal to the sum of the actual incurred costs to date on the contract and the estimated costs to complete the contract s scope of work and the measurement of progress towards completion 
the estimated profit or loss on a contract is equal to the difference between the total contract value and the estimated total cost at completion 
under the units of delivery percentage of completion method  sales on a fixed price contract are recorded as the units are delivered during the period at an amount equal to the contractual selling price of those units 
under the cost to cost percentage of completion method  sales on a fixed price contract are recorded at amounts equal to the ratio of cumulative costs incurred to date to total estimated costs at completion multiplied by the contract value  less the cumulative sales recognized in prior periods 
the profit recorded on a contract in any period under both the units of delivery method and cost to cost method is equal to the current estimated total profit margin for the contract stated as a percentage of contract revenue multiplied by the cumulative sales recorded less the cumulative profit previously recorded 
adjustments to original estimates for a contract s revenues  estimated costs at completion and estimated total profit are often required as work progresses under a contract  as experience is gained and as more information is obtained  even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change  or if contract modifications occur 
these changes are recorded on a cumulative catch up basis in the period they are determined to be necessary 
sales and profits on a cost reimbursable contract are recognized as allowable costs are incurred on the contract and become billable to the customer  in an amount equal to the allowable costs plus the profit on those cost which is generally fixed or variable based on the contract fee arrangement 
thus  cost reimbursable contracts are generally not subject to the same estimation risks that affect fixed price contracts 
the impact of revisions in profit estimates on both fixed price and cost reimbursable contracts are recognized on a cumulative catch up basis in the period in which the revisions are made 
provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are recorded in the period in which they become evident 
amounts representing contract change orders or claims are included in sales only when they can be reliably estimated and their realization is reasonably assured 
the revisions in contract estimates  if significant  can materially affect our results of operations and cash flows  as well as our valuations of contracts in process 
for the year ended december  sales on fixed price contracts recognized using the units of delivery percentage of completion method accounted for approximately of total sales  sales on fixed price contracts recognized using the cost to cost percentage of completion method accounted for approximately of total sales  and sales on cost reimbursable contracts  which are recognized as costs are incurred  accounted for approximately of total sales 
the remaining of sales for the year ended december  pertain to fixed price sales arrangements principally with commercial customers  which were not within the scope of sop or arb and were recorded as products are delivered and services are performed 
goodwill and intangible assets 
l reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  and also reviews goodwill annually in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  l recorded identifiable intangible assets  such as customer relationships  that are acquired in connection with a business acquisition 
the value assigned to identifiable intangible assets are determined based on estimates and judgements regarding expectations for future contract renewals and their related cash flows and the life cycle of acquired products and their related cash flows 
if actual future contract renewals  differ significantly from the estimates  we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the identifiable intangible asset to its realizable value 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested annually using a two step process 
the first step is to identify any potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value 
if a potential impairment is identified  the second step is to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the impairment loss 
the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow valuation approach  and is dependent on estimates for future sales  operating income  depreciation and amortization  income tax payments  working capital changes  and capital expenditures  as well as  expected growth rates for cash flows and long term interest rates  all of which are impacted by economic conditions related to the industries in which we operate as well as conditions in the us capital markets 
a decline in estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in an unexpected impairment charge to goodwill  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
pension plan and postretirement benefit plan obligations 
the obligations for our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans and the related annual costs of employee benefits are calculated based on several long term assumptions  including discount rates  rates of return on plan assets  expected annual rates for salary increases for employee participants in the case of pension plans  and expected annual increases in the costs of medical and other health care benefits in the case of postretirement benefit obligations 
these long term assumptions are subject to revision based on changes in interest rates  financial market conditions  expected versus actual returns on plan assets  participant mortality rates and other actuarial assumptions  future rates of salary increases  benefit formulas and levels  and rates of increase in the costs of benefits 
such changes  if significant  can materially affect the amount of annual net periodic benefit costs recognized in results of operations  our liabilities for the pension plans and postretirement benefit plans  and our annual cash requirements to fund these plans 
valuation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million  including million for net operating loss carryforwards and million for tax credit carryforwards which are subject to various limitations and will expire if unused within their respective carryforward periods 
deferred income taxes are determined separately for each of our tax paying entities in each tax jurisdiction 
the future realization of our deferred income tax assets ultimately depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character for example  ordinary income or capital gain within the carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law  and to a lesser extent  our ability to execute successful tax planning strategies 
based on our estimates of the amounts and timing of future taxable income and tax planning strategies  we believe that we will realize our recorded deferred tax assets 
a change in the ability of our operations to continue to generate future taxable income  or our ability to implement desired tax planning strategies  could affect our ability to realize the future tax deductions underlying our net deferred tax assets  and require us to provide a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
such changes  if significant  could have a material impact in our effective tax rate  results of operations and financial position in any given period 
results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements 
our results of operations for the periods presented are impacted significantly by our acquisitions see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our acquisitions  including pro forma sales  net income and diluted earnings per share data for the years ended december  and we present our sales and cost and expenses in two categories on the statement of operations  contracts  primarily us government and commercial  primarily products  which are based on how we recognize revenue 
sales and costs and expenses for l s businesses that are primarily us government contractors are presented as contracts  primarily us government 
the sales for l s us government contractor businesses are transacted using written contractual arrangements or contracts for products and services according to the specifications of the customer and are within the scope of sop and arb sales reported under contracts  primarily us government also include certain sales by l s us government contractor businesses transacted using contracts for domestic and foreign commercial customers which also are within the scope of sop sales and costs and expenses for l s businesses whose customers are primarily commercial customers are presented as commercial  primarily products 
these sales to commercial customers are not within the scope of sop or arb  and are recognized in accordance with sec sab no 
l s commercial businesses are substantially comprised of aviation communication surveillance systems acss  aviation recorders  microwave components  detection systems business acquired from perkin elmer  inc  satellite networks  and primewave communications

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  consolidated sales increased  million to  million for from  million for for  sales grew million  or  excluding the increase in sales from acquired businesses of  million discussed below 
had these acquisitions occurred on january   pro forma sales for would have been  million  an increase of over pro forma sales of  million for see note to the consolidated financial statements 
sales from contracts  primarily us government increased  million to  million for from  million for the analytics  bt fuze  comcept  eer  electron devices  is  kdi  ruggedized command control  ship analytics  spar  sy  telos  tma  wescam and westwood acquired businesses contributed  million of the increase in sales 
excluding these acquisitions  sales grew million  or  in volume increased million for explosive detection systems  million for secure communication systems  million for training services and devices  million for navigation and guidance products and million for military displays products 
these sales increases were partially offset by declines of million on naval power equipment and million on static transfer switches used for commercial applications 
sales of ballistic missile targets and services declined million 
the remaining decline in sales of million was primarily related to acoustic undersea warfare products because of lower volume on spares 
sales from commercial  primarily products increased million to million for from million for the detection systems  imc and wolf coach acquired businesses contributed million of the increase in sales 
excluding these acquisitions  sales declined million or 
this decrease in sales was due to volume declines of million on commercial aviation products  million on microwave components and million on primewave communication products 
these declines were partially offset by increases of million for maritime voyage recorders and million primarily for technical and product support services for commercial customers 
commercial  primarily products sales declined to of total sales for from for the decline was primarily attributable to the acquisitions we completed during  including the is acquisition  and to a lesser extent  the decline in our commercial sales 
this decline was attributable to the continued weakness in the commercial aviation and communications markets 
our acquisitions were comprised substantially of dod contractors 
even if a rebound occurs in the commercial aviation and communications markets  which we are not anticipating for  we expect our commercial sales as a percentage of total sales to remain at the current level 
furthermore  even considering our stated interest in expanding l s business in avionics for both military and commercial applications through select niche acquisitions  we do not expect to make any substantial acquisitions of commercial businesses 
consolidated costs and expenses increased  million to  million for from  million for  primarily as a result of the increase in sales 
in accordance with sfas no 
 on january  we stopped amortizing our goodwill to expenses 
goodwill amortization expense was million for sfas no 
also requires that we evaluate the fair value of our goodwill annually to determine if it has been impaired 
we evaluated the carrying value of our goodwill as of january  in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas no 
and wrote off million of goodwill related to certain of our space and broadband commercial communications businesses  which has been reported as a million loss after income taxes for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  as discussed below 
if we experience any impairments to the carrying value of our goodwill after january   we will have to report them as a loss from operations 
during  we did not have any other goodwill impairments 
we expect to perform our annual impairment test during the first quarter of costs and expenses for contracts  primarily us government increased  million to  million for from  million for approximately of the increase is attributable to our acquired businesses 
the remaining increase is primarily attributed to internal growth for explosive detection systems and secure communication systems 
goodwill amortization expense was million for costs and expenses for sales on our direct and indirect contracts with the us government include selling  general and administrative sg a costs  including independent research and development and bid and proposal costs  because sg a costs are allowable indirect contract costs that we allocate to our us government contracts in accordance with us government regulations 
accordingly  we do not report sg a costs on us government contracts as period expenses 
sg a costs allocated to our us government contracts were million for and million for see note to our consolidated financial statements 
costs and expenses for commercial  primarily products increased million to million for from million for the increase is primarily due to increased sales as a result of the detection systems acquired business  which was partially offset by lower expenses for microwave components products due to lower sales volume 
goodwill amortization expense was million for sg a expenses  including research and development r d expenses  increased million to million for from million for  primarily because of sg a expenses incurred by our acquired businesses 
consolidated operating income increased by million to million for from for the increase was due to higher sales for all of our segments 
the impact of not amortizing goodwill increased consolidated operating income by million 
consolidated operating income as a percentage of sales operating margin declined by percentage points to for from for the impact of not amortizing goodwill increased consolidated operating margin by percentage points 
operating margins compared to operating margins for  excluding goodwill amortization expense  declined for our training  simulation support services  aviation products aircraft modernization and specialized products segments  and increased for our secure communications isr segment 
the changes in the operating margins for our segments are discussed below 
operating income for contracts  primarily u 
s government increased million to million for from million for operating margin increased percentage points to for  from for the impact of not amortizing goodwill increased operating margin by percentage points 
operating income for includes a loss of million for the settlement in june of certain litigations that we assumed in connection with a business we acquired in  which reduced operating margin for by percentage points 
the remaining decline in operating margin was due to the absence in of a favorable performance adjustment recorded in on the avcatt contract 
operating income included approximately million of losses in both and related to our naval power equipment business that were caused by production problems which reduced sales volume and related costs to fix manufacturing and quality control problems 
we expect to reduce the losses in our naval power equipment business to about million for because of higher sales related to increasing production levels 
operating income for commercial  primarily products declined million to million for from million for operating margin declined percentage points to for from for the decline was principally attributable to lower gross margin contributions from commercial aviation products  microwave components  and space and broadband communication products because of volume declines  as well as continued marketing  selling and development expenses for the primewave business 
the impact of not amortizing goodwill partially offset these decreases in operating margin by percentage points 
we expect to reduce our losses from the primewave communications business by approximately million in because of higher expected sales volume and lower r d and sg a expenses for the business 
interest expense increased million to million for from million for the increase is attributable to higher outstanding debt for primarily related to the financing of the is acquisition  which was partially offset by lower interest rates on our debt 
our interest rate swap agreements which converted the fixed interest rates on million of our senior subordinated notes to variable interest rates reduced our interest expense for by million because of declining interest rates that the interest rate swaps enabled us to enjoy 
in june  we also redeemed our million senior subordinated notes and replaced them with senior subordinated notes that have a fixed interest rate which reduced our interest expense by million 
see liquidity and capital resources financing activities below 
interest and other income increased million to million for from million for  principally due to interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
additionally  included a net gain of million comprising a gain on the sale of a interest in the acss business  largely offset by the write down of the carrying value of an investment in the common stock of a telecommunications company  because the decline in value for that common stock was determined to be other than temporary 
the income tax provision for is based on an effective income tax rate of  compared with an effective income tax rate of for the year ended december  the decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to the adoption of sfas no 
amortization expense for goodwill that is not deductible for income tax purposes caused an increase in our effective income tax rate prior to the adoption of sfas no 
basic earnings per share eps before extraordinary item and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle increased to for from for diluted eps before extraordinary item and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle increased to for from for the impact of not amortizing goodwill in increased basic eps before extraordinary item and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle by and diluted eps before extraordinary item and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle by 
excluding the increase in earnings attributable to not amortizing goodwill  basic eps before extraordinary item and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle grew and diluted eps before extraordinary item and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle grew 
basic eps was and diluted eps was after an extraordinary loss of million per basic and diluted share on the early extinguishment of debt arising from the retirement of our million of senior subordinated notes and a loss of million per basic share and per diluted share for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for a goodwill impairment  recorded effective as of january  in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
diluted weighted average common shares outstanding increased to million for from million for the increase principally reflects the additional shares outstanding from the sale of million shares of our common stock effective may   and the sale of million shares of our common stock effective june  the diluted eps computation for did not include the dilutive effect of the million shares of l holdings common stock that are issuable upon conversion of the codes see notes and to the consolidated financial statements because the conditions for their conversion were not satisfied 
however  if the codes had been convertible  reported diluted eps would have decreased by approximately for secure communications isr sales for the secure communications isr segment increased million to million for from million for the is tactical reconnaissance systems including airborne surveillance control trs and comcept acquired businesses contributed million of sales 
excluding these acquisitions  sales grew million or 
volumes on secure communication systems  including secure terminal equipment ste  secure data links and military communications products increased million because of greater demand for secure communications from the dod and us government intelligence agencies 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales of million primarily due to lower volumes of primewave communication products 
we expect that the demand for our secure communications systems and isr products will remain strong for  enabling the segment to generate sales growth in  excluding acquisitions in excess of 
operating income increased by million to million for from million for because of higher sales and operating margin 
operating margin improved by percentage points to for compared to for the impact of not amortizing goodwill increased operating margin by percentage points 
increased volume and cost improvements on secure communication systems increased margins by percentage points 
higher losses for the primewave business in due to lower sales  higher marketing  selling and development expenses and a provision to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts by million lowered operating margin by percentage points 
the remaining change in operating margins was principally attributable to margins from the is trs acquired business  which was higher than the segment operating margin for training  simulation support services sales for the training  simulation support services segment increased million to million for from million for the analytics  eer  ship analytics  sy technologies  telos and tma acquired businesses contributed million of the increase in sales 
excluding these acquisitions  sales declined million or 
sales for ballistic missile targets and services at our coleman research business declined million primarily because of a contract completed in and the delay in the award of its follow on contract  which is related to the us missile defense agency s decision to consolidate the target requirements for all of its major missile defense programs into a single contract for fiscal year the decline in ballistic missile targets and services was largely offset by volume increases for training services from new contracts with the dod  contracts competitively awarded during and software and systems engineering services 
we expect that the sales growth  excluding acquisitions  for our training  simulation and support services will be between and in  which is consistent with the overall increase in the dod budget 
we also expect our sales of ballistic missile targets and services to increase in operating income increased by million to million for from million for because of higher sales and operating margin 
operating margin increased by percentage points to for compared to for principally because of the impact of not amortizing goodwill 
aviation products aircraft modernization sales for the aviation products aircraft modernization segment increased million to million for from million for the is aircraft modification and maintenance amm and spar acquired businesses contributed million to sales 
excluding acquisitions  sales declined million  or  because of lower volumes for commercial aviation recorders and tcas products that were partially offset by sales increases for military displays products and commercial maritime voyage recorders 
the decline in commercial aviation products sales was caused by a decline in orders and customer directed deferrals of deliveries stemming from the continued downturn in the commercial aircraft industry that began in and which remained weak during although we expect the commercial aviation markets to remain weak during  we do not expect our sales of commercial products to decline in because of the introduction of our new tcas product  which we plan to begin shipping by the end of the first half of  and higher volume for our maritime voyage recorders and transponders 
we expect sales from our aircraft modification services  which are primarily performed for the dod  to increase slightly during operating income increased by million to million for from million for  because of higher sales from acquired businesses 
operating margin declined by percentage points to for from for the impact of not amortizing goodwill increased operating margin by percentage points 
lower volumes on tcas and aviation recorders  increased development expenses for a terrain awareness warning system and a commercial displays product line reduced operating margin by percentage points 
the remaining decrease in operating margin of percentage points was principally attributable to margins from the is amm and spar acquired businesses  which averaged and were lower than the segment operating margin for margins for our aircraft modification businesses are lower than the margins for our commercial aviation products businesses  and the aircraft modification businesses generated of the segment s sales for compared with only for  which reduced the overall margin for the entire segment as we expected 
specialized products sales for the specialized products segment increased million to  million for from  million for the bt fuze  detection systems  electron devices  imc  kdi  ruggedized command control  wescam  westwood and wolf coach acquired businesses contributed million of sales 
excluding these acquisitions  sales increased million or 
sales of explosive detection systems used in airport security principally relating to a contract from the transportation security administration contributed million of the increase in sales 
navigation and guidance products sales also increased by million 
these increases to sales were partially offset by volume declines of million on naval power equipment arising from lower shipments caused by production capacity diverted to fixing quality control problems  million on training devices because certain contracts were completed in  million for acoustic undersea warfare products primarily arising from lower spares volume  and million for commercial static transfer switches because of the deterioration of the internet service provider market 
the remaining decline of million was principally on microwave components and telemetry and space products arising from continued softness and declining demand in the space  broadband and wireless commercial communications markets 
we expect that our sales for eds in will decline to about million primarily because the initial build out of eds by tsa for major us airports was completed in excluding the decline in eds in  we expect the sales growth  excluding acquisitions  for our specialized products to be between and 
the majority of the growth is expected for naval power equipment for which shipments should increase after fixing the production problems experienced during and and for navigation products and training devices because of continued strong demand and recent orders 
operating income increased by million to million for from million for because of higher sales and operating margin 
operating margin improved by percentage points to for compared to for the impact of not amortizing goodwill increased operating margin by percentage points 
higher volumes for explosive detection systems caused an increase in operating margin of percentage points 
these increases were partially offset by declines in operating margin that was primarily related to lower volumes on naval power equipment  microwave components and training devices  and the absence in of a favorable performance adjustment recorded in on the avcatt contract discussed below 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  consolidated sales increased million to  million for compared with sales from contracts  primarily us government increased million to  million for from  million for the mpri  coleman  kdi and eer acquisitions contributed million of the sales increase in the remaining sales increase in was primarily attributable to volume increases of million on secure telephone equipment and secure data links  million on training devices and services  million on acoustic undersea warfare products and million on airport security systems 
these sales increases were partially offset by declines of million on naval power equipment due to lower shipments caused by production quality control problems and customer directed reductions in delivery requirements  and volume declines of million primarily on telemetry and space products related to the continued decline in the telemetry  space and broadband markets 
sales from commercial  primarily products increased million to million in from million in the increase in was primarily attributable to volume increases of million on aviation products  million in microwave components and million from fixed wireless access products 
the remaining change in sales was due to an increase in network support services  which was partially offset by declines primarily on telemetry and space products related to the continued decline in the commercial telemetry  space and broadband communications markets 
the total increase in costs and expenses of million to  million for from  million for is consistent with the increases in sales

operating income increased because of higher sales by million to million for compared with operating income as a percentage of sales operating margin remained unchanged at 
operating margins improved at our training  simulation support services segment  our aviation products aircraft modernization segment and our specialized products segment 
these margin improvements were offset by a margin decline at our secure communications isr segment 
the change in operating margin for each of our segments is discussed below 
interest expense decreased million to million for because of lower interest rates  changes in the components and levels of our debt  and savings of million from the interest rate swap agreements we entered into in july and november the interest rate swap agreements exchange the fixed interest rate of on our million senior subordinated notes due and the fixed interest rate of on our million senior subordinated notes due to variable interest rates determined using the six month libor rate

excluding these net gains from both and  diluted eps increased to in from in the income tax provision for is based on an effective income tax rate of which declined slightly from the effective tax rate of for basic earnings per share eps grew to for and diluted eps grew to for diluted weighted average common shares outstanding increased for  primarily because of the sale of our common stock in may  and the dilutive effect of our convertible notes we sold in the fourth quarter of see liquidity and capital resources 
secure communications isr sales within our secure communications isr segment increased million  or  to million for compared with the increase in sales was attributed to increased sales of million from secure telephone equipment due to an increase in demand for secure communications  and million from primewave fixed wireless access products related to a contract for a customer in argentina 
the remaining net decrease in sales was principally attributable to a decline in communication subsystems for the international space station  which was partially offset by higher volume for secure data links 
operating income decreased by million to million for from million for because of lower operating margins that were partially offset by higher operating income from higher sales 
operating margin declined percentage points from in to in negative contract margins and increased sg a and development expenditures and bad debt provisions associated with our primewave business reduced operating margin by percentage points 
volume declines and cost overruns related to design and manufacturing problems on certain signal collection and processing equipment reduced operating margin by percentage points 
the remaining decline in operating margin was principally attributable to lower volumes on certain military communication systems programs caused by contract deliveries that were completed or approaching completion in the declines were partially offset by higher operating margins on secure telephone equipment attributable to increased volumes and cost improvements 
training  simulation support services sales within our training  simulation support services segment increased million  or  to million for compared with the coleman  mpri  and eer acquisitions contributed million of the increase in sales 
the remaining increase in sales was attributable to various training  simulation and communications software support services 
operating income increased by million to million for because of higher sales and operating margins 
operating margin increased percentage points from in to for volume increases and cost improvements from the link training services business increased operating margin by percentage points 
the remaining increase was principally attributable to higher margins from acquired businesses 
aviation products aircraft modernization sales within our aviation products aircraft modernization segment increased million  or  to million for compared with volume increased million on tcas products and was attributable to increased customer demand and the timing of the tcas acquisition completed in april volume also increased by million for aviation recorders because of commercial customer retrofit deliveries 
the remaining increase was primarily attributable to the spar aerospace business acquired in november offset by volume declines of million for displays sold to military customers related to the timing of contractual shipments 
operating income increased by million to million for from million for primarily because of higher sales 
operating margin increased percentage points from for to for operating margin increased by percentage points because of higher volume of tcas products with higher gross margin contributions 
lower margins on display products related to volume declines reduced operating margin by percentage points 
lower margins from the spar aerospace acquired business  which we expected  caused the remaining change in the operating margin 
specialized products sales within our specialized products segment increased million  or  to  million for compared with the increase in sales was principally attributable to the kdi acquired business and increases in volume for microwave components and acoustic undersea warfare products  partially offset by decreases in sales of telemetry and space products and naval power equipment 
operating income increased by million for to million because of higher operating margin 
operating margin increased percentage points to for from for reductions in contract costs related to favorable performance on the avcatt contract  arising from engineering design changes  material sourcing changes and unit price reductions on several parts in the contract bill of materials that occurred during increased operating margin by percentage points 
cost improvements from increased volume and product sales mix on microwave components resulted in an increase of percentage points 
higher margins from fuzing products resulted in an increase of percentage points 
the remaining increase in operating margin was primarily attributable to overhead cost reductions and other cost improvements for training devices  volume increases for explosives detection systems and reduced losses on voice and data communication products 
these improvements in operating margin were partially offset by continued unfavorable performance on certain contracts and lower production levels for naval power equipment which caused a decrease of percentage points in operating margin 
pension plans we maintain defined benefit pension plans covering employees at certain of our businesses 
at december   our balance sheet included an aggregate million liability for pension benefits  an increase of million from million at december  the increase was primarily caused by the million of pension liabilities that we assumed as part of the is acquisition and the increase in the minimum liability of million 
our total estimated projected benefit obligation  including projected future salary increases for covered employees was million at the end of  and exceeded the fair value of our pension plan assets of million by million 
the difference between this amount and the pension liability recorded on our balance sheet of million is attributable to the deferred recognition of actuarial gains and losses and accumulated differences between the assumed and actual rates of return on plan assets which increased by million to million from million 
during  our pension plan assets experienced a loss of million  primarily due to the declines in equity capital markets while the expected rate of return on plan assets which was included in the determination of pension cost was million  a difference of million 
in addition  million of the increase in our benefit obligation resulted from changes in the actuarial assumptions and differences between actuarial assumptions and actual results 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions  unrecognized losses that our pension plans experienced in were not included in pension expense for instead  they will be amortized to pension expense in future years over the estimated average remaining service periods of the covered employees see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
our pension expense for was million 
we expect pension expense for to increase by a non cash amount of between million and million over our pension expense  primarily because of the amortization of unrecognized losses through december   and the reductions that we made in to our discount rate from to and rate of return on plan assets from to 
we made pension plan contributions for the full year of million  which exceeded our original planned contributions for by more than million 
we expect to make pension plan contributions of between million and million in a substantial portion of our pension plan contributions for l s businesses that are us government contractors are recoverable as allowable indirect contract costs at amounts generally equal to the annual pension contributions 
our actual pension expense for will be based upon a number of other factors  including the effect of any additional acquisitions for which we assume liabilities for pension benefits  actual pension plan contributions and changes if any to our pension assumptions for  including the discount rate  asset return rate and salary increases 
our shareholders equity at december   reflects a non cash charge of million net of tax to record the increase for the year ended december  in the minimum pension liability in accordance with sfas no 
this non cash charge had no effect on our compliance with the financial covenants of our debt agreements and did not impact our results of operations for liquidity and capital resources balance sheet contracts in process increased million to  million at december  from million at december  the increase included million related to acquired businesses and million principally from o increases of million in billed receivables due to higher sales for aircraft modifications  explosive detection systems  secure communications equipment and isr systems  o increases of million in unbilled contract receivables  net of unliquidated progress payments  due to higher sales from explosive detection systems  isr systems  secure data links  training devices and fuzing products  partially offset by shipments of ocean products and display systems as well as higher billings of aircraft modifications and training and support services  o decreases of million in inventoried contract costs due to liquidations of aircraft modifications and secure terminal equipment inventories  partially offset by increases for naval power equipment  secure data links  ocean products and fuzing products  and o decreases of million in inventories recorded at lower of cost or market due to declines for primewave and security systems that were partially offset by increases for aviation products 
l s days sales outstanding dso was at december  compared with at december  we calculate our dso by dividing a our aggregate end of period billed receivables and net unbilled contract receivables  by b our sales for the last twelve month period adjusted on a pro forma basis for the acquisitions that we completed as of the end of the period  divided by our dso increased to for the twelve month period ended march  primarily  because of the is business  which we acquired on march   and remained relatively constant at for june  and for september  l s dso declined substantially in the fourth quarter of because of higher sales volume and the final purchase price allocation adjustments for the is acquisition 
excluding the is acquisition  l s dso would have been at december  included in contracts in process at december  are net billed receivables of million and net inventories of million for our primewave business 
at december   we had million of net billed receivables and million of net inventories related to our primewave business 
the increase in property  plant and equipment pp e during was principally related to the acquisition of is 
the percentage of depreciation expense to average gross pp e declined to for from for the decline was attributable to the impact from current acquisitions  for which the balance sheet reflects all of the pp e of the acquired businesses  but the statement of operations only includes depreciation expense from the date of acquisition rather than for the entire period  and fully depreciated pp e used in certain of our operations despite having net carrying amounts of zero after accumulated depreciation and which are not removed from the balance sheet until they are retired or otherwise disposed 
goodwill increased  million to  million at december  from  million at december  the increase was principally due to acquisitions with the largest increase for the is acquired business 
the increases in accrued employment costs and accrued interest were primarily due to the timing of payments  as well as our acquisitions completed in the increases in accounts payable  accrued expenses  other current liabilities and pension and postretirement liabilities were primarily due to our acquisitions completed in the increase in other current liabilities was partially offset by the payment in january of million for the remaining outstanding common stock of spar that was not tendered to l as of december  the increase in postretirement liabilities was also attributable to an increase of million of our additional minimum pension liability  as discussed above 
the increase in other liabilities was primarily due to notes payables assumed in connection with our acquisitions completed in  and the deferred gain portion of cash proceeds received upon termination of the interest rate swap transactions we entered in and  as discussed below 
statement of cash flows our cash position at december  was million  million at december  and million at december  the table below provides a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated 
years ended december  in millions net cash from operating activities net cash used in investing activities  net cash from financing activities  net increase decrease in cash operating activities we generated million of cash from our operating activities during  an increase of million from the million generated during earnings adjusted for non cash expenses for and deferred income taxes increased million to million in from million in deferred income taxes for compared with increased primarily because of larger estimated tax deductions arising from our recently completed acquisitions  including our acquisition of is 
other non cash items consist primarily of contributions of common stock to savings plans 
during  our working capital and operating assets and liabilities increased million  compared with an increase of million in our cash flows from operating activities during reflect increases in billed and unbilled receivables  other current assets and other assets 
the use of cash related to customer advances was due to liquidations on certain foreign contracts 
the use of cash for other current liabilities was to fund contracts in a loss position for which estimated costs exceed the estimated billings  and was partially offset by an increase in accrued warranty costs primarily for explosive detection systems delivered in the timing of payments to employees for salaries and wages  as well as the timing of interest payments  was a source of cash 
the source of cash in other liabilities was primarily due to deferred gains on the termination of our swap agreements  discussed below 
pension plan contributions in amounted to million 
during  we generated million of cash from our operating activities  an increase of million from the million generated during earnings adjusted for non cash items and deferred income taxes increased million to million in from million in during  our working capital and operating assets and liabilities increased million compared with an increase of million in in  we used cash for increases in inventories  receivables and negative operating margins related to our primewave business and naval power equipment products  as well as for incurred contract costs in excess of billings for the continued effort on the avcatt contract 
these uses of cash were partially offset by a settlement of certain items related to a services agreement and lower income tax payments 
our cash from operating activities includes interest payments on debt of million for  million for  and million for our interest expense also includes amortization of deferred debt issue costs which is a non cash expense 
our cash from operating activities includes income tax payments  net of refunds of million for  million for  and million for our income tax payments were substantially less than our provisions for income taxes reported on our statements of operations primarily because income tax benefits arising from our acquisitions  as well as reductions to current income taxes payable for compensation expense tax deductions arising from the exercise of employee stock options which are credited directly to shareholders equity and excluded from income see note to our consolidated financial statements 
specifically  the difference of million between our income tax payments during and our provision for income taxes for the year ended december  is comprised of deferred income tax provisions of million  million of employee stock options compensation expense tax deductions and an increase of million to our accrued income taxes  net of certain reclassifications of deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
l receives substantial income tax deductions from its acquisitions of businesses that are structured as asset purchases for income tax purposes 
the effect of these income tax deductions is that our cash payments for income taxes are less than our provision for income taxes reported on the statement of operations 
the difference is presented as deferred income tax provisions on our statement of cash flows 
the deferred income tax provisions primarily result from deducting goodwill amortization from the asset acquisitions on l s income tax returns over years  in accordance with tax rules and regulations  while no amortization is recorded for financial reporting purposes  in accordance with sfas no 
one of the impacts of sfas no 
was an increase to these income tax benefits because prior to adopting the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill was also amortized for financial reporting purposes  although over longer periods of generally years 
we expect that the acquisitions l has completed through december   excluding any additional acquisitions  will continue to generate deferred tax benefits  from to  with amounts for to approximating l s deferred tax benefits for while these income tax deductions are reported as increases or decreases to deferred income tax liabilities and assets  they are not differences that are scheduled to reverse in future periods through normal operations 
rather  they will only reverse if l sells its acquired businesses 
presently  l has no plans to make any material dispositions of its acquired businesses 
investing activities during  we invested  million to acquire businesses  including is  detection systems  telos  comcept  tma  electron devices  ruggedized command control  wolf coach  imc  westwood  wescam and ship analytics  and million for the remaining outstanding common stock of spar which was not tendered to l at december  the cash invested in acquisitions for also includes acquisition costs and payments for contingent purchase price and closing date net assets or net working capital purchase price adjustments for certain acquisitions completed prior to during  we invested million to acquire businesses 
during  we invested to acquire businesses 
the is acquisition was financed using approximately million of cash on hand  borrowings under our senior credit facilities of million and a million senior subordinated bridge loan 
we used a portion of the proceeds from the sale in june of million of senior subordinated notes and million shares of common stock to repay borrowings under the senior credit facilities and the senior subordinated bridge loan as discussed below in financing activities 
all of the other acquisitions were financed using cash on hand 
on may   we sold a interest in acss to thales avionics for million in cash 
in  we sold our interests in two businesses for net cash proceeds of million 
the cash proceeds from these transactions are included in other investing activities 
we make capital expenditures for the improvement of manufacturing facilities and equipment 
we expect that our capital expenditures for the year ending december  will be between million and million 
financing activities debt at december   the senior credit facilities were comprised of a million five year revolving credit facility maturing on may  and a million day revolving facility maturing on february  under which at the maturity date we may  at our request and subject to approval of the lenders  extend the maturity date  in whole or in part  for an additional day period or at our election  convert the outstanding principal amount thereunder into a term loan which would be repayable in a single payment two years from the conversion date 
on february   the company s lenders approved an extension of the maturity date of the day revolving facility to february  at december   available borrowings under our senior credit facilities were million  after reductions for outstanding letters of credit of million 
there were no outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facilities at december  in june  l communications sold million of senior subordinated notes due june  the june notes with interest payable semi annually on june and december of each year commencing december  the net proceeds from that offering amounted to million after underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses 
the net proceeds from the june notes and the simultaneous sale of million shares of our common stock  discussed below under equity  were used to repay million borrowed on march   under our senior subordinated bridge loan facility  repay the indebtedness outstanding under our senior credit facilities  repurchase and redeem the senior subordinated notes due discussed in the following paragraph and increase cash and cash equivalents 
on june  we commenced a tender offer to purchase any and all of our million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the tender offer expired on july  on june  we sent a notice of redemption for all of our senior subordinated notes due that remained outstanding after the expiration of the tender offer 
upon sending the notice  the remaining notes became due and payable at the redemption price as of july  during  we recorded a pre tax extraordinary loss of million million after tax  comprised of premiums  fees and other transaction costs of million and million to write off the remaining balance of unamortized debt issue costs relating to these notes 
in the fourth quarter of  l holdings sold million of senior subordinated convertible contingent debt securities due codes 
the net proceeds from this offering amounted to approximately million after underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses 
interest is payable semi annually on march and september of each year commencing march  the codes are convertible into l holdings common stock at a conversion price of per share  shares under any of the following circumstances during any conversion period defined below if the closing sales price of the common stock of l holdings is more than of the conversion price for at least trading days in the consecutive trading day period ending on the first day of the respective conversion period  during the five business day period following any consecutive trading day period in which the average of the trading prices for the codes was less than of the conversion value  if the credit ratings assigned to the codes by either moody s or standard poor s are below certain specified ratings  if they have been called for redemption by us  or upon the occurrence of certain specified corporate transactions 
a conversion period is the period from and including the thirtieth trading day in a fiscal quarter to  but not including  the thirtieth trading day of the immediately following fiscal quarter 
there are four conversion periods in each fiscal year 
additionally  holders of the codes have a right to receive contingent interest payments  not to exceed a per annum rate of of the outstanding principal amount of the codes  which will be paid on the codes during any six month period following a six month period in which the average trading price of the codes is above of the principal amount of the codes 
the contingent interest payment provision was triggered for the period beginning september  to march  and resulted in additional interest for that period of million 
the contingent interest payment provision as well as the ability of the holders of the codes to exercise the conversion features as a result of changes in the credit ratings assigned to the codes have been accounted for as embedded derivatives 
in the fourth quarter of  l holdings sold million of convertible senior subordinated notes due the convertible notes 
the net proceeds from this offering amounted to million after underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses  and were used to repay revolver borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facilities 
the convertible notes may be converted at any time into l holdings common stock at a conversion price of per share  shares 
in june and august of  we terminated the interest rate swap agreements we entered into in on million of our senior subordinated notes due and received cash proceeds of million 
in connection with the termination  we recorded a reduction in interest expense for of million  which represented the interest savings for the period prior to the termination of the swap agreements earned from the differences between the average variable interest rates of that we paid under the swap agreements which were lower than the average fixed interest rate of on the notes subject to the swaps 
the remaining million represented the future value of the swap agreements at the termination date and was recorded as a deferred gain in accordance with sfas no 
and will be amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining terms of the million of senior subordinated notes due at an amount equal to million per quarter  or million annually 
we recorded an additional reduction of interest expense for of million relating to interest savings for interest periods which ended prior to the period during which we terminated of the interest rate swap agreements 
in june  we entered into interest rate swap agreements on million of our senior subordinated notes due these swap agreements exchanged the fixed interest rate for a variable interest rate on million of the million principal amount outstanding 
on september   we terminated these interest rate swap agreements and received cash proceeds of million in october in connection with the termination  we recorded a reduction of interest expense for of million  which represented interest savings based on the variable interest rate of that l paid in accordance with the terms of the swap for the period prior to the termination of these swap agreements 
the remaining million represented the future value of the swap agreements at the termination date and was recorded as a deferred gain and will be amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the senior subordinated notes due at an amount of million per quarter  or million annually 
all of the cash proceeds received from the swap agreements are included in cash from operating activities on l s statement of cash flows 
l s earnings plan for included anticipated interest expense savings from the swap agreements because we expected the variable rates payable on the swaps would be lower than the fixed interest rates on our senior subordinated notes 
l may enter into new interest rate swap agreements in the future if we believe that financial market conditions are favorable 
the senior credit facilities  senior subordinated notes  convertible notes and codes agreements contain financial covenants and other restrictive covenants which remain in effect so long as we owe any amount or any commitment to lend exists thereunder 
we are in compliance with those covenants in all material respects 
the borrowings under the senior credit facilities are guaranteed by l holdings and by substantially all of the material domestic subsidiaries of l communications on a senior basis 
the payments of principal and premium  if any  and interest on the senior subordinated notes are unconditionally guaranteed  on an unsecured senior subordinated basis  jointly and severally  by all of l communications restricted subsidiaries other than its foreign subsidiaries 
the guarantees of the senior subordinated notes are junior to the guarantees of the senior credit facilities and rank pari passu with each other and the guarantees of the convertible notes and the codes 
the convertible notes and codes are unconditionally guaranteed  on an unsecured senior subordinated basis  jointly and severally  by l communications and substantially all of its direct and indirect material domestic subsidiaries 
these guarantees rank junior to the guarantees of the senior credit facilities and rank pari passu with each other and the guarantees of the senior subordinated notes 
the senior credit facilities also limit the payment of dividends by l communications to l holdings except for payment of franchise taxes  fees to maintain l holdings legal existence  income taxes up to certain amounts  interest accrued on the convertible notes and codes or to provide for operating costs of up to million annually 
under the covenant  l communications may also pay permitted dividends to l holdings from its excess cash  as defined  up to a cumulative amount of million  provided that the debt ratio is no greater than to as of the most recent fiscal quarter 
as a result  at december   million of l communications net assets were available for payment of dividends to l holdings 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our debt and related financial covenants at december  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda our ebitda was million for  million for and million for we define ebitda as operating income plus depreciation expense and amortization expense 
other than our amount of debt and interest expense  ebitda is the major component in the calculation of the debt ratio and interest coverage ratio which are part of the financial covenants for our debt 
the debt ratio is defined as the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda 
the interest coverage ratio is equal to the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated cash interest expense 
the higher our ebitda is on a relative basis to our outstanding debt  the lower our debt ratio will be 
a lower debt ratio indicates a higher borrowing capacity 
similarly  an increase in our ebitda on a relative basis to consolidated cash interest expense  results in a higher interest coverage ratio  which indicates a greater capacity to service debt 
ebitda is presented as additional information because we believe it to be a useful indicator of an entity s debt capacity and its ability to service its debt 
ebitda is not a substitute for operating income  net income or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
ebitda is not a complete net cash flow measure because ebitda is a financial performance measurement that does not include reductions for cash payments for an entity s obligation to service its debt  fund its working capital and capital expenditures and pay its income taxes 
rather  ebitda is one potential indicator of an entity s ability to fund these cash requirements 
ebitda as we defined it may differ from similarly named measures used by other entities and  consequently could be misleading unless all entities calculate and define ebitda in the same manner 
ebitda is also not a complete measure of an entity s profitability because it does not include costs and expenses for depreciation and amortization  interest and income taxes

equity 
on june   we sold million shares of l holdings common stock in a public offering for per share 
upon closing  we received net proceeds of million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses 
as mentioned above  the net proceeds from this sale and the simultaneous sale of the june notes were used to repay million borrowed on march   under our senior subordinated bridge loan facility  repay the indebtedness outstanding under our senior credit facilities  repurchase and redeem the senior subordinated notes due discussed above and increase cash and cash equivalents 
on april   we announced that our board of directors had authorized a two for one stock split on all shares of our common stock 
the stock split entitled all shareholders of record at the close of business on may  to receive one additional share of our common stock for every share held on that date 
the additional shares were distributed to shareholders in the form of a stock dividend on may  upon completion of the stock spilt  we had approximately million shares of common stock outstanding 
on may   we sold million shares of l holdings common stock in a public offering for per share 
in addition  as part of the transaction  other selling stockholders  including affiliates of lehman brothers inc  sold million secondary shares 
upon closing  we received net proceeds of million  which we used to repay borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facilities  pay for the kdi and eer acquisitions and increase cash and cash equivalents 
based upon our current level of operations  we believe that our cash from operating activities  together with available borrowings under the senior credit facilities  will be adequate to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  commitments  research and development expenditures  contingent purchase prices  program and other discretionary investments  and interest payments for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will continue to generate cash flow at current levels  or that currently anticipated improvements will be achieved 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt  we may be required to sell assets  reduce capital expenditures  refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing 
our ability to make scheduled principal payments or to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance and financial results  which  to a certain extent  are subject to general conditions in or affecting the defense industry and to general economic  political  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory factors beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available to enable us to service our indebtedness  to make necessary capital expenditures and to make discretionary investments

on the date of issuance of the codes  we ascribed million of the net proceeds from the codes to those embedded derivatives which represented their aggregate fair value  and recorded it as a liability in accordance with sfas no 
the subsequent increases decreases to the fair values of the embedded derivatives are recorded as losses gains in the statement of operations 
their fair values at december  were million which represents a liability 
interest rate risk 
our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates include borrowings under the senior credit facilities all of which are denominated in us dollars 
there were no outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facilities 
the interest rates on the senior subordinated notes  convertible notes and codes are fixed rate and are not affected by changes in interest rates 
depending on the interest rate environment we may enter into interest rate swap agreements to convert the fixed interest rates on our notes to variable interest rates or terminate any existing agreements 
at december   we do not have any interest swap agreements in place 
when we enter into interest rate agreements  we attempt to manage exposure to counterparty credit risk by only entering into agreements with major financial institutions that are expected to be able to fully perform under the terms of such agreements 
cash payments between us and the counterparties are made in accordance with the terms of the interest rate swap agreements 
such payments are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
additional data on our debt obligations  our applicable borrowing spreads included in the interest rates we pay on borrowings under the senior credit facilities and interest rate agreements are provided in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we conduct some of our operations outside the us in functional currencies other than the us dollar 
additionally  some of our us operations have contracts with foreign customers denominated in foreign currencies 
to mitigate the risk associated with certain of these contracts denominated in foreign currency we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts 
at december   the notional value of foreign currency forward contracts was million and the fair value of these contracts was million  which represents a liability 
we account for these contracts as cash flow hedges 
equity price risk 
our equity investments in common stocks and limited partnerships are subject to equity price risk 
the fair values of our investments are based on quoted market prices  as available  and on historical cost for investments in cases in which it is not practicable to estimate fair value 
both the carrying values and estimated fair values of such instruments amounted to million at the end of backlog and orders we define funded backlog as the value of funded orders which have not yet been recognized as sales 
we define funded orders as the value of contract awards received from the us government  for which the us government has appropriated funds  plus the value of contract awards and orders received from customers other than the us government 
our funded backlog as of december  was  million and as of december  was  million 
we expect to record as sales approximately of our december  funded backlog during however  there can be no assurance that our funded backlog will become sales in any particular period  if at all 
funded orders received were  million for   million for and  million for our funded backlog does not include the full value of our contract awards including those pertaining to multi year  cost plus reimbursable contracts  which are generally funded on an annual basis 
funded backlog also excludes the sales value of unexercised contract options that may be exercised by customers under existing contracts and the sales value of purchase orders that we may receive under indefinite quantity contracts or basic ordering agreements 
research and development company sponsored research and development costs  including bid and proposal costs were million for  million for and million for customer funded research and development costs were million for  million for and million for contingencies we are engaged in providing products and services under contracts with the us government and  to a lesser degree  under foreign government contracts  some of which are funded by the us government 
all such contracts are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements  and  periodically  agencies of the us government investigate whether such contracts were and are being conducted in accordance with these requirements 
under government procurement regulations  an indictment by a federal grand jury could result in the suspension for a period of time from eligibility for awards of new government contracts 
a conviction could result in debarment from contracting with the federal government for a specified term 
additionally  in the event that us government expenditures for products and services of the type we manufacture and provide are reduced and not offset by greater commercial sales or other new programs or products or acquisitions  there may be a reduction in the volume of contracts or subcontracts awarded to us 
we continually assess our obligations with respect to applicable environmental protection laws 
while it is difficult to determine the timing and ultimate cost to be incurred in order to comply with these laws  based upon available internal and external assessments  with respect to those environmental loss contingencies of which we are aware  we believe that even without considering potential insurance recoveries  if any  there are no environmental loss contingencies that  individually or in the aggregate  would be material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
also  we have been periodically subject to litigation  claims or assessments and various contingent liabilities incidental to our business 
we accrue for these contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
in connection with the is acquisition  we assumed responsibility for implementing certain corrective actions  required under federal law to remediate the greenville  texas site location  and to pay a portion of those remediation costs 
the hazardous substances requiring remediation have been substantially characterized  and the remediation system has been partially implemented 
we have estimated that our share of the remediation cost will not exceed million  and will be incurred over a period of years 
we have established adequate reserves for these costs 
on august   acss was sued by honeywell international inc and honeywell intellectual properties  inc collectively  honeywell for alleged infringement of patents that relate to terrain awareness avionics 
the lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the district of delaware 
in december  honeywell withdrew without prejudice the lawsuit against acss and agreed to proceed with non binding arbitration 
if the matter is not resolved through arbitration  honeywell may reinstitute the litigation after august  we had previously investigated the honeywell patents and believe that acss has valid defenses against honeywell s patent infringement suit 
in addition  acss has been indemnified to a certain extent by thales avionics  which provided acss with the alleged infringing technology 
thales avionics owns of acss 
in the opinion of management  the ultimate disposition of honeywell s pending claim will not result in a material liability to us 
on november   we initiated a proceeding against osi systems  inc osi in the united states district court sitting in the southern district of new york the new york action seeking  among other things  a declaratory judgment that we had fulfilled all of our obligations under a letter of intent with osi the osi letter of intent 
under the osi letter of intent  we were to negotiate definitive agreements with osi for the sale of certain businesses we acquired from perkinelmer  inc on june  on december   osi responded by filing suit against us in the united states district court sitting in the central district of california the california action alleging  among other things  that we breached our obligations under the osi letter of intent and seeking damages in excess of million  not including punitive damages 
on february   osi filed an answer and counterclaims in the new york action that asserted substantially the same claims osi had raised in the california action 
we have filed a motion to have the california action dismissed in favor of the new york action 
under the osi letter of intent  we proposed selling to osi the conventional detection business and the argus business that we recently acquired from perkinelmer  inc negotiations with osi lasted for almost one year and ultimately broke down over issues regarding  among other things  intellectual property  product line definitions  allocation of employees and due diligence 
we believe that the claims asserted by osi in its suit are without merit and intend to defend against the osi claims vigorously 
with respect to those investigative actions  items of litigation  claims or assessments of which we are aware  we are of the opinion that the probability is remote that  after taking into account certain provisions that have been made with respect to these matters  the ultimate resolution of any such investigative actions  items of litigation  claims or assessments will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
this interpretation addresses the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees and clarifies when a liability for the obligation undertaken should be recognized 
the initial measurement of the liability is the fair value of the guarantee at its inception 
this interpretation does not prescribe a specific account for the guarantor s offsetting entry when it recognizes the liability at the inception of a guarantee nor does it specify the subsequent measurement of the guarantors recognized liability 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions shall be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are included in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
fin is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the amendments to statement no 
that relate to annual financial statements are effective for our annual financial statements 
the amendments to statement no 
that relate to interim financial statements are effective for our march  financial statements 
we do not intend to adopt the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation which would require us to record a non cash expense for the estimated fair value of stock based compensation grants 
instead we will continue to apply the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
therefore  sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation provides guidance on the identification of  and financial reporting for  entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights 
such entities have been termed by fin as variable interest entities vie 
once effective  fin will be the guidance that determines whether consolidation is required under the controlling financial interest model of arb bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  or whether the variable interest model under fin should be used to account for existing and new entities 
fin includes guidance for identifying the enterprise that will consolidate a vie  which is the enterprise that is exposed to the majority of an entity s risks or receives the majority of the benefits from an entity s activities 
fin also requires that the enterprises that hold a significant variable interest in a vie make new disclosures in their financial statements 
the transitional disclosures of fin  which are effective immediately  require an enterprise to identify the entities in which it holds a variable interest if the enterprise believes that those entities might be considered vies upon the adoption of fin the implementation and remaining disclosure requirements of fin are effective immediately for vie s created after january   and on july   for all vie s created before january  we do not believe that we hold any interests in vies  however  we are currently evaluating whether we hold a variable interest in entities that might be considered vies 
inflation the effect of inflation on our sales and earnings has not been significant 
although a majority of our sales are made under long term contracts  the selling prices of such contracts  established for deliveries in the future  generally reflect estimated costs to be incurred in these future periods 
in addition  some of our contracts provide for price adjustments through cost escalation clauses 
forward looking statements certain of the matters discussed concerning our operations  cash flows  financial position  economic performance  and financial condition  including in particular  the likelihood of our success in developing and expanding our business and the realization of sales from backlog  include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
statements that are predictive in nature  that depend upon or refer to events or conditions or that include words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates and similar expressions are forward looking statements 
although we believe that these statements are based upon reasonable assumptions  including projections of orders  sales  operating margins  earnings  cash flow  research and development costs  working capital  capital expenditures and other projections  they are subject to several risks and uncertainties  and therefore  we can give no assurance that these statements will be achieved 
such statements will also be influenced by factors such as o our dependence on the defense industry and the business risks peculiar to that industry including changing priorities or reductions in the us government defense budget  o our reliance on contracts with a limited number of agencies of  or contractors to  the us government and the possibility of termination of government contracts by unilateral government action or for failure to perform  o our ability to obtain future government contracts on a timely basis  o the availability of government funding and changes in customer requirements for our products and services  o our significant amount of debt and the restrictions contained in our debt agreements  o collective bargaining agreements and labor disputes  o the business and economic conditions in the markets that we operate  including those for the commercial avation and communications markets  o economic conditions  competitive environment  international business and political conditions  timing of international awards and contracts  o our extensive use of fixed price contracts as compared to cost reimbursable contracts  o our ability to identify future acquisition candidates or to integrate acquired operations  o the rapid change of technology and high level of competition in the communication equipment industry  o our introduction of new products into commercial markets or our investments in commercial products or companies  o pension  environmental or legal matters or proceedings and various other market  competition and industry factors  many of which are beyond our control  and o the fair values of our assets including identifiable intangible assets and the estimated fair value of the goodwill balances for our reporting units which can be impaired or reduced by the other factors discussed above 
readers of this document are cautioned that our forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the actual results or developments may differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward looking statements 
as for the forward looking statements that relate to future financial results and other projections  actual results will be different due to the inherent uncertainties of estimates  forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than projected
