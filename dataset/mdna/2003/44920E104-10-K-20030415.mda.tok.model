we then expanded our business to provide streaming audio and video content over six internet television networks  which in the aggregate hosted over distinct channels targeted to various market and segments and niches 
during  we refocused our business model to de emphasize the offering of thematic video on demand networks in favor of a single network of special interest  continuously streaming broadband entertainment channels  using a previously unavailable technology called simulated live stream  or sls 
the company has generated revenues from the above programming via geographic license agreements and technology sales 
initially we sold license rights  from which we were to derive initial up front fees as well as continuing annual fees for each year thereafter 
the company signed two such agreements in the year  which resulted in approximately  received in and in the company sold technology  software and computer hardware for the encoding of the aforementioned streaming video data for approximately  to an affiliate licensee for one time revenues 
the revenues from these affiliate license agreements were recognized over the term of such agreements 
the remaining unearned portion of  was recognized in the year since such license agreements were terminated 
in  we received another  for monthly fees due under an affiliate license agreement 
we have incurred net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and these losses have been mostly financed by the sale of equity in our company and the issuance of equity for services 
on february   we acquired a equity interest in iaccele co  ltd  a privately held japanese corporation engaged in the business of providing an internet data transmission acceleration service that targets narrowband users  as well as broadband users  for million japanese yen  or approximately  based on the japanese yen us dollar exchange rate on that date 
the acquisition of iaccele is a key component to our strategy of shifting our revenue model from broadband entertainment channels and revenues derived from advertising to a renewed focus on developing media technology products and services and on licensing revenues

the sale of the encoding mechanisms was a one time sale arrangement with an affiliate licensee

depreciation and amortization was reduced marginally from to approximately  for from approximately  for due to the write down of assets being placed in service for content production 
we have also written down certain of our fixed assets no longer employed in the production of content due to technological changes with the digitalization equipment utilized for content production and the relocation of our executive offices from new york city to miami  florida  in the amounts of  for the year ended december  and  for year ended december   which includes the closure of the paris operations 
we wrote down capitalized development expenses in the amount of approximately  during our selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   consisting primarily of approximately million in personnel costs including million of equity compensation   in professional and consulting fees and the balance of  is for general administrative expenses such as rent  travel and telephone  as compared to approximately million for  consisting of approximately million in personnel costs including million of equity compensation   in professional and consulting fees  million in general administrative expenses such as rent  travel and telephone

liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our equity securities in our initial public offering  from several private placements and by means of non interest bearing loans  capital contributions from an affiliated person and the issuance of securities for services rendered 
net proceeds from these sales have totaled approximately million as of december   with approximately million raised in the initial public offering and the balance raised in the private placements and equity issued for services in the amount of approximately million 
additional funding was obtained in the form of loans from related parties  of which approximately million was outstanding at december  for the year ended december   we used approximately  in connection with our operating activities 
such amount was primarily attributable to net losses  plus reductions in accounts payable  deferred revenue and accrued expenses offset by decreases in depreciation  stock and options issued for services and unearned compensation expenses 
for the year ended december   approximately  and  were provided by investing activities and financing activities 
we believe that the growth of our operations will depend on our ability to develop and market the iaccele software 
during the year ended december   we made no capital investments 
we expect to have capital expenditures of approximately  in for the development of iaccele 
we will need additional financing in order to finance a portion or all of these capital expenditures 
under our current strategy  we may seek to acquire one or more companies in other areas of media technology 
any such acquisition would require equity or debt financing 
our inability to obtain additional financing will materially adversely affect us  including possibly requiring us to significantly curtail or cease business operations 
as of september   iaj converted  shares of our series a convertible preferred stock the preferred shares for  shares of our common stock the conversion shares 
iaj had acquired the preferred shares from us on october  in a private transaction for an aggregate consideration of  no additional consideration was due from or paid by iaj for the exercise of its right to convert the preferred shares to the conversion shares

the interest rate under the promissory note is per annum 
during the three months ended december   iaj loaned us  pursuant to the terms and conditions of the promissory note  increasing the principal amount to  the proceeds of this loan were for working capital purposes 
the debt under the promissory note is convertible into our series b preferred stock  which is convertible into shares of our common stock 
the issuance of the series b preferred stock is subject to certain conditions including an amendment to our certificate of incorporation increasing our authorized common stock to at least  shares 
as of december   the principal amount of the promissory note was convertible into  shares of our common stock 
as of october   all employees still on the payroll were terminated 
additionally  we relocated our offices to burlingame  california 
on february   we acquired a equity interest in iaccele co  ltd  a privately held japanese corporation engaged in the business of providing an internet data transmission acceleration service that targets narrowband users  as well as broadband users  for million japanese yen  or approximately  based on the japanese yen us dollar exchange rate on that date 
in order to finance this purchase  we borrowed million japanese yen from pbaa fund ltd  a british virgin islands limited liability company 
the principal amount of this loan  together with interest thereon at percent per annum  is due and payable on january  we may defer payment of the principal amount of this loan  but not accrued interest  for one additional year with the consent of pbaa 
we may prepay all or specified minimum portions of this loan at any time after march  upon payment of certain prepayment penalties 
if this loan is not repaid by january   pbaa will be afforded the right to convert any portion of the then unpaid principal amount of the loan  as well as any then accrued but unpaid interest thereon  into shares of our common stock at a per share conversion price equal to the japanese yen equivalent of of the average of the us dollar closing price of our common stock on the american stock exchange in the consecutive trading days immediately prior to the date upon which pbaa gave us notice of conversion  or  if our common stock is not then traded on the american stock exchange  the closing bid price for our common stock as reported by the nasdaq stock market or such other primary exchange or stock bulletin board on which our common stock is then traded 
by way of illustration  had such conversion occurred on february   pbaa would have received  shares of our common stock which  when added to those shares currently beneficially owned by pbaa and its affiliates would increase their collective ownership of our common stock to approximately 
at december   we had  in cash 
we will need to obtain additional financing in in order to continue our current operations and to sustain our cash flow needs  including the cash flow needs of iaccele 
under our current strategy  we may seek to acquire one or more companies in other areas of media technology 
any such acquisition would require equity or debt financing 
our inability to obtain additional financing will materially adversely affect us  including possibly requiring us to significantly curtail or cease business operations 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure on contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgements and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see our note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues are predominately from the license fees earned over the term of the license agreement  unless terminated earlier 
prepaid license fees were deferred until earned on a ratable straight line basis over the term on the agreement 
the revenues from the sale of encoding machines sold were recognized when sold encoding machines were delivered 
cost of sales related to us were comprised predominately of depreciation and amortization costs of the capitalized software and equipment costs  as well as the costs attributed to the assembly of the encoding machines sold 
we apply judgement to ensure that the criteria for recognizing revenues are consistently applied and achieved for all recognized sales transactions 
long lived assets including tangible and intangible assets we acquired and built content for our website to conduct our global business operations 
such costs affected the amount of future period amortization expense and impairment expense that we incur and record as cost of sales 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we assess potential impairment to the intangible and tangible assets on a quarterly basis or when evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
our judgements regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to these assets are based on operational performance of our business  market conditions and other factors 
future events could cause us conclude that impairment indicators exist and that other tangible or intangible assets is impaired 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes 
management judgment is required in determining our provision of our deferred tax asset 
we recorded a valuation for the full deferred tax asset from our net operating losses carried forward due to us not demonstrating any consistent profitable operations 
in the event that the actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust such valuation recorded 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combination  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires the use of the purchase method of accounting and prohibits the use of the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  it also requires that we recognize acquired intangible assets apart from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires  among other things  that companies no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that we identify reporting units for the purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill  reassess the useful lives of other existing recognized intangible assets  and cease amortization of intangible assets with an indefinite useful life 
sfas no 
establishes accounting standards for recognition and measurement of a liability for an asset retirement obligation and the associated asset retirement cost  which will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets which basically further clarifies sfas no 
and methods of quantifying potential impairments or disposal of assets as well as the related reporting of such impairments or disposals 
we have adopted sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this sfas applies to costs associated with an exit activity that does not involve an entity newly acquired in a business combination or with a disposal activity covered by sfas no 
these costs include  but are not limited to the following termination benefits associated with involuntary terminations  terminating contracts that are not capital leases and costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees 
sfas no 
will be effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  with early application encouraged 
during  the fasb issued sfas no 
 and  which were merely amendments to existing sfas s or other accounting pronouncements 
the adoption of sfas no 
 sfas no 
 sfas no 
 sfas no 
and sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
risk factors we have a limited operating history we have a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects  having only commenced our initial business operations in april in addition  we are anticipated shifting the revenue model from broadband entertainment channels and revenues derived from advertising  to a renewed focus on developing media technology products and services and on licensing revenues 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  difficulties and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in an early stage of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as the market for media technology products and services as well as internet broadcasting 
as we have such a limited history of operations  investors will be unable to assess our future operating performance or our future financial results or condition by comparing these criteria against their past or present equivalents 
we have extremely limited cash flow our business requires capital to continue operations 
at the present time  we have not generated material revenues from operations 
to date  our cash flow has primarily come from intermittent sales of our securities and from loans from an affiliated person 
we can give no assurance our cash flow will be sufficient to allow us to continue our operations at present levels 
we will need significant additional financing to continue operations we will require additional financing to expand operations 
we have no current definitive arrangements with respect to additional financing and there can be no assurance that any such financing will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
sales of additional equity securities will result in substantial pro rata dilution to our present stockholders 
our inability to obtain additional financing will materially adversely affect us  including possibly requiring us to significantly curtail operations or to cease operations altogether 
technology stocks in general have recently experienced significant downturns on the financial markets  and the trend is expected to continue indefinitely 
negative investor sentiment for technology stocks will adversely affect our ability to secure additional financing 
low price and trading volume in our stock may result in delisting of trading on the american stock exchange the price and volume at which our stock has recently traded on the american stock exchange does not meet its criteria for continued listing 
although the amex has not officially communicated any intention to us to delist our stock  if our stock were to be delisted  it would materially affect the ability of an investor to dispose of his or her shares of our common stock  and further reduce the liquidity of the investment 
we are dependent on providers of broadband and high speed internet access we have historically relied on providers of broadband and high speed internet access to facilitate the viewing of our sls channels 
until we are successful in marketing our iaccele software  which currently allows narrowband users to accelerate their access to certain aspects of the internet  we will continue to rely on such providers 
if providers of broadband and high speed internet access do not sustain existing operations  or fail to maintain current access speeds  our ability to provide streaming video will be adversely affected 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights we regard our copyrights  trade secrets  trademarks and similar intellectual property as significant to our growth and success 
we rely upon a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secret protection  confidentiality and non disclosure agreements and contractual provisions with our employees and with third parties to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we are unable to assure investors that the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate 
furthermore  we can give no assurance that our business activities will not infringe upon the proprietary rights of others  or that other parties will not assert infringement claims against us 
government regulation of the internet could harm our business there are few laws or regulations directly applicable to the internet 
for example  the digital millennium copyright act  enacted into law in  protects certain qualifying online service providers from copyright infringement liability  the internet tax freedom act  also enacted in  placed a three year moratorium on new state and local taxes on internet access and commerce  and under the communications decency act  an internet service provider will not be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider 
the appeal of the internet makes it likely  however  that state  national or international laws may be implemented in the future covering such issues as user privacy  defamatory speech  copyright infringement  pricing and characteristics and quality of products and services 
any new law or regulation may have the effect of limiting the use of the internet and its growth as a new medium to communicate could harm our business 
we historically have not collected sales or other taxes with respect to the sale of services or products on the internet in states and countries where we believe we are not required to do so 
one or more states or countries have sought to impose sales or other tax obligations on companies that engage in online commerce within their jurisdictions 
a successful assertion by one or more states or countries that we should collect sales or other taxes on products and services  or remit payment of sales or other taxes for prior periods  could adversely affect our business 
the child online protection act of imposes criminal penalties and civil liability on anyone engaged in the business of selling or transferring material that is harmful to minors  by means of the internet  without restricting access to this type of material by underage persons 
numerous states have adopted or are currently considering similar types of legislation 
the imposition upon us of potential liability for broadcasting content that is harmful to minors could require us to implement measures to reduce exposure to liability  which may require the expenditure of substantial resources  or to discontinue various content offerings 
further  the costs of defending against any claims and potential adverse outcomes of these claims could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we rely on certain technologies we license from third parties we rely on certain technologies we license from third parties 
there can be no assurance these third party technology licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
the loss of such technology could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost  which could harm our business 
however  other than our trademarks and service marks  we do not believe that the loss of any particular one of our intellectual property rights would materially harm our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments and do not purchase hedging instruments or other than trading instruments that are likely to expose us to market risk  foreign currency exchange  commodity price or equity price risk 
we have purchased no options and entered into no swaps 
we have no bank borrowing facility that could subject us to the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
on february   we acquired a equity interest in iaccele co  ltd  a privately held japanese corporation engaged in the business of providing an internet data transmission acceleration service that targets narrowband users  as well as broadband users 
iaccele is currently sold through various distribution outlets in japan  including retail stores 
in order to finance the purchase of iaccele  we borrowed million japanese yen from pbaa fund ltd  a british virgin islands limited liability company 
the principal amount of this loan  together with interest thereon at per annum  is due and payable on january  we may defer payment of the principal amount of this loan  but not accrued interest  for one additional year with the consent of pbaa 
we may prepay all or specified minimum portions of this loan at any time after march  upon payment of certain prepayment penalties 
if this loan is not repaid by january   pbaa will be afforded the right to convert any portion of the then unpaid principal amount of the loan  as well as any then accrued but unpaid interest thereon  into shares of our common stock at a per share conversion price equal to the japanese yen equivalent of of the average of the us dollar closing price of our common stock on the american stock exchange in the consecutive trading days immediately prior to the date upon which pbaa gave us notice of conversion  or  if our common stock is not then traded on the american stock exchange  the closing bid price for our common stock as reported by the nasdaq stock market or such other primary exchange or stock bulletin board on which our common stock is then traded 
since we translate foreign currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes  we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations
