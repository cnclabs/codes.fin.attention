item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a national automotive retailer  operating franchises at dealership locations in nine states and markets in the us  offering different brands of vehicles 
we also operate collision repair centers that serve our markets 
our revenues are derived from three basic products the sale of new and used cars and light trucks  maintenance and collision repair services and the sale of all automotive parts  and arranging of vehicle financing and the sale of various insurance and warranty products 
additionally  the company operates a heavy truck business offering four nameplates in atlanta  georgia 
since inception  we have grown through the acquisition of nine large platforms and numerous tuck in acquisitions 
all acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
as a result  the operations of the acquired dealerships are included in the consolidated statements of income commencing on the date acquired 
our gross profit varies with our revenue mix 
the sale of vehicles generally results in lower gross profit margins  while parts  service  collision repair  and finance and insurance revenues produce higher gross profit margins 
as a result  when vehicle sales decrease as a percentage of total sales  our gross profit percentage goes up 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a consist primarily of fixed and incentive based compensation  advertising  rent  insurance  utilities and other typical operating expenses 
a significant portion of our selling expenses are variable such as sales commissions  or controllable expenses such as advertising  generally allowing our cost structure to adapt in response to trends in our business 
sales of motor vehicles particularly new vehicles have historically fluctuated with general macroeconomic conditions including general business cycles  consumer confidence  availability of consumer credit  fuel prices and interest rates 
although these factors may impact our business  we believe that any future negative trends may be mitigated by the performance of our used vehicles sales  parts  service and collision repair operations  our variable cost structure  regional diversity and advantageous brand mix 
our operations are subject to modest seasonal variations that are somewhat offset by our regional diversity 
we typically generate more revenue and operating income in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters 
seasonality is based upon  among other things  weather conditions  manufacturer incentive programs  model changeovers and consumer buying patterns 
results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  net income for the year ended december   was million  or per share basic and diluted 
tax affected pro forma net income for the year ended december  was million or per share basic and diluted 
these pro forma results i exclude a non recurring charge of million related to the establishment of a net deferred tax liability associated with the company s conversion to a corporation and ii include a pro forma tax charge of million as if the company was a corporation for the entire period 
tax affected pro forma net income for the year ended december   excluding the after tax losses from discontinued operations of million  was million  or per share basic and diluted  assuming the  newly issued shares offered in the ipo on march  were offered on january  income from continuing operations before income taxes  minority interest and extraordinary loss totaled million for the year ended december   up over the same period in after adjusting for the elimination of goodwill amortization as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
required companies to stop amortizing goodwill beginning january  the increase can be primarily attributed to higher retail volumes combined with increased margins on new and used vehicles  the continued strength of both our parts  service and collision repair fixed operations and finance and insurance businesses  and the impact of lower interest rates on floor plan and non floor plan financing 
included in the results is a pre tax loss of million from the company s price auto stores 
price currently consists of four stores in houston  texas that sell used vehicles and related finance and insurance products at facilities located on wal mart parking lots 
evaluation of the operating and financial success of the program is ongoing

income tax provision our income tax provision was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  during these years  we were structured primarily as limited liability companies and partnerships with asbury automotive group  llc as the parent  which were treated as partnerships for tax purposes 
under this structure  such companies and partnerships were not subject to income taxes 
therefore  no provision for federal or state income taxes was included in the financial statements for these limited liability companies and partnerships for and however  we also had nine subsidiaries that were c corporations under the provisions of the us internal revenue code 
accordingly  we followed the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes for the and earnings of these subsidiaries 
extraordinary loss on the early extinguishment of debt in connection with the repayment of certain term notes with the proceeds from borrowings under the committed credit facility  we incurred prepayment penalties and wrote off the unamortized portion of deferred finance fees  aggregating million  in the first quarter of we had no extraordinary loss in discontinued operations the million and million income from discontinued operations for the years ended december  and  respectively  reflects the combined net operating income of dealerships sold in or pending sale as of december  liquidity and capital resources we require cash to fund working capital needs  finance acquisitions of new dealerships and fund capital expenditures 
these requirements are met principally from cash flow from operations  borrowings under the committed credit facility  floor plan facilities as defined below  and mortgage notes 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
credit facilities on january   we entered into a committed financing agreement the committed credit facility with ford motor credit company  general motors acceptance corporation and daimlerchrysler services north america llc the lenders with total availability of million 
the committed credit facility is used for acquisition financing and working capital purposes 
at december   million was available for borrowings 
except as noted below  all borrowings under the committed credit facility bear interest at variable rates based on month libor plus a specified percentage that is dependent upon our leverage ratio as defined in the committed credit facility as of the end of each calendar quarter 
the weighted average interest rates  including the amortization of related loan acquisition costs  were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this committed credit facility imposes a blanket lien upon substantially all our assets not otherwise subject to security interests  granted to floor plan lenders or granted to mortgage lenders  and contains covenants that  among other things  place significant restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt  encumber our property and other assets  repay other debt  dispose of assets  invest capital and permit our subsidiaries to issue equity securities 
the terms of our committed credit facility require us on an ongoing basis to meet certain financial ratios  including a current ratio  as defined in our committed credit facility  of at least to  a fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in our committed credit facility  of no less than to  and a leverage ratio  as defined in our committed credit facility  of no greater than to an unwaived or uncured breach of these covenants or any other of the covenants in the committed credit facility would be cause for acceleration of repayment and termination of the facility by the lenders 
during january  we reported to the lenders that we did not meet our fixed charge coverage ratio requirement as of december  non financed capital expenditures are deducted from the numerator of our fixed charge coverage covenant calculation 
the fixed charge coverage ratio default would therefore not have occurred had we obtained financing for two large self funded real estate projects by the end of subsequent to december   we obtained mortgage financing on one of the properties 
we expect to  but can give no assurance that we will  obtain financing for the other property as early as the end of the first fiscal quarter of the lenders subsequently agreed to waive this fixed charge coverage ratio default the waiver agreement by letter dated february  we are not dependent upon the financing of the second self funded real estate project in order for the waiver agreement to remain in full force and effect 
a complete evaluation of our debt agreements revealed potentially material cross default provisions within documentation from two mortgage lenders 
at our request  both mortgage lenders agreed to waive their rights under the cross default provisions of their respective mortgage documentation 
we then informed our lenders that all potentially material cross defaults had been addressed pursuant to the terms previously outlined by the lenders 
as part of the waiver agreement  we committed to provide financial covenant compliance calculations to the lenders on a monthly basis 
the calculations must demonstrate improvement in our fixed charge coverage ratio at the end of each calendar month following january   until such time as our fixed charge coverage ratio exceeds we must demonstrate a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least by january  the committed credit facility also contains provisions for default upon  among other things  a change of control  a material adverse change  the nonpayment of obligations and a default under other agreements 
as of the date of the filing of this form k  we were in compliance with all covenants of the committed credit facility  as modified by the waiver agreement 
the terms of the committed credit facility provide that a default under the floor plan facilities described below  among other obligations  constitutes a default under the committed credit facility 
in connection with the waiver agreement  we agreed that  for the duration of the waiver period  or until our fixed charge coverage ratio is or greater at any month end during the waiver period  whichever is earlier  we will  among other things  not borrow under the committed credit facility for working capital needs we do not plan to use this funding source in the foreseeable future  not make acquisitions without the prior written consent of the lenders and pay interest at the default rate set forth in the committed credit facility 
in addition  during the waiver period  the lenders rescinded their previously issued consent which allowed for the repurchase of our common stock 
see stock repurchase below 
the waiver period will automatically terminate upon the occurrence of any other event of default or unmatured event of default under the committed credit facility or if our fixed charge coverage ratio does not improve in each calendar month following january  during the waiver period  we retain full and complete access to our cash management sublimit 
see cash management sublimit 
the combination of the cash management sublimit availability and cash on hand provided us with over million of cash and cash equivalent liquidity at february  in addition  the committed credit facility is available for acquisitions  provided the acquisition is approved by the lenders 
the committed credit facility requires us to apply of the net proceeds of equity offerings and of the net proceeds of debt offerings to repayment of outstanding indebtedness under the facility 
substantially all our subsidiaries have guaranteed  and substantially all our future subsidiaries will be required to guarantee  our obligations under the committed credit facility 
substantially all of our assets not subject to security interests granted to floor plan lenders or mortgage lenders are subject to security interests to lenders under the committed credit facility 
we pay annually in arrears a commitment fee for the committed credit facility of of the undrawn amount available to us 
the committed credit facility provides for an indefinite series of one year extensions at our request  if approved by the lenders at their sole discretion 
conversely  we can terminate the committed credit facility by repaying all of the outstanding balances under the facility plus a termination fee 
the termination fee is currently equal to of the lenders commitment as defined in the committed credit facility and becomes zero on january  even if we terminate the committed credit facility  each lender is entitled to retain its security interest in all existing and future collateral until all floor plan facilities have been repaid and terminated 
the committed credit facility has been extended by the lenders through january  senior subordinated notes on june   we issued senior subordinated notes in the aggregate principal amount of  the notes  receiving net proceeds of  the million costs related to the issuance of the notes were capitalized and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes 
the net proceeds from the notes issuance were utilized to repay certain indebtedness under our committed credit facility 
we pay interest on the notes on june and december of each year 
the notes will mature on june  at any time on or after june   we may  at our option  choose to redeem all or a portion of the notes at a redemption price that begins at of the aggregate principal amount of the notes and reduces in each calendar year by until the price reaches of the aggregate principal amount in and thereafter 
on or before june   we may  at our option  use the net proceeds of one or more equity offerings to redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes at a redemption price equal to of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon 
at any time before june   we may  at our own option  choose to redeem all or a portion of the notes at a price equal to of their principal amount plus the make whole premium set forth in the note indenture 
the notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our current subsidiaries and all of our future domestic restricted subsidiaries that have outstanding  incur or guarantee any other indebtedness 
the notes and the subsidiary guarantees will rank behind all of our and the subsidiary guarantors current and future indebtedness  other than trade payables  except any future indebtedness that expressly provides that it ranks equally with  or is subordinated in right of payment to  the notes and subsidiary guarantees 
the notes will rank equally with all of our and our subsidiary guarantors future senior subordinated indebtedness 
the notes will be effectively subordinated to all debt of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes 
the terms of the senior subordinated notes restrict our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness and sell assets 
as of december   we had the following contractual obligations total thereafter floor plan financing   long term debt including capital lease obligations   operating leases      guarantee liability   total       includes million of mortgage debt that we anticipate refinancing to long term 
guarantees we have guaranteed three loans made by financial institutions either directly to platform management or to non consolidated entities controlled by platform management which totaled approximately million at december  two of these guarantees  made on behalf of two platform executives in november  were made in conjunction with those executives acquiring equity in one of our subsidiaries 
the primary obligors of these notes are the platform executives 
in each of these cases we believed that it was important for each of the individuals to have equity at risk 
we recorded a liability of million as of december   to reflect our estimate of the probable liability under these guarantees  and  was charged to operations in  net of anticipated collateral recoveries 
the third guarantee was made by a corporation acquired by us in october and guarantees an industrial revenue bond 
the primary obligors of this note are a non dealership business entity and that entity s partners as individuals 
under the terms of the industrial revenue bond  we could not remove ourselves as a guarantor 
the note is fully collateralized by the underlying property of the business entity 
floor plan facilities on january   and in connection with the committed credit facility  the company obtained uncommitted floor plan financing lines of credit for new and used vehicles the floor plan facilities 
we refinanced substantially all of our then existing floor plan debt under the floor plan facilities 
the floor plan facilities do not have specified maturities 
they bear interest at variable rates based on libor or the prime rate and are provided by ford motor credit company  daimlerchrysler services north america llc and general motors acceptance corporation  with total availability of million 
the weighted average interest rates on our floor plan notes payable were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
ford motor credit company million daimlerchrysler services north america llc million general motors acceptance corporation million total floor plan lines million in addition  we have ancillary floor plan facilities with comerica bank and navistar financial for our heavy truck business within our atlanta platform 
outstandings under these facilities totaled million as of december  we finance substantially all of our new vehicle inventory and a portion of our used vehicle inventory under the floor plan facilities 
we are required to make monthly interest payments on the amount financed but are not required to repay the principal prior to the sale of the vehicle 
the floor plan facilities also provide used vehicle financing up to a fixed percentage of the value of each financed used vehicle 
these floor plan arrangements grant a security interest in the financed vehicles as well as the related sales proceeds 
as of december   we had million outstanding under all of our floor plan financing agreements 
mortgages as of december   we had outstanding real estate mortgages at six operating platforms totaling million 
the mortgage notes bear interest at fixed and variable rates the weighted average interest rates were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these obligations are secured by the related real estate and mature between and under the terms of our committed credit facility  no guarantees from us or any of our subsidiaries are allowed in support of our mortgage notes  however  certain indebtedness which was in place prior to the credit facility is subject to guarantees 
our lenders have taken a second mortgage position behind the respective first lien holder on all of our financed real estate except for one property 
during  we expect to refinance approximately million of mortgage debt  currently included in our current portion of long term debt  with either long term mortgages or long term lease agreements pursuant to sales leaseback transactions 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to refinance or replace through sales leaseback transactions these mortgages  or that the rates and terms of any refinanced mortgage or sales leaseback transaction will be comparable to terms currently in place 
cash management sublimit during the third quarter of  we obtained consent from the lenders for a cash management sublimit of million under our committed credit facility 
the cash management sublimit allows us to repay up to million of debt outstanding under our committed credit facility  using cash that has been centrally collected by our new cash management system 
the net amount repaid under the cash management sublimit is available to be borrowed by us on short term notice for general corporate purposes 
as of december  and february   we had million and million  respectively  available for borrowings under our cash management sublimit 
cash flow operating activities cash flow from operations totaled million for the year ended december   as net income of million plus non cash items of million primarily depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes were offset by a million use of cash from the net change in operating assets and liabilities

cash flow from operations totaled million for the year ended december   consisting of net income of million  non cash items of million primarily depreciation and amortization and net losses from unconsolidated affiliates and a million source of cash from the net change in operating assets and liabilities

capital expenditures capital spending for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
capital spending other than from acquisitions during the year ended december   was primarily related to operational improvements and manufacturer required spending to upgrade existing dealership facilities 
we expect to spend approximately to million on capital expenditures in pending acquisitions and acquisition financing we have signed a purchase agreement to acquire bob baker auto group baker of san diego  california  a dealer group consisting of six dealerships and ten franchises  for million  plus anticipated transaction costs 
we expect to fund million of this transaction with a combination of internal cash and borrowing under our committed credit facility  with the remaining portion of the purchase price to be funded using shares of our common stock  either through the issuance of additional shares or through shares repurchased on the open market as described in the stock repurchase section below 
shares delivered in conjunction with the baker acquisition will be subject to the same lock up provisions as the shares issued to our platform principals in conjunction with our ipo  which are in effect until march  we have received or expect to receive consents from all manufacturers that are involved with the pending acquisition other than ford 
ford has informed us that it does not intend to approve the acquisition of the bob baker ford franchise  claiming that we have not complied with our contractual agreement with ford 
we disagree with ford s position and are pursuing a resolution of this matter 
in addition  the company and toyota motor sales  usa are engaged in continuing discussions about the terms and conditions necessary to obtain toyota s approval of the baker acquisition 
we cannot give any assurances that we will receive all of the required manufacturer consents 
failure to receive such consents would likely prevent the consummation of the baker acquisition 
if the acquisition is consummated  we expect it to be accretive to earnings per share in stock repurchase the committed credit facility as originally drafted prohibited us from repurchasing our common stock 
in november  the lenders consented to allow us the ability to repurchase our shares provided that no events of default exist or continue 
during january  we suspended our stock repurchase program in connection with the waiver agreement with the lenders 
we intend to resume our share repurchase program  once we cure the fixed charge coverage default that has been waived by the lenders under the waiver agreement 
pursuant to our senior subordinated note indenture  we are permitted to repurchase shares under the following restrictions i up to million under a restricted payments building basket  plus ii up to million per fiscal year under our stock repurchase basket 
the restricted payments building basket equals the greater of million  or of the consolidated net income beginning april  less the cumulative amount of any restricted payments since the notes inception 
during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for a purchase price of million 
in  we repurchased an additional  shares for an aggregate purchase price of million  thereby leaving million available for future share repurchases 
off balance sheet transactions we had no off balance sheet transactions during the years presented other than those already disclosed in notes and of our consolidated financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and assumptions and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary 
the accounting policies described below are those that most frequently require management to make estimates and judgments  and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we use the specific identification method and the first in  first out method fifo to account for our inventories 
we maintain a reserve for specific inventory units where cost basis exceeds fair value 
these reserves were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
in assessing lower of cost or market for new vehicles  we primarily consider the aging of vehicles along with the timing of annual and model changeovers 
the assessment of lower of cost or market for used vehicles considers recent data and trends such as loss histories  current aging of the inventory and current market conditions 
notes receivable finance contracts as of december   we had outstanding notes receivable from finance contracts of million net of an allowance for credit losses of million 
these notes have initial terms ranging from to months  and are collateralized by the related vehicles 
the assessment of our allowance for credit losses considers historical loss ratios and the performance of the current portfolio with respect to past due accounts 
we continually analyze our current portfolio against our historical performance 
in addition  we attribute minimal value to the underlying collateral in our assessment of the reserve 
chargeback reserve we receive commissions from the sale of various insurance contracts  vehicle service contracts to customers and through the arrangement of financing vehicles for customers 
we may be charged back chargeback for such commissions in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers 
the revenues from financing fees and commissions are recorded at the time of the sale of the vehicles and a reserve for future chargebacks is established at that time 
the reserve carefully considers our historical chargeback experience  including timing  as well as national industry trends 
this data is evaluated on a product by product basis 
these reserves were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
intangible assets our intangible assets relate primarily to the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired goodwill 
we account for acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting as required by sfas no 
business combinations 
additionally we separately recognize intangible assets when their benefit is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged  regardless of our intent to do so 
our principal identifiable intangible assets are franchise rights with vehicle manufacturers 
these franchise rights have indefinite lives 
all other identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives typically three to fifteen years and are tested for impairment when circumstances warrant 
we evaluate indefinite live intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets which requires  at a minimum  an annual test of impairment 
we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that intangible assets become impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of the related underlying business 
related party transactions certain of our directors  shareholders and their affiliates  and platform management  have engaged in transactions with us 
these transactions primarily relate to long term operating leases of facilities 
rent expense attributable to related parties was million during the year ended december  and future minimum payments under related party long term non cancelable operating leases as of december  were million 
this practice is fairly common in the automotive retail industry 
we have an option to acquire certain properties from one of our shareholders 
the purchase option  initially based on the aggregate appraised value  adjusts each year for movements in the consumer price index 
the purchase option of  can only be exercised in total 
during  we paid million in advertising fees to an entity in which one of our directors has a substantial interest 
during  we paid  in legal fees to a law firm in which one of our directors was of counsel 
in april  we acquired land from one of our directors for million for the purpose of expanding the operations of one of our dealerships 
in august  we acquired land from one of our directors for million  for the purpose of constructing a new body shop facility 
we believe these transactions involved terms comparable to terms that would be obtained from an unaffiliated third party 
new accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of sfas no 
 and technical correction 
this statement eliminates extraordinary accounting treatment for reporting gain or loss on debt extinguishment  and amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections

in september  sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities was issued 
this statement provides guidance on the recognition and measurement of liabilities associated with exit or disposal activities and requires that such liabilities be recognized when incurred 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated on or after january   and does not impact recognition of costs under our existing programs 
adoption of this standard may impact the timing of recognition of costs associated with future exit and disposal activities  depending upon the nature of the actions initiated 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires a guarantor to recognize a liability  at the inception of the guarantee  for the fair value of obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee and also include more detailed disclosures with respect to guarantees 
fin is effective for guarantees issued or modified starting january   and requires the additional disclosures for the period ended december  we do not expect that the provisions of fin will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
we have provided additional disclosure with respect to guarantees in note in december  sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure was issued 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we have adopted the disclosure requirements of the interpretation as of december  reconciliation of non gaap financial information for analysis purposes  in management s discussion and analysis we discuss pro forma net income from continuing operations and related earnings per share for the year ended december   because that is the measurement favored by analysts

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness 
given amounts outstanding at december   a basis point change in variable interest rates would result in a change of approximately million to our annual non floor plan interest expense 
based on floor plan amounts outstanding at december   a basis point change in variable interest rates would result in a million change to annual floor plan interest expense 
generally vehicle manufacturers grant floor plan interest credits  although they are under no obligation to do so 
such floor plan credits typically track changes in floor plan expense 
derivative financial instruments we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
during the second quarter of and in connection with its subordinated debt refinancing  we terminated three swap agreements  having a combined total notional principal amount of million  all maturing in november in connection with these terminations  we incurred a  loss  which is being amortized to interest expense over the remainder of the original agreement see note of the consolidated financial statements
