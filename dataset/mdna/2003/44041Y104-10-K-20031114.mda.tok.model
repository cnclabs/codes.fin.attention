critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion should be read in conjunction with note significant accounting policies and estimates in notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein which describes in more detail the company s significant accounting policies and estimates 
the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis  with the exception of the company s adoption of fas and fas effective september   as described in note  goodwill and other intangible assets included elsewhere herein 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods 
the company s senior management has discussed the critical accounting estimates with the company s audit committee 
the company continually evaluates its accounting policies and the estimates it uses to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
in general  the estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other sources and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if o it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and o changes in the estimate  or the use of different estimating methods that could have been selected  could have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
the following presents information about the company s most critical accounting estimates 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
allowances are based on the likelihood of recoverability of accounts receivable considering such factors as past experience and taking into account current collection trends that are expected to continue 
factors taken into consideration in estimating the allowance are amounts past due  in dispute  or a client that the company believes might be having financial difficulties 
if economic  industry  or specific customer business trends worsen beyond earlier estimates  the company increases the allowances for doubtful accounts by recording additional expense 
legal fees expended in the pursuit of the outstanding amounts are considered recovered prior to the reversal of any previously written off bad debt 
medical claims medical claims payable represents the liability for healthcare claims reported but not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported ibnr related to the company s managed behavioral healthcare business 
the ibnr portion of medical claims payable is estimated based upon authorized healthcare services  past claims payment experience for member groups  enrollment data  utilization statistics and other factors using both accounting and actuarial methodologies 
although variability is inherent in such estimates  management believes the recorded liability for medical claims payable is adequate 
medical claim payable balances are monitored and reviewed monthly and actuarially certified  by an independent third party actuarial firm  on an annual basis 
changes in assumptions for care costs caused by changes in actual or expected experience could cause these estimates to change significantly 
reserves for these liabilities at august  and were million and million  respectively 
a increase in the assumed utilization of healthcare services would reduce net income by million after tax on an annualized basis 
this charge would impact the company s hbs segment
