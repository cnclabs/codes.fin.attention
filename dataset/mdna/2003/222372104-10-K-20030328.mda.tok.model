item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s core business is residential mortgage banking 
historically  the mortgage banking business was the primary source of the company s earnings and the focus of its capital investment 
the company s results of operations historically have been influenced primarily by the level of demand for mortgage loans  which is affected by external factors such as prevailing mortgage rates and the strength of the us housing market 
in recent years  the company has expanded its operations beyond mortgage banking 
the company now has five business segments mortgage banking  insurance  capital markets  global and banking 
this diversification has been pursued to capitalize on meaningful synergies with the company s core mortgage banking business and to provide sources of earnings that are not as cyclical as the mortgage banking business 
critical accounting policies the accounting policies that have the greatest impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations and that require the most judgment are those relating to its mortgage securitization activities and the ongoing valuation of retained interests  particularly mortgage servicing rights msrs  that arise from those activities  as well as the company s interest rate risk management activities 
the company s critical accounting policies involve accounting for gains on sales of loans and securities  valuation of msrs and other retained interests  amortization of msrs and accounting for derivatives and interest rate risk management activities 
gain on sale of loans and securities the company securitizes substantially all of the mortgage loans it produces and sells those securities on a regular basis in the secondary mortgage market 
by products of those securitizations are certain retained interests  including msrs  interest only securities  principal only securities and residual securities  which the company generally holds as long term investments 
in effect  the company determines the gain on sale of a security by allocating the acquisition cost of the underlying mortgage loans between the securities sold and the retained interests  based on their relative estimated fair values 
the reported gain on sale is the difference between the cash proceeds from the sale and the cost allocated to the securities sold 
following is an example of the application of this accounting concept acquisition cost of mortgage loans underlying a security fair values security retained interests total fair value computation of gain on sale of security sales proceeds less allocated cost  x  gain on sale initial recorded value of retained interests   valuation of retained interests the determination of fair values of retained interests at the initial recording and on an ongoing basis requires considerable judgment 
unlike government securities and other highly liquid investments  the precise market value of retained interests is not readily ascertainable because these assets are not actively traded in stand alone markets 
as discussed in the following paragraphs  the company uses available market data  along with its own empirical data and discounted cash flow models  to arrive at the estimated fair values of its retained interests 
once recorded  retained interests are periodically evaluated for impairment  which is defined generally as a reduction in current fair value below carrying value 
if msrs are impaired  the impairment is recognized in current period earnings and the carrying value of the msrs is adjusted through a valuation allowance 
if the value of the msrs subsequently increases  the recovery in value is recognized in current period earnings and the carrying value of the msrs is adjusted through a reduction in the valuation allowance 
as of december   the msr impairment valuation allowance was billion 
if impairment is deemed to be other than temporary  the valuation allowance is applied to reduce the cost basis of the msrs 
a msr cannot be carried above its amortized cost basis 
for other retained interests  which are held as available for sale securities  impairment is recognized as a reduction to shareholders equity net of tax 
if the impairment is deemed to be other than temporary  it is recognized in current period earnings 
once permanently impaired  subsequent increases in the value of other retained interests are recognized in earnings over the remaining life of the investment through a higher effective yield 
the company estimates the fair value of its msrs through the use of a proprietary option adjusted spread oas cash flow model 
the model utilizes a stochastic interest rate model in conjunction with proprietary mortgage prepayment models to simulate msr cash flows over multiple interest rate paths and derive an expected present  or estimated fair  value 
cash flows associated with msrs and incorporated in the model consist of net service fees  float earnings on escrow balances  late charges  prepayment penalties  ancillary fees  servicing operating costs  costs related to advancing delinquent mortgage payments  and foreclosure related costs 
the cash flow assumptions are derived from the company s own empirical data drawn from the recent historical experience of its msrs 
for the other retained interests  the company estimates fair value through the use of proprietary  static single rate path discounted cash flow models 
the company has evolved its methodologies for valuing msrs and other retained interests in concert with the industry and with the objective of providing improved estimates of fair value 
the company has incorporated assumptions in its valuation models it believes other major market participants would presently consider in deriving the fair value of msrs and other retained interests 
at december   the company s investment in msrs was stratified as follows dollar amounts in millions total p ortfolio weighted mortgage principal percent average msr rate balance of total matu rity years balance and under  over  excludes subservicing 
the key assumptions used in the valuation of msrs and other retained interests include mortgage prepayment speeds  the oas or discount rate  as appropriate  and for residual interests that contain credit risk  the lifetime credit losses 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations credit risk section of this document for further discussion of credit risk 
the company estimates mortgage prepayment speeds using proprietary  statistical  multi factor  pool level models that have been developed for each major loan type using historical  loan level data from the company s mortgage servicing portfolio 
the primary factors driving prepayment speeds in the models are housing turnover  refinance incentive  forecasted housing price appreciation  loan age and burnout 
the models derive single month mortality smm rates based on the modeled mortgage rate 
the modeled mortgage rate is a function of the simulated short term and long term rates derived from the company s interest rate model 
the company s stochastic interest rate model utilizes the swap curve and option prices to develop the simulated interest rates 
the company has benchmarked its mortgage prepayment models against other commercially available models  as well as  on an ongoing basis  to its actual portfolio prepayment experience 
the company periodically refits its prepayment models using its most recent portfolio data 
the company determines oas and discount rates by reference to available market data 
for msrs  the company applies a different oas depending on the servicing type 
as of december   the oas ranged from for conventional  conforming msrs to for subprime msrs 
the oas is added to the simulated forward libor rate to arrive at the discreet discount rate used in each period within the cash flow model 
the oas is evaluated periodically based upon analysis of the following market data as available msr bulk and flow transactions  sales of new mortgage loans on a servicing released basis  msr broker valuations  trust i o and company i o prices  and peer group surveys 
the company estimates lifetime mortgage credit losses using proprietary  statistical  multi factor pool level models that have been developed for prime home equity and subprime loans using historical  loan level data from the company s mortgage servicing portfolio as well as available loan level data from third parties 
the primary factors driving lifetime credit losses in the models are fico credit scores  loan to value ratio  loan balance  documentation type and forecasted housing price appreciation 
the company compares the credit loss estimates derived from its models on new mortgage pools to those loss estimates developed by the rating agencies and mortgage insurance companies 
the company periodically refits its credit loss models using the most recent portfolio data 
the following table shows the value sensitivity of the msrs and other retained interests to the key assumptions used by the company to determine their fair values at december  dollar amounts in thousands msrs other retaine d interests fair value of retained interests   weighted average life in years weighted average annual prepayment speed impact of adverse change   impact of adverse change   weighted average oas over libor curve n a weighted average annual discount rate n a impact of adverse change   impact of adverse change   weighted average lifetime credit losses impact of adverse change   impact of adverse change   these sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution 
the preceding information is furnished to provide the reader with a basis for assessing the sensitivity of the values presented to changes in assumptions 
as the figures indicate  changes in fair value based on a variation in individual assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear 
in addition  in the above table  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated without changing any other assumption 
in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another  which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
msr amortization in addition to periodic fair value estimations  msrs are also subject to periodic amortization 
the company computes msr amortization by applying the ratio of the net msr cash flows projected for the current period to the estimated total remaining net msr cash flows 
the estimated total net msr cash flows are determined at the beginning of each reporting period  using prepayment assumptions applicable at that time 
derivatives and interest rate risk management activities the company utilizes derivatives extensively in connection with its interest rate risk management activities 
in accordance with sfas  all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value 
the company may qualify some of its interest rate risk management activities for hedge accounting under sfas to qualify for hedge accounting under sfas  the company must demonstrate  on an ongoing basis  that its interest rate risk management activity is highly effective 
the company determines the effectiveness of its interest rate risk management activities using standard statistical measures 
if the company is unable to qualify certain of its interest rate risk management activities for hedge accounting  then the change in fair value of the associated derivative financial instruments would be reflected in current period earnings  but the change in fair value of the related asset or liability may not  thus creating a possible earnings mismatch 
this issue is potentially most significant regarding msrs  which absent the application of hedge accounting  are required to be carried at the lower of amortized cost or market 
the company has qualified a significant portion of its servicing hedge for hedge accounting under sfas at times in the past  and management believes it can do so in the future 
in connection with its mortgage loan origination activities  the company issues interest rate lock commitments irlcs to loan applicants and financial intermediaries 
the irlcs guarantee the loan terms  subject to credit approval  for a period of time while the application is in process  primarily between and days 
irlcs are derivative instruments as defined by sfas and  therefore  are required to be recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in current period earnings 
however  unlike most other derivative instruments  there is no active market for irlcs that can be used to determine an irlc s fair value 
consequently  the company has developed a methodology for estimating the fair value of its irlcs the company estimates the fair value of an irlc based on the change in estimated fair value of the underlying mortgage loan  given the probability that the loan will fund within the terms of the irlc 
the change in fair value of the underlying mortgage loan is based upon quoted mbs prices 
the change in fair value of the underlying mortgage loan is measured from the lock date 
therefore  at the time of issuance the estimated fair value of an irlc is zero 
subsequent to issuance  the value of an irlc can be either positive or negative  depending on the change in value of the underlying mortgage loan 
the probability that the loan will fund within the terms of the irlc is driven by a number of factors  in particular  the change  if any  in mortgage rates subsequent to the lock date 
in general  the probability increases if mortgage rates rise and decreases if mortgage rates fall 
this is due primarily to the relative attractiveness of current mortgage rates compared to the applicant s committed rate 
the probability that a loan will fund within the terms of the irlc also is influenced by the source of the applications  age of the applications  purpose for the loans purchase or refinance and the application approval rate 
the company has developed closing ratio estimates fallout curves using its historical empirical data that take into account all of these variables  as well as renegotiations of rate and point commitments that tend to occur when mortgage rates fall 
the fallout curves are utilized to estimate the quantity of loans that will fund within the terms of the irlcs 
change in fiscal year effective december   the company changed its year end from february to december for purposes of this annual report on form k  the company s consolidated statements of earnings  consolidated statement of common shareholders equity  consolidated statements of cash flows and consolidated statements of comprehensive income consist of the year ended december   the ten months ended december  and the year ended february  management changed the company s year end to conform its reporting periods with those required by the board of governors of the federal reserve for regulatory reporting purposes 
the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of this form k compares financial information for the twelve months ended december  and the twelve months ended november  change of corporate name on november   the name of the corporation was changed from countrywide credit industries  inc to countrywide financial corporation 
management believes that the company s new name more accurately reflects the full array of products and services offered to consumers and institutional customers through the countrywide family of companies 
comparison of results of operations for the year ended december  audited to the twelve months ended november  unaudited consolidated earnings performance the company s diluted earnings per share for was  a increase over diluted earnings per share for net earnings increased from this earnings performance was driven principally by the record level of residential mortgage loans produced by the company billion during in comparison to billion for industry wide  residential mortgage originations were approximately trillion during  up from approximately trillion in calendar source fannie mae 
approximately of the residential mortgages produced in were refinances triggered by historically low mortgage rates 
the balance of mortgages produced related to home purchases 
partially fueled by the level of mortgage rates  activity in the us housing market also reached record levels in the record demand for residential mortgages not only drove record loan production volumes but also high loan production margins for the company 
the combination of record volumes and high margins increased loan production sector pre tax earnings to billion for  an increase of  or billion from the high levels of mortgage refinances and home purchases in resulted in significant prepayments within the company s mortgage loan servicing portfolio during the year 
this  along with the expectation of continued higher than normal prepayments in the future due to historically low mortgage rates  resulted in significant amortization and impairment of the company s msrs and other retained interests in the combined amount of amortization and impairment of msrs and other retained interests  net of servicing hedge gains  was billion  resulting in a pre tax loss of billion in the loan servicing sector in  billion more than the pre tax loss in overall  the mortgage banking segment generated pre tax earnings of million for  an increase of over the company s non mortgage banking businesses also were significant contributors to the overall record earnings performance in in particular  the capital markets segment had pre tax earnings of million  as compared to million for capital markets has grown its core franchise significantly over the last five years and is now among the leading investment banking firms in its niche  the mortgage backed securities market 
this segment continued to benefit from robust activity in the mortgage backed securities market  as well as from a highly favorable interest rate environment 
in total  non mortgage banking businesses contributed million in pre tax earnings for of consolidated pre tax earnings  an increase of from million of consolidated pre tax earnings for operating segment results the company s pre tax earnings by segment are summarized below year ended y ear ended dollar amounts in thousands december  nove mber  mortgage banking production  servicing  closing services  total mortgage banking  other businesses insurance  capital markets  global operations  banking  other  total other businesses  pre tax earnings  mortgage banking segment the mortgage banking segment includes loan production  loan servicing and loan closing services 
the loan production and loan closing services sectors generally perform at their best when mortgage rates are relatively low and loan origination volume is high 
conversely  the loan servicing sector generally performs well when mortgage rates are relatively high and loan prepayments are low 
the natural counterbalance of these sectors reduces the impact of changes in mortgage rates on the company s earnings 
during  historically low mortgage rates drove record levels of mortgage originations and prepayments industry wide  resulting in record profits in the loan production and loan closing services sectors and record losses in the loan servicing sector 
loan production sector the loan production sector produces mortgage loans through chl s three production divisions consumer markets  wholesale lending and correspondent lending and through full spectrum lending  inc the pre tax earnings of the loan production sector are summarized below 
year ended year ended dollar amounts in thousands december  november  percent of lo an percent of loan dollars volume dollars volume revenues  expenses  pre tax earnings  the record demand for mortgages enabled the loan production sector to achieve significant growth in revenues and earnings in this performance was enhanced by a significant increase in market share during the year 
the company s mortgage origination market share was in  up from in calendar source inside mortgage finance 
favorable market conditions enabled the company to increase revenues earned on prime first mortgage loans  while high levels of productivity during helped keep unit costs low 
these factors combined to produce record profit margins pre tax earnings as a percentage of loan volume for the loan production sector 
the following table shows total loan volume by division mortgage banking loan production year ended year ended dollar amounts in millions december  n ovember  correspondent lending division  wholesale lending division  consumer markets division  full spectrum lending  inc  does not include treasury bank origiantions totaling million in overall loan production for increased in comparison to the increase was due to a rise in both purchase and non purchase loan production of and  respectively 
the increase in purchase money loans is significant as this is the relatively stable growth component of the mortgage market  with average annual growth of over the last years 
the non purchase  or refinance  component of the mortgage market is highly volatile as it is driven almost exclusively by prevailing mortgage rates 
all divisions  in particular correspondent lending  contributed to the increase in origination volume 
the correspondent lending division has benefited most from the consolidation trend in the industry 
in  the top five correspondent lenders combined had a share of the correspondent origination market  up from in the following table summarizes loan production by purpose and by interest rate type mortgage banking loan production year ended year ended dollar amounts in millions december  nove mber  purpose purchase  non purchase  interest rate type fixed rate  adjustable rate  does not include treasury bank origiantions totaling million in as shown in the following table  the volume of prime home equity and subprime mortgages produced which is included in the company s total volume of loans produced increased during the current period from the prior year mortgage banking prime home equity an d subprime mortgage produc tion year ended year ended dollar amounts in millions december  november  prime home equity  subprime  percent of total loan production does not include treasury bank origiantions totaling million in prime home equity and subprime loans carry higher profit margins historically and the demand for such loans is believed to be less rate sensitive than the demand for prime first mortgage loans 
the company successfully retained a significant percentage of the customers who prepaid their mortgages during the period 
the overall retention rate for the year was and for retail customers the rate was 
notably  of the consumer market division s total loan production during the period was sourced from the company s servicing portfolio 
the high retention rates during the period were due  in part  to the high level of refinancing transactions 
the company has been most successful retaining customers who refinance their existing mortgages in such an environment 
during the year ended december   of the consumer markets division s refinance loan volume was from existing mortgage customers 
this synergy is a major source of intrinsic value derived from the company s msr investment 
during  the loan production sector operated at approximately of planned operational capacity 
the primary capacity constraint in the company s loan origination activities is the number of loan operations personnel it has on staff 
therefore  the company measures planned capacity with reference to the number of loan operations personnel it has on staff multiplied by the number of loans it expects each available loan operations staff person to process under normal conditions 
the company continued to increase the number of sales and operations staff in its loan production divisions in to capitalize upon the current market environment 
when loan volumes moderate  the operations staff including a significant number of temporary employees will be reduced 
however  the company plans to continue building its sales staff despite any potential drop in loan origination volume as a primary means to increase the company s market share 
the following table summarizes the loan production sector workforce workforce at december  november sales  operations regular employees  temporary staff  production technology administration and support  in recent years  the consumer markets division has commenced a fundamental restructuring of its business model primarily by building a best in class sales organization  consisting of a dedicated commissioned sales force and the attendant management  systems and operations support 
in addition  to create more flexible processing capacity to support the expanded sales organization  as well as the division s growing portfolio retention effort  the consumer markets division has began to centralize some of its processing operations 
at december  the commissioned sales force external home loan consultants numbered  an increase of  during the year 
the primary focus of the external home loan consultants is to increase overall purchase market share 
external home loan consultants contributed billion in purchase originations in  a increase over the prior year 
the purchase production generated by the external home loan consultants represented of the consumer market division s purchase production for at december   the consumer markets division had branches and regional processing centers nationwide 
during  the regional processing centers handled of the division s total loan volume 
like the consumer markets division  the wholesale lending division has focused on improving its sales efforts 
the division has created specialized sales units that cater to the individual segments of the wholesale market eg  large regional and national brokers 
in addition  the wholesale lending division continued to make improvements in its business partner website cwbc  which was utilized by its business partners in of the loans produced by the division in to improve efficiency and quality control  the division centralized processing of its subprime loans in during  the correspondent lending division added significant capacity by adding temporary staff  moving to multiple shifts  implementing accelerated training classes and increasing the use of electronic data interfaces with customers 
this strategy allows the division to quickly adjust to changes in the origination market 
loan servicing sector the loan servicing sector reflects the performance of the company s investments in msrs and other retained interests and associated risk management activities  as well as profits from subservicing activities in the united states 
the loan servicing sector incorporates a significant processing operation  consisting of approximately  employees that service the company s million mortgage customers 
how effectively this servicing operation manages costs and generates ancillary income from the portfolio has a significant impact on the long term performance of this sector 
the following table summarizes the loan servicing sector pre tax loss year ended year ended december  november  amount percentage of amount percentage of average average servicing dollar amounts in thousands portfolio servicing portfolio revenues  servicing hedge gains  amortization  impairment  operating expense  interest expense  net  pre tax loss  average servicing portfolio  the loan servicing sector experienced significant losses during this was expected  given the increasing level of refinance activity that was driven by mortgage rates that reached forty year lows 
the company s msrs and other retained interests represent the present value of cash flow streams that are closely linked to the expected life of the underlying servicing portfolio 
the continued high level of actual and forecasted prepayment activity reduced the life of the servicing portfolio and thus the value of the company s related investments  as reflected by the combined impairment and amortization charge of billion incurred in the servicing hedge generated a gain of billion during the period  which partially offset the combined impairment and amortization charge 
amortization and impairment  net of the servicing hedge  was billion for  an increase of billion over in a stable interest rate environment  management would expect no significant impairment and would expect to incur expenses related to the servicing hedge driven primarily by the composition of the hedge  the shape of the yield curve and the level of interest rate volatility 
during  the company securitized a portion of its net servicing fees excess servicing 
proceeds from the sale of these securities amounted to million 
management believes such securitizations enable the company to improve the overall returns on its msr investment and more efficiently manage its capital 
despite the level of prepayments  the company increased its servicing portfolio to billion at december   representing a increase compared to november  loan closing services sector this sector is comprised of the landsafe companies that provide credit reports  flood determinations  appraisals  property valuation services  title reports and home inspections primarily to the loan production sector but increasingly to third parties as well 
the company s integration of these previously outsourced services has provided not only incremental profits but also increased overall levels of service and quality control 
the landsafe companies produced million in pre tax earnings in  representing a increase over the increase in landsafe s contribution to pre tax earnings was primarily due to a increase in the volume of closing services provided  which resulted from the increase in loan origination activity in the loan production sector 
growth in revenues resulting from this increase in activity was partially offset by price reductions and by the discontinuation of landsafe s northern california title operations 
during  of landsafe s revenues were from third parties  as compared to during management believes that this percentage should continue to rise in the future 
the following table shows the number of units processed during the respective periods year ended year ended in units december  november  credit reports  automated property valuation services  flood determinations  appraisals  other  total  non mortgage banking businesses to leverage the company s mortgage banking platform  as well as to reduce the variability of earnings caused by changes in mortgage interest rates  the company has expanded into non mortgage banking businesses 
the company s other business segments include capital markets  insurance  banking and global operations 
pre tax earnings from these other businesses increased million  or  to million in compared to insurance segment segment pre tax earnings decreased from the year ago period  to million  primarily due a significant reduction in balboa life and casualty s pre tax earnings that was largely offset by growth in balboa reinsurance s pre tax earnings 
following are the pre tax earnings by business line year ended year ended dollar amounts in thousands december  n ovember  carrier operations balboa life and casualty  balboa reinsurance company  agency operations parent expenses  the company s mortgage reinsurance business produced million in pre tax earnings  a increase in comparison to  driven by a increase in net earned premiums 
the increase in net earned premiums resulted from a increase in the number of policies in force that was driven by growth in the company s loan servicing portfolio  coupled with an overall increase in the ceded premium percentage 
the company s life and casualty insurance business produced pre tax earnings of million  a decrease of million  or compared to the decline in earnings in was due to lower investment portfolio income and higher than expected claims costs related to certain homeowners reinsurance contracts that were subsequently terminated 
additional reserves also were booked related to certain other lender placed insurance contracts due to observed losses higher than expectations 
these lender placed insurance contracts were subsequently favorably renegotiated 
these amounts were partially offset by a million  or  increase in premiums earned during compared to balboa life and casualty s overall loss ratio was and in and  respectively 
the agency was restructured in the fourth quarter to streamline its operations and focus on profitable activities 
management believes that the actions taken properly position the carrier and the agency to resume their growth in profitability 
both the carrier and agency operations showed significant growth in total policies in force in comparison to the comparable period a year ago 
following are the policies in force for each business line as of the respective dates listed in the table below amounts in units december  november  carrier operations balboa life and casualty  balboa reinsurance company  agency operations  the increase in life and casualty policies is attributable to lender placed property hazard and voluntary homeowners product lines 
the growth in voluntary insurance was achieved through sales to the company s mortgage customer base through cis as well as through increased third party business 
in terms of premiums  approximately of balboa life and casualty s net earned premiums in were from voluntary homeowners policies  the balance of the net earned premiums was attributable to lender placed insurance 
balboa manages its insurance risk by reinsuring portions of its insured risk 
balboa seeks to earn profits by capitalizing on the company s customer base and its institutional relationships  as well as through operating efficiencies and sound underwriting 
balboa reinsurance historically has not realized insurance losses  owing to a generally strong economy  an even stronger housing market and the age of the underlying insured loans 
during the year  the company revised its reinsurance contracts  to provide additional coverage in exchange for additional ceded premiums 
management expects balboa reinsurance to incur insurance losses in the future as the underlying insured loans season 
capital markets segment the capital markets segment achieved pre tax earnings of million for  an increase of million  or compared to total revenues were million  an increase of million  or compared to total securities trading volume increased to trillion 
this performance was largely driven by a highly favorable operating environment consisting of a robust mortgage backed securities market  high mortgage securities price volatility and low short term financing costs 
the following table shows pre tax earnings by company year ended year ended dollar amounts in thousands december  november  countrywide securities corporation  countrywide asset management corporation  includes cse  ccmi and ccm  inc the following table shows the composition of csc s trading volume  which includes trades with the mortgage banking segment  by instrument year ended y ear ended dollar amounts in millions december  nove mber  mortgage backed securities  government agency debt  asset backed securities  other  csc has successfully increased its share of the mortgage backed securities market as evidenced by its league table rankings 
most notably  csc was ranked fourth in underwriting non agency mbs in  up from seventh in source inside mbs and abs 
the increase in market share is the result of increased sales penetration achieved through the expansion of the sales force  an increase in trading personnel  the effective use of market and product research to attract institutional customers and an increase in mortgage conduit activities during approximately of the total trade volume was with chl in approximately million  or  of the segment s revenues during resulted from its mortgage conduit activities 
these activities generally involve brokering and securitizing prime  subprime and re performing mortgage loans 
management anticipates that the capital market segment s revenues and earnings likely will fall from the record levels achieved in as the highly favorable market conditions that existed in abate 
global operations segment for  the global operations segment s pre tax earnings totaled million  representing an increase of million in comparison to results in the current period were positively impacted by the recognition of higher technology licensing fees related to ghl s increased processing volumes for both originations and servicing 
in the fourth quarter of  global home loans limited ghl finalized an agreement with the barclays  plc  its joint venture partner  to provide origination processing  subservicing and delinquent servicing 
ghl expanded its total volume of loans subserviced in the uk to over billion  or over million mortgage loans

year ended year ended dollar amounts in thousands december  november  treasury bank bank  countrywide warehouse lending cwl  treasury bank was acquired in may the bank produced pre tax earnings of million for the overall increase was primarily due to an increase in net interest income arising from growth in average earning assets and approximately million in profits resulting from document custodian services provided to the company s mortgage banking operation 
average earning assets increased to billion for  an increase of billion in comparison to asset growth was funded primarily by the transfer of mortgagor and investor impound accounts controlled by chl from third party banks to the bank  a capital contribution from countrywide financial corporation  federal home loan bank advances and growth in the bank s retail deposit base

the composition of the bank s assets was as follows dollar amounts in thousands december  november  cash short term investments loans receivable  net  investment securities classified as available for sale  other assets total  the bank plans to increase assets to billion by the end of the assets will be primarily mortgage loans sourced through the company s mortgage banking operation 
likewise  a significant portion of the bank s liabilities will come from the mortgage banking operation in the form of impound accounts 
as a result of these synergies  management is confident about achieving the bank s growth targets 
the bank s strategy entails holding loans in portfolio that historically would have been immediately securitized and sold in the secondary mortgage market 
management believes this strategy will increase earnings  as well as provide more stable earnings  over the long term  although in the short term  reported profits will be impacted by the reduction in gains otherwise recognizable at time of sale 
the extent to which the bank generates long term incremental profits on a consolidated basis will depend largely on how the bank s overall cost of funds compare to the funding costs implicit in securitization 
cwl s pre tax earnings increased by million during in comparison to primarily due to the growth in average outstanding mortgage warehouse advances partially offset by a decline in the average net spread from during to during for  average mortgage warehouse advances outstanding were billion  an increase of billion in comparison to detailed discussion of consolidated statement of earnings gain on sale of loans and securities is summarized below for and year ended year ended december  november  percentage of lo ans percentage of loans dollar amounts in thousands dollars sold dollars sold mortgage banking prime first mortgages  subprime mortgages  prime home equity mortgages  capital markets  other gain on sale of loans and securities increased in primarily due to higher production and sales volume and higher margins on prime first mortgages 
margins on subprime and prime home equity mortgages declined primarily due to a change in origination channel mix 
a larger percentage of these mortgages were produced by wld and cld  these divisions traditionally have lower margins than the company s retail channels 
margins on prime first mortgages were high in both and on a relative historical basis  due largely to the very favorable mortgage market environment that prevailed during those years 
that market was characterized by record consumer demand for mortgages and modest price competition by historical industry standards 
management expects margins  particularly on prime first mortgages  to decline in the future as the level of mortgage originations subsides 
the reduction in capital markets gain on sale of securities was largely due to the impact of the steepening yield curve on the mix of its revenues 
capital markets revenues from its trading activities consist of gains on the sale of securities and net interest income 
in a very steep yield curve environment  trading revenues will derive largely or entirely from net interest income earned during the securities holding period 
as the yield curve flattens  the mix of revenues will shift toward gain on sale of securities 
in general  gain on sale of loans and securities is affected by numerous factors including the volume and mix of loans sold  production channel mix  the level of price competition and the slope of the yield curve 
net interest income is summarized below for the periods ended and year ended year ended dollar amounts in thousands december  november  net interest income mortgage loans and securities held for sale  capital markets securities trading portfolio  servicing sector interest expense  re performing fha and va loans  banking segment loans and securities  custodial balances  insurance segment investments  other  net interest income  the increase in net interest income from mortgage loans and securities held for sale reflects the growth in mortgage production combined with a higher overall net earnings rate due to a steeper yield curve during the company finances the major portion of its mortgage loans and securities held for sale at prevailing short term borrowing rates  which declined relative to the rate earned on the loans and securities when compared to the year ago period 
the increase in net interest income from the capital markets securities trading portfolio is attributable to a increase in the average inventory of securities held coupled with an increase in the average net spread earned from in to in the increase in the average net spread is the result of a steeper yield curve as discussed above 
re performing fha and va loans are reinstated loans that had previously defaulted and were consequently re purchased from mortgage securities issued by the company or others 
such loans are subsequently securitized and re sold 
the increase in interest income related to this activity is a result of an increase in the volume of such loans purchased during interest expense in the loan servicing sector decreased due to a decline in short term rates a portion of the company s long term debt is variable rate  partially offset by an increase in the assets financed 
the increase in net interest income from the banking segment was largely attributable to year over year asset growth both in treasury bank and in the company s warehouse lending activities 
average assets in the banking segment increased to billion in  an increase of billion 
the increase in assets was partially offset by a decline in the average net spread from in the twelve months ended november  to in net interest income from custodial balances decreased due to a decline in the earnings rate  which is tied to short term rates  from in to in the decrease in the earnings rate was partially offset by a billion  or  increase in the average custodial balances resulting from a larger portfolio and higher loan payoffs 
custodial balances rise as loan payoffs increase because the company holds the payoff funds for periods ranging from two to calendar days  depending upon the payoff date and the investor servicing agreement

comparison of results of operations for ten months ended december  audited to the ten months ended december  unaudited consolidated earnings performance the company s diluted earnings per share for the ten months ended december  was 
net earnings increased from the ten month period ended december  this record earnings performance was driven principally by the record level of mortgage loans produced by the company billion as compared to billion for the ten months ended december  industry wide  mortgage originations exceeded trillion in calendar driven by record levels of refinance and housing activity in the united states 
this historic level of activity was stimulated by mortgage rates that reached forty year lows 
the level of housing activity that resulted in almost trillion in purchase mortgages is particularly noteworthy given the relative weakness in the overall national economy in the demand for mortgages produced both record volumes and production margins 
the combination of record volumes and record margins increased loan production pre tax earnings to million for the ten month period  an increase of million from the ten months ended december  the company significantly increased the number of sales and processing staff in its loan production divisions to cope with the increased demand 
as volumes moderate  the incremental processing staff which includes a substantial number of temporary employees will be reduced 
however  the company plans to continue building its sales staff despite any potential drop in loan origination volume as a key component of its purchase market share growth initiative 
the company experienced substantial repayments from its servicing portfolio during this  coupled with the expectation of continued higher than normal runoff as of year end  resulted in significant amortization and impairment of the company s msrs and other retained interests  net of hedge gains  for the ten months ended december  the combined amortization and impairment of msrs and other retained interests  net of hedge gain s  increased million over the amount recorded for the ten months ended december  on a combined basis  the mortgage banking segment generated pre tax earnings of million  an increase of in comparison to the ten months ended december  the company s non mortgage banking businesses were also significant contributors to the period s earnings performance 
in particular  the capital markets segment had pre tax earnings of million  in comparison to million for the period ended december  this segment was also a beneficiary of the robust activity in the mortgage backed securities market  as well as the favorable yield curve

ten month s ended december  dollar amounts in thousands percent of l oan percent of loan dollars volume dollars volume revenues  expenses  pre tax earnings  record demand for mortgages enabled the loan production sector to achieve record profit margins pre tax earnings as a percentage of loan volume 
the loan production sector was capacity constrained and price ie  points and fees charged were used to regulate the volume 
the sector operated on average at of planned operation capacity for the period  which reduced per unit costs 
because of the level of demand  the loan production sector scaled back its marketing expenses 
the following table shows total loan volume by division mortgage banking loan production ten months ended december  dollar amounts in millions correspondent lending division  wholesale lending division  consumer markets division  full spectrum lending  inc  the overall increase in loan production volume was driven largely by refinances  although notably purchase money loans increased 
the increase in purchase money loans is significant as this is the stable growth component of the mortgage market refinances are driven largely by prevailing mortgage rates 
all divisions contributed to the increase in purchase money loans 
the following table summarizes loan production by purpose and by interest rate type mortgage banking loan production ten months ended dollar amounts in millions december  purpose purchase   non purchase   interest rate type fixed rate   adjustable rate   also noteworthy was the volume of prime home equity and subprime mortgages produced during the current period which increased in comparison to the ten months ended december  the following table summarizes this production mortgage banking prime home equity and subprime mortgage dollar amounts in millions ten months ended december  subprime   prime home equity   prime home equity and subprime mortgages carry higher profit margins historically and the demand for such mortgages is believed to be less rate sensitive than the demand for prime first mortgage loans 
the company successfully retained a significant percentage of the customers who prepaid their mortgage during the period 
the overall retention rate was  for retail customers the rate was 
notably  of the consumer market division s total loan production during the period was sourced from the company s servicing portfolio 
the high retention rates during the most recent period were due  in part  to the high level of refinances 
the company has been most successful in retaining customers who refinance their existing mortgage in such an environment 
during the ten months ended december   of the consumer markets division s refinance loan volume was from existing mortgage customers 
this synergy is a major source of intrinsic value derived from the company s msr investment 
the consumer markets division also successfully grew its commissioned sales force during the period  ending the year with  salespeople on staff 
the increased sales capacity was a major reason for the growth in purchase money loans 
at december   the company held billion of recently produced prime home equity mortgage loans in inventory 
had the company securitized and sold these loans on that date  the production sector would have recognized an additional gain on sale of approximately million 
the company elected to defer the sale of these loans because of its available financing capacity  improved overall economics and the planned transfer of a portion of the loans to treasury bank as a portfolio investment 
during the ten months ended december   the loan production sector operated at approximately of planned operational capacity 
the primary capacity constraint in the company s loan origination activities is the number of loan operations personnel it has on staff 
therefore  the company measures planned capacity with reference to the number of loan operations personnel it has on staff multiplied by the number of loans it expects each available loan operations staff person to process under normal conditions 
the company continued to increase the number of sales and operations staff in its loan production divisions to cope with the ongoing demand 
when volumes moderate  the operations staff including a significant number of temporary employees will be reduced 
however  the company plans to continue building its sales staff despite any potential drop in loan origination volume as a primary means to grow market share 
the following table summarizes the loan production sector workforce workforce at december  sales  operations regular employees  temporary staff  production technology administrative and support loan servicing sector the loan servicing sector reflects the performance of the company s investments in msrs and other retained interests  as well as profits from sub servicing activities in the united states 
at december   the loan servicing sector employed approximately  employees that service the company s million mortgage customers 
how effectively this servicing operation manages costs and generates ancillary income from the loan servicing portfolio has a significant impact on the long term performance of this sector 
the following table summarizes loan servicing sector pre tax earnings ten months en ded december  dollar percentage of dollar percentage of average average servicing dollar amounts in thousands portfolio servicing portfolio revenues  servicing hedge gains  amortization  impairment  operating expense  interest expense  net  pre tax expense  average servicing portfolio  annualized the loan servicing sector experienced losses during the period ended december  this was not unexpected given the level of refinance activity that prevailed during the period 
the company s msrs and other retained interests represent the present value of cash flow streams that are closely linked to the life of the underlying servicing portfolio 
the substantial increase in actual and forecasted prepayment activity reduced the life of the servicing portfolio and thus the value of the company s related investments  as reflected by the combined impairment and amortization charge of billion incurred in the period 
the msr impairment charge was partially offset by a servicing hedge gain of billion 
the amortization and impairment  net of the servicing hedge  of billion for the period is in tandem with the high level of profits generated by the loan production sector 
despite the level of prepayments  the company was able to increase its servicing portfolio to billion at december   an increase from the prior year 
at the same time  the overall weighted average note rate was reduced from to 
loan closing services sector the landsafe companies produced million in pre tax earnings  a increase over the year ago period 
this increase was in line with the company s growth in loan production

the growth in voluntary insurance was achieved through penetration of the company s mortgage customer base through countrywide insurance services  inc during the period ended december   balboa underwrote approximately of the policies placed by countrywide insurance services  inc balboa reinsurance s increase in premiums was due to growth in the company s servicing portfolio  as well as to increased reinsurance coverage provided to various mortgage insurance companies on existing policies 
both the carrier and agency operations showed significant growth in total policies in force in comparison to the prior period 
following are the policies in force for each business line as of the respective dates december  amounts in units carrier operations balboa life and casualty  balboa reinsurance company  agency operations  the increase in life and casualty policies is attributable to lender placed property hazard and voluntary homeowners product lines 
the growth in voluntary insurance was achieved through sales to the company s mortgage customer base through countrywide insurance services  inc  as well as through increased third party business 
insurance claims expenses incurred by balboa life and casualty grew in line with the increase in net earned premiums 
balboa manages its insurance risk through the purchase of reinsurance 
balboa seeks to earn profits by capitalizing on the company s customer base and its institutional relationships  as well as through operating efficiencies and sound underwriting 
balboa reinsurance historically has not experienced insurance losses  owing to a strong economy and to an even stronger housing market 
during the year the company revised its reinsurance contracts  in essence providing additional coverage in exchange for additional ceded premiums 
consequently  management expects balboa reinsurance to incur insurance losses in the future  although absent a significant housing recession management believes balboa reinsurance s profits will continue to rise in tandem with the servicing portfolio 
capital markets segment the capital markets segment ccm achieved record earnings of million for the ten month period  a increase from the ten month period ended december  ccm capitalized on the robust mortgage backed securities market  price volatility and low short term interest rates that prevailed during the period

the reduction in capital markets gain on sale of securities was largely due to the impact of the steepening yield curve on the mix of its revenues 
capital markets revenues from its trading activities consist of gains on the sale of securities and net interest income 
in a very steep yield curve environment  trading revenues will derive largely or entirely from net interest income earned during the securities holding period 
as the yield curve flattens  the mix of revenues will shift toward gain on sale of securities 
in general  gain on sale of loans and securities is affected by numerous factors including the volume and mix of loans produced and sold  production channel mix  the level of price competition and the slope of the yield curve 
net interest income is summarized below for the ten months ended december  and ten month s ended december  dollar amounts in thousands net interest income mortgage loan and securities held for sale  capital markets securities trading portfolio  servicing sector interest expense  re performing fha and va loans  banking segment loans and securities  insurance segment investments  custodial balance benefit  other  net interest income expense  the increase in net interest income from mortgage loans and securities held for sale reflects the growth in mortgage production combined with a higher overall net earnings rate due to a steeper yield curve  during the ten months ended december  in comparison to the ten months ended december  the company finances the major portion of its mortgage loans and securities held for sale at prevailing short term borrowing rates  which declined relative to the rate earned on the loans and securities when compared to the year ago period 
net interest income earned in the capital markets segment is primarily related to its trading portfolio 
the increase is attributable to an increase in the volume of securities traded coupled with the affect of a steeper yield curve as discussed above 
interest expense in the loan servicing sector decreased due to a decline in short term rates a portion of the company s long term debt is variable rate  partially offset by an increase in the assets financed 
re performing fha and va loans are reinstated loans that had previously defaulted and were consequently re purchased from mortgage securities issued by the company or others 
such loans are subsequently securitized and re sold 
the increase in interest income related to this activity is a result of an increase in the volume of such loan purchased 
the increase in net interest income from the banking segment was largely attributable to year over year asset growth both  in treasury bank and in the company s warehouse lending activities 
net interest income from custodial balances decreased due to a decline in the earnings rate  which is tied to short term rates  partially offset by higher average custodial balances resulting from a larger portfolio and higher loan payoffs 
net interest income from custodial balances decreased also as a result of the general requirement of loan servicers to pass through interest on paid off loans at the underlying security rates  which were significantly higher than the short term rates earned by the company 
this reduced net interest income from custodial balances by million and million in the ten months ended december  and  respectively

higher prepayment penalties in the ten months ended december  correspond to the increase in loan payoffs during that period

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary market risk facing the company is interest rate risk 
from an enterprise perspective  the company manages this risk through the natural counterbalance of its loan production and servicing businesses 
the company also uses various financial instruments  including derivatives  to manage the interest rate risk related specifically to its committed pipeline  mortgage loan inventory and mbs held for sale  msrs  trading securities and other retained interests as well as a portion of its debt 
the overall objective of the company s interest rate risk management activities is to reduce the variability of reported earnings caused by changes in interest rates 
committed pipeline and mortgage inventory the company s loan production consists primarily of fixed rate mortgages 
fixed rate mortgages  like other fixed rate debt instruments  are subject to a loss in value when market interest rates rise 
the company is exposed to such losses from the time an interest rate lock commitment irlc is made to an applicant or financial intermediary to the time the related mortgage loan is sold 
to manage this risk of loss  the company utilizes derivatives  primarily forward sales of mbs and options to buy and sell mbs  as well as options on treasury futures contracts 
the company ensures that substantially all fixed rate mortgage loan inventory is covered at all times by net forward sales of mbs 
the net forward sales may be comprised of forward sales of mbs partially offset by forward purchases of mbs 
the committed pipeline consists of loan applications in process where the company has issued irlcs to the applicants or financial intermediaries 
the interest rate risk management of the committed pipeline is complicated by the fact that the ultimate percentage of applications that close within the terms of the irlc is variable 
the primary factor that drives the variability of the closing percentage is changes in mortgage rates 
in general  the percentage of applications in the committed pipeline that ultimately close within the terms of the irlc increases if mortgage rates rise and decreases if mortgage rates fall 
this is due primarily to the relative attractiveness of current mortgage rates compared to the applicants committed rates 
the closing percentage is also influenced by the source of the applications  age of the applications  purpose for the loans purchase or refinance and the application approval rate 
the company has developed closing ratio estimates fallout curves for the committed pipeline using its empirical data taking into account all of these variables 
the fallout curves also take into account renegotiations of rate and point commitments that tend to occur when mortgage rates fall 
the fallout curves are revised periodically using the most current empirical data 
to manage the interest rate risk associated with the committed pipeline  the company uses a combination of net forward sales of mbs and put and call options on mbs or treasury futures 
as a general rule  the company enters into forward sales of mbs in an amount equal to the portion of the committed pipeline expected to close  assuming no change in mortgage rates 
the company acquires put and call options to protect against the variability of loan closings caused by changes in mortgage rates  utilizing the current fallout curves to determine the amount of optional coverage required 
the company reviews its committed pipeline and mortgage inventory risk profiles on a daily basis 
the company uses the following derivative instruments in its risk management activities related to the committed pipeline and mortgage loan inventory forward sales of mbs represents an obligation to sell a mbs at a specific price in the future  therefore  its value increases as mortgage rates rise 
forward purchases of mbs represents an obligation to buy a mbs at a specific price in the future  therefore  its value increases as mortgage rates fall 
long call options on mbs represents a right to buy a mbs at a specific price in the future  therefore  its value increases as mortgage rates fall 
long put options on mbs represents a right to sell a mbs at a specific price in the future  therefore  its value increases as mortgage rates rise 
long call options on treasury futures represents a right to acquire a treasury futures contract at a specific price in the future  therefore  its value increases as the benchmark treasury rate falls 
long put options on treasury futures represents a right to sell a treasury futures contract at a specific price in the future  therefore  its value increases as the benchmark treasury rate rises 
short eurodollar futures contracts represents standardized exchange traded contract  the value of which is tied to spot eurodollar rates at specified future dates  therefore  its value increases when eurodollar rates rise 
mortgage servicing rights msrs and other retained interests the msrs and other retained interests  specifically interest only securities and residual securities  are generally subject to loss in value when mortgage rates decline 
declining mortgage rates generally precipitate increased consumer refinancing activity 
increased refinancing activity reduces the life of the loans underlying the msrs and other retained interests  thereby reducing their value 
reductions in the value of these assets impact earnings through impairment charges 
to moderate the effect on earnings of impairment  the company maintains a portfolio of financial instruments  including derivative  which increase in aggregate value when interest rates decline the servicing hedge 
the company currently uses the following financial instruments in its servicing hedge interest rate floors represents a right to receive cash if a reference interest rate falls below a contractual strike rate  therefore  its value increases as reference interest rates fall 
the reference interest rates used in the company s interest rate floors include mortgage rates  treasury rates and us dollar usd libor 
long call options on treasury futures represents a right to acquire a treasury futures contract at a specific price in the future  therefore  its value increases as the benchmark treasury rate falls 
long put options on treasury futures represents a right to sell a treasury futures contract at a specific price in the future  therefore  its value increases as the benchmark treasury rate rises 
long put options on eurodollar futures represents a right to sell an eurodollar future at a specific price in the future  therefore  its value increases as the benchmark eurodollar rate rises 
long call options on mbs represents a right to buy an mbs at a specific price in the future  therefore  its value increases as mortgage rates fall 
interest rate swaps represents a mutual agreement to exchange interest rate payments  one party paying a fixed rate and another paying a floating rate tied to a reference interest rate eg  usd libor 
for use in the servicing hedge  the company receives the fixed rate and pays the floating rate  therefore  the contract increases in value as rates fall 
receiver swaptions represents a right to enter into a predetermined interest rate swap at a future date in which  upon exercise of its right  the company receives the fixed rate and pays the floating rate  therefore  the contract increases in value as rates fall 
payor swaptions represents a right to enter into a predetermined interest rate swap at a future date in which  upon exercise of its right  the company pays the fixed rate and receives the floating rate  therefore  the contract increases in value as rates rise 
principal only securities consist of mortgage trust principal only securities and treasury principal only securities strips 
these securities have been purchased at discounts to their par value 
as interest rates decrease  the values of these securities generally increase 
these instruments are used in tandem to manage the overall risk profile of the msrs and other retained interests 
the company reviews its retained interests risk profile on a daily basis 
trading activities in connection with its capital markets activities  the company maintains a trading portfolio of fixed income securities  primarily mbs 
the company is exposed to price changes in its trading portfolio arising from interest rate changes during the period it holds the securities 
to manage this risk  the company utilizes the following derivative instruments forward sales of to be announced tba mbs represents an obligation to sell agency pass through mbs that has not yet been issued at a specific price and at a specific date in the future  therefore  its value increases as mortgage rates rise 
forward purchases of tba mbs represents an obligation to purchase agency pass through mbs that have not yet been issued at a specific price at a specific date in the future  therefore  its value increases as mortgage rates fall 
forward sale of us treasury securities represents a standardized exchange traded agreement to sell a specific quantity of us treasury securities for a specific price at a specific date in the future  therefore  its value increases when interest rates rise 
short fed funds and eurodollar futures contracts represents a standardized exchange traded contract  the value of which is tied to spot fed funds or eurodollar rates at specified future dates 
the value of these contracts increases when fed funds or eurodollar rates rise 
interest rate swaps represents a mutual agreement to exchange interest rate payments  one party paying a fixed rate and another paying a floating rate tied to a reference interest rate eg usd libor 
for use in its trading portfolio risk management activities  the company generally receives the floating rate and pays the fixed rate  therefore  its value generally increases in value as rates rise 
total return swaps represents a contract between counterparties to receive or pay the change in value of a specified index over a specified period of time 
the indices referenced in total return swaps used by the company in its hedging of trading securities generally encompass price changes  coupon interest payments and principal pay downs of a specified group of securities 
in its trading portfolio risk management activities  the company generally pays the change in the referenced indices if the indices rise and receives the change in the referenced indices if the indices decline  therefore  the value of these contracts generally increases as rates rise 
debt securities the company determines the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt as part of its overall interest rate risk management activities 
the company uses interest rate swaps to efficiently and cost effectively achieve its desired mix of debt 
typically terms of the interest rate swaps match the terms of the underlying debt  resulting in an effective conversion of the debt rate 
impact of changes in interest rates on the net value of the company s interest rate sensitive financial instruments the company performs various sensitivity analyses that quantify the net financial impact of changes in interest rates on its interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments 
these analyses incorporate assumed changes in the interest rate environment including selected hypothetical instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve 
various modeling techniques are employed to value the financial instruments in connection with these sensitivity analyses 
for mortgage loans  mbs  mbs forward contracts  collateralized mortgage obligations and msrs  an option adjusted spread oas model is used 
the primary assumptions used in this model for purpose of these sensitivity analyses are the implied market volatility of interest rates and prepayment speeds 
for options and interest rate floors  an option pricing model is used 
the primary assumption used in this model is implied market volatility of interest rates 
other retained interests are valued using zero volatility discounted cash flow models incorporating all relevant cash flows associated with these instruments 
the primary assumptions used in these models are prepayment rates  discount rates and credit losses 
as of december   the company estimated that an immediate decline of and in mortgage rates and long term swap rates  respectively  coupled with a increase in short term interest rates would result in a million net decline in the fair value of its msrs and other financial instruments and a million net decline in the fair value of its trading securities 
the components of the estimated net decline in fair value of the company s msrs and other financial instruments are as follows dollar amounts are in millions c hange in value retained interests impact of servicing hedge mortgage based swap based treasury based retained interests  net committed pipeline mortgage loan inventory impact of associated derivative instruments mortgage based treasury based committed pipeline and mortgage loan inventory  net notes payable and capital securities impact of associated derivative instruments swap based notes payable and capital securities  net mortgage loans held for investment insurance and banking investment portfolios deposit liabilities net loss in fair value related to msrs and other financial instruments management estimated that an immediate decline of and in mortgage rates and long term swap rates  respectively  coupled with a increase in short term in interest rates is the largest such change in interest rates that could reasonably occur and results in the largest such loss as of december  as of december   the same change in rates would result in an million net decline in fair value of its msrs and other financial instruments and a million net decline in fair value related to its trading securities 
these sensitivity analyses are limited by the fact that they were performed at a particular point in time  are subject to the accuracy of various assumptions used  including prepayment forecasts and discount rates and do not incorporate other factors that would impact the company s overall financial performance in such scenarios 
in addition  not all of the changes in fair value would impact current period earnings 
consequently  the preceding estimates should not be viewed as an earnings forecast 
foreign currency risk an additional  albeit less significant  market risk facing the company is foreign currency risk 
the company has issued foreign currency denominated medium term notes 
the company manages the foreign currency risk associated with such medium term notes through currency swap transactions 
the terms of the currency swaps effectively translate the foreign currency denominated medium term notes into united states dollars  thereby eliminating the associated foreign currency risk subject to the performance of the various counterparties to the currency swaps 
as a result  potential changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies denominating such medium term notes would not have a net financial impact on future earnings  fair values or cash flows 
credit risk securitization substantially all mortgage loans originated by the company are securitized and sold into the secondary mortgage market 
as described below  the degree to which credit risk on the underlying loans is transferred through the securitization process depends on the structure of the securitization 
the company s prime  first mortgage loans generally are securitized on a non recourse basis  while its prime home equity and subprime mortgage loans generally are securitized with limited recourse for credit losses 
conforming conventional prime loans conforming conventional loans are generally pooled into mortgage backed securities guaranteed by fannie mae or freddie mac 
a small portion of these loans also have been sold to the federal home loan bank  through its mortgage partnership finance program 
subject to certain representations and warranties on the part of the company  substantially all conventional loans securitized through fannie mae or freddie mac are sold on a non recourse basis 
accordingly  credit losses are generally absorbed by fannie mae and freddie mac and not the company 
the company pays guarantee fees to fannie mae and freddie mac on loans it securitizes through these agencies 
those fees include compensation to the respective agencies for their assumption of credit risk 
fha insured and va guaranteed loans fha insured and va guaranteed mortgage loans are generally pooled into mortgage backed securities guaranteed by the government national mortgage association ginnie mae 
a small portion of these loans have been sold to the federal home loan bank  through its mortgage partnership finance program 
the company is insured against foreclosure loss by the fha or partially guaranteed against foreclosure loss by the va 
fees charged by the fha and va for assuming such risks are paid directly by the mortgagors 
the company is exposed to credit losses on defaulted va loans to the extent that the partial guarantee provided by the va is inadequate to cover the total credit losses incurred 
the company pays guarantee fees to ginnie mae for ginnie mae s guarantee on its securities of timely payment of principal and interest 
ginnie mae does not assume mortgage credit risk associated with the loans securitized under its program 
non conforming conventional prime loans non conforming conventional prime mortgage loans are generally pooled into private label non agency mortgage backed securities 
such securitizations involve some form of credit enhancement  such as senior subordinated structures or mortgage pool insurance 
securitizations that involve senior subordinated structures contain securities that assume varying levels of credit risk 
holders of subordinated securities are compensated for the credit risk assumed through a higher yield 
the company generally sells the subordinated securities created in connection with these securitizations and thereby transfers the related credit loss exposure  other than as described below with respect to representations and warranties made with respect to the securitized loans 
prime home equity loans prime home equity loans are generally pooled into private label asset backed securities 
these securities generally are credit enhanced through over collateralization and guarantees provided by a third party surety 
in such securitizations  the company is subject to limited recourse for credit losses through retention of a residual interest 
subprime loans subprime loans generally are pooled into private label mortgage backed securities 
the company generally securitizes these loans with limited recourse for credit losses 
such limited recourse securitizations generally have contained mortgage pool insurance as the primary form of credit enhancement  coupled with a limited corporate guarantee provided by the company and or a retained residual interest 
when mortgage pool insurance is used  the associated premiums are paid directly by the company 
the company also has pooled a portion of its subprime loans into securities guaranteed by fannie mae 
in such cases  the company has paid fannie mae a guarantee fee in exchange for fannie mae assuming the credit risk of the underlying loans 
in addition  the company has securitized a portion of its subprime loans on a limited recourse basis through the retention of a residual interest without the use of mortgage pool insurance 
while the company generally securitizes its prime  first mortgage loans on a non recourse basis  it does have potential liability under the representations and warranties it makes to purchasers and insurers of the loans 
in the event of a breach of such representations and warranties  the company may be required to either repurchase the subject mortgage loans or indemnify the investor or insurer 
in such cases  any subsequent credit loss on the mortgage loans is borne by the company 
the company s exposure to credit losses related to its limited recourse securitization activities is limited to the carrying value of its subordinated interests and to the contractual limit of reimbursable losses under its corporate guarantees less the recorded liability for such guarantees 
these amounts at december  are as follows december  dollar amounts in thousands subordinated interests prime home equity residual securities  prime home equity transferors interests  subprime residual securities  corporate guarantees in excess of recorded reserves  the carrying value of the residual securities is net of expected future credit losses 
related to the company s non recourse and limited recourse securitization activities  the total credit losses incurred for and are summarized as follows year twelve months ended ended d ecember  november  dollar amounts in thousands subprime securitizations with retained residual interest subprime securitizations with corporate guarantee repurchased or indemnified loans prime home equity securitizations with retained residual interest prime home equity securitizations with corporate guarantee va losses in excess of va guarantee mortgage reinsurance the company provides mortgage reinsurance through contracts with several primary mortgage insurance companies on mortgage loans included in the company s servicing portfolio 
under these contracts  the company absorbs mortgage insurance losses in excess of a specified percentage of the principal balance of a given pool of loans  subject to a cap  in exchange for a portion of the pools mortgage insurance premium 
approximately billion of mortgage loans in the company s servicing portfolio are covered by such mortgage reinsurance contracts 
the reinsurance contracts place limits on the company s maximum exposure to losses 
at december   the maximum aggregate losses under the reinsurance contracts was million 
the company is required to pledge securities to cover this potential liability 
the company recognized losses related to this activity of million in mortgage loans held for sale at december   mortgage loans held for sale amounted to billion 
while the loans are in inventory  the company bears credit risk after taking into consideration primary mortgage insurance which is generally required for conventional loans with a loan to value ratio greater than  fha insurance or va guarantees 
historically  credit losses related to loans held for sale have not been significant 
portfolio lending activities the company also holds a portfolio of mortgage warehouse advances and mortgage loans held for investment  primarily in its banking segment  which amounted to billion at december  the company incurred no credit losses from these activities in counterparty risk the company has exposure to credit loss in the event of non performance by its trading counterparties and counterparties to its various over the counter derivative financial instruments 
the company manages this credit risk by selecting only well established  financially strong counterparties  spreading the credit risk among many such counterparties and by placing contractual limits on the amount of unsecured credit risk from any single counterparty 
the aggregate amount of counterparty credit exposure at december   before and after collateral held by the company  was as follows dollar amounts in millions aggregate credit exposure before collateral held  less collateral held  net aggregate unsecured credit exposure loan servicing the following table sets forth certain information regarding the company s servicing portfolio of single family mortgage loans  including loans and securities held for sale and loans subserviced for others  for the periods indicated

expressed as a percentage of the total number of loans serviced excluding subserviced loans and loans purchased at a discount due to their non performing status 
management attributes the increases in delinquency in the company s subprime and government servicing portfolios primarily to the overall seasoning aging of the loans 
management believes the delinquency rates in the company s servicing portfolio are consistent with industry experience for similar mortgage loan portfolios 
inflation an increase in inflation would have the most significant impact on the company s mortgage banking and capital markets segments 
interest rates normally increase during periods of rising inflation 
historically  as interest rates increase  mortgage loan production decreases  particularly from loan refinancings 
although an environment of gradual interest rate increases may signify an improving economy or increasing real estate values  which in turn may stimulate increased home buying activity 
generally in such periods of reduced mortgage loan production  the associated profit margins also decline due to increased competition amongst mortgage loan originators and to higher unit costs  thus further reducing earnings from the loan production sector 
conversely  in a rising interest rate environment  loan servicing sector earnings generally increase because mortgage prepayment rates tend to slow down  thereby extending the average life of the company s servicing portfolio and thus reducing the amortization and impairment of msrs 
within the capital markets segment  rising interest rates generally lead to a reduction in activity and associated earnings in the segment s primary market  the mortgage market 
seasonality the mortgage banking industry is generally subject to seasonal trends 
these seasonal trends reflect the pattern in the national housing market 
home sales typically rise during the spring and summer seasons and decline during the fall and winter seasons 
the affect of this seasonality is muted to the extent of mortgage refinancing activity  which is primarily driven by prevailing mortgage rates 
in addition  mortgage delinquency rates typically rise temporarily in the winter months driven by mortgagor payment patterns 
liquidity and capital resources the company has significant short term and long term financing needs 
principal short term financing needs arise from the warehousing of mortgage loans pending sale and the trading activities of the broker dealer 
the company s investments in msrs and other retained interests  the financial instruments acquired to manage the interest rate risk associated with those investments and continued growth in the company s portfolio lending activities create the primary need for long term financing 
as discussed in the following paragraphs  the company meets its financing needs in a variety of ways  tapping the corporate debt and equity markets  as well as the mortgage and asset backed securities markets  and increasingly in the future through the deposit gathering and other financing activities of the bank 
public corporate debt markets a key source of financing for the company is the unsecured public corporate debt market 
typically  the company accesses this market by issuing commercial paper and medium term notes 
in the past  the company also has issued subordinated debt  convertible debt and trust preferred securities 
the company uses the public corporate debt markets because it is the most efficient and cost effective means of raising capital  owing to its depth and breadth 
the company s ongoing access to the public corporate debt markets depends upon maintaining the company s high credit standing  as primarily evidenced by its credit ratings 
the company has consistently maintained solid investment grade ratings over the last eleven years 
chl  the company s primary issuer of public corporate debt  presently has long term ratings of a a a as rated by standard poor s  moody s investors service and fitch  inc  respectively 
over that period  there has been no significant disruption in the company s access to the public corporate debt markets 
among other things  maintenance of investment grade ratings requires high levels of liquidity  including access to alternative sources of funding such as committed bank stand by lines of credit  as well as a capital structure that makes conservative use of financial leverage 
the company currently has secured and unsecured committed bank lines of credit and reusable mortgage purchase commitments totaling billion 
the company ensures that its outstanding commercial paper does not exceed the unused portion of these facilities 
to further manage its liquidity  the company strives to maintain additional unused amounts within its lines to meet its expected operational cash requirements  including debt maturities  for the succeeding six months with a cushion for unanticipated cash needs 
a substantial portion of the company s assets are highly liquid in nature for example  mortgage loans and mbs held for sale and trading securities 
the company s policy is to finance of its non liquid assets such as msrs and other retained interests with long term capital equity and debt with maturities greater than six months 
the company has established internal guidelines for financial leverage by business segment 
these guidelines primarily take into account the nature of each segment s major assets 
for example  the loan production sector and capital markets segment have assets that are highly liquid and short term in nature  which is reflected in the company s current financial leverage ratio debt equity targets of and  respectively 
on the other hand  the loan servicing sector contains msrs and other retained interests that are generally perceived by the rating agencies and others to have significant inherent risks  despite the company s successful and ongoing risk management practices 
this results in the need to maintain a high percentage of equity capital to finance these investments in order to maintain the company s high credit standing 
the company s current financial leverage ratio target for the loan servicing sector is management believes the amount of equity capital required to finance its msrs and other retained interests is high relative to its major competitors and such requirement increases the overall cost of capital for the company 
in addition to internal leverage guidelines  the company periodically performs various internal analyses designed to assess the sensitivity of the company s net worth to changes in interest rates 
the company s capital adequacy also is measured and evaluated by the federal reserve through its defined capital ratio tests 
the company s policy is to maintain its capital ratios at or above the well capitalized standards defined by the federal reserve 
the company s primary source of equity capital is retained earnings 
the company also has outstanding million in trust preferred securities that receive varying degrees of equity treatment from rating agencies  bank lenders and regulators 
in addition  the company currently has a billion deferred tax liability that would offset a portion of any potential loss in value of the company s msrs and which  to that extent  can be viewed as equity capital 
from time to time  the company does engage in stock offerings as a means of supplementing its capital base and to support its growth 
the company maintains an open dialogue and meets at least annually with each credit rating agency to review the company s performance and outlook 
issues of concern to one or more credit rating agency in the past have included the company s significant investment in msrs and other retained interests  its involvement in subprime lending  as well as its liquidity and capital structure 
on february   fitch placed the company on rating watch negative 
this action indicates a potential downgrade by fitch in the near future of chl s short term and long term ratings  which currently stand at f and a  respectively 
fitch has cited concerns over the company s msrs as the primary reason for this action 
in response  management has scheduled a meeting with fitch and is preparing additional analysis to assist fitch in conducting its ratings process 
in addition  management is evaluating other ways to address fitch s concerns  including raising additional capital 
management believes the company s current credit ratings from both moody s and standard and poor s are stable 
nonetheless  the credit rating agencies could lower the company s credit ratings in the future 
in the unlikely event the company s credit ratings were to drop below investment grade its access to the public corporate debt markets would be severely limited 
the cutoff for investment grade is generally considered to be a long term rating of bbb  or three gradations below the company s lowest current long term rating 
the company would have to rely upon alternative sources of financing  such as bank lines and private debt placements secured and unsecured 
furthermore  the company would likely be unable to retain all of its existing bank credit commitments beyond the then existing maturity dates 
as a consequence  its cost of financing would rise significantly and it may have to curtail some of its capital intensive activities  such as its ongoing investment in msrs and other retained interests 
on the other hand  given the liquidity of its mortgage inventory and broker dealer trading portfolio  the company would likely be able to arrange secured financing for such assets 
over the long term  however  it would be difficult for the company to compete effectively without investment grade ratings 
however  notwithstanding the recent action by fitch  management believes a ratings downgrade to below investment grade by any credit rating agency in the foreseeable future is unlikely 
secondary mortgage market the company also places great reliance on the secondary mortgage market 
substantially all mortgage loans produced by the company are sold in the secondary mortgage market  primarily in the form of mortgage backed securities mbs and asset backed securities 
the majority of the mbs sold by the company are guaranteed by either fannie mae  freddie mac  or ginnie mae collectively  agency mbs 
non agency or private label mbs and asset backed securities are also issued by the company 
private label mbs and asset backed securities are registered with the sec and have separate credit ratings 
generally private label mbs and asset backed securities require some form of credit enhancement  such as over collateralization  senior sub structures  primary mortgage insurance  company guarantees and or private surety guarantees 
the agency mbs market is extremely liquid 
the private label mbs market  particularly the subprime mbs market  is significantly less liquid  although the company has enjoyed essentially uninterrupted access to those markets  albeit at varying costs 
the company ensures its ongoing access to the secondary mortgage market by consistently producing quality mortgages and servicing those mortgages at levels that meet or exceed secondary mortgage market standards 
as described elsewhere in this document  quality assurance is a major focus of management and the company makes significant investments in personnel and technology in this regard 
as part of its overall liquidity management  the company acquired a reusable billion commitment from a multi seller asset backed commercial paper conduit to purchase loans from the company that are in process of being pooled into agency mbs 
the company has another such billion commitment in place to sell delinquent fha and va loans that have been removed from agency mbs pending foreclosure and liquidation 
the private label securitizations and committed purchase facilities discussed above are conducted through wholly owned special purpose entities spes that facilitate the securitization of mortgage loans 
in connection with these securitization transactions  the loans are either sold directly to the spe or to a trust through an spe 
the trust issues beneficial interests in the form of securities that are sold to investors 
the company does not carry contractual obligations related to these spes or the loans sold to them  except for the standard representations and warranties made in connection with private label securitizations 
the company retains servicing on the loans sold to these trusts and periodically retains an interest in the form of interest only securities  principal only securities and residuals  which the company generally holds as long term investments 
in addition  the company may issue a corporate guarantee for losses up to a contractually specified amount 
the spes  while owned by the company  are generally controlled by a third party trustees for the benefit of unaffiliated beneficial interest holders 
in addition  the activities of the spes are limited 
for these reasons  among others  the accounting literature requires the exclusion of these spes from the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company also utilizes short term repurchase agreements as a means of financing securities and loans pending sale  as well as csc s securities trading portfolio 
although this method of financing is uncommitted and short term in nature  it has proven to be very reliable and cost effective 
bank activities management intends to significantly increase the size of treasury bank over the next three years to a targeted total asset size of billion 
management intends to realize this goal by utilizing countrywide s loan origination platform so that the bank can originate loans for the bank s investment portfolio 
funding for this growth will come from a variety of sources  including transfers of impound accounts controlled by chl  secured advances from the federal home loan bank and from retail deposits generated from the company s customer base and elsewhere 
cash flow cash flow from operating activities was negative billion for  compared to negative billion for the ten months ended december  the reduction in negative cash flow from operations for the year ended december  was due primarily to a billion net reduction in mortgage loans held for sale 
net cash used in investing activities was billion for  compared to billion for the ten months ended december  the increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to a billion net increase in available for sale securities and a billion net increase in additions to msrs 
net cash provided by financing activities during totaled billion  compared to billion during the ten months ended december  the increase in cash provided by financing activities during was comprised of a billion net increase in growth in bank deposit liabilities and a billion net increase in the growth of short term primarily secured borrowings 
prospective trends united states mortgage market over the last decade  total mortgage indebtedness in the united states has grown at an average annual rate of eight percent 
management believes that continued population growth  ongoing developments in the mortgage market and the prospect of relatively low interest rates support similar growth in the market for the foreseeable future 
some of the on going developments in the mortgage market include government sponsored programs targeted to increase homeownership in low income and minority communities  the growth of prime home equity lending as a major form of consumer finance and the increasing efficiency of the secondary mortgage market that lowers the overall cost of homeownership 
in recent years  the level of complexity in the mortgage lending business has increased significantly due to several factors the continuing evolution of the secondary mortgage market has resulted in a proliferation of mortgage products  greater regulation imposed on the industry has resulted in increased costs and the need for higher levels of specialization  and interest rate volatility has risen over the last decade 
at the same time  homeowners propensity to refinance their mortgages has increased as the refinance process has become more efficient and cost effective 
the combined result has been large swings in the volume of mortgage loans originated from year to year 
these swings in mortgage origination volume have placed significant pressure on both the originations and the servicing sides of the mortgage business 
to compete effectively in this environment requires mortgage lenders to have a very high level of operational  technological  and managerial expertise 
in addition  the residential mortgage business has become more capital intensive and therefore access to capital at a competitive cost is critical 
primarily as a result of these factors  the industry has undergone rapid consolidation 
today  large  sophisticated financial institutions currently dominate the residential mortgage industry 
these industry leaders are primarily commercial banks operating through their mortgage banking subsidiaries 
today  the top twenty five mortgage lenders combined have a share of the mortgage origination market  up from five years ago 
following is a year over year comparison of market share for the top five originators  according to inside mortgage finance year ended year ended december  de cember  institution wells fargo home mortgage washington mutual countrywide chase home finance abn amro mortgage group total for top this consolidation trend has carried over to the loan servicing side of the mortgage business 
today  the top twenty five mortgage servicers combined have a share of the total mortgages outstanding  up from five years ago 
following is a year over year comparison of market share for the top five servicers  according to inside mortgage finance year ended ye ar ended december  decem ber  institution washington mutual wells fargo home mortgage countrywide chase home finance bank of america mortgage total for top five management believes the consolidation trend in the mortgage market will continue  as the aforementioned market forces will continue to drive out weak competitors 
the company believes it will benefit from this trend through increased market share 
in addition  management believes that irrational price competition which from time to time has plagued the industry in the past should lessen in the future 
compared to the company  the other industry leaders are less reliant on the secondary mortgage market as an outlet for adjustable rate mortgages  due to their greater portfolio lending capacity 
this could place the company at a competitive disadvantage in the future if the demand for adjustable rate mortgages increases significantly  the secondary mortgage market does not provide a competitive outlet for these loans and the company is unable to develop a portfolio lending capacity similar to the competition 
housing appreciation housing values affect the company in several ways increasing housing values point to healthy demand for purchase money mortgage financing  increased average loan balances  and a reduction in the risk of loss on sale of foreclosed real estate in the event a loan defaults and the company is required to absorb all or a portion of the resulting loss 
over the last several years  the housing price index has significantly outpaced the consumer price index 
furthermore  the housing affordability index is at near historic highs 
consequently  management expects housing values to increase at a slower rate in the coming year than in the past several years 
over the long term  management expects housing price index and consumer price index to be closely correlated 
regulatory trends the regulatory environments in which the company operates have an impact on the activities in which the company may engage  how the activities may be carried out and the profitability of those activities 
therefore  changes to laws  regulations or regulatory policies can affect whether and to what extent the company is able to operate profitably 
for example  proposed state and federal legislation targeted at predatory lending could have the unintended consequence of raising the cost or otherwise reducing the availability of mortgage credit for those potential borrowers with less than prime quality credit histories  thereby resulting in a reduction of otherwise legitimate sub prime lending opportunities 
similarly  certain proposed state and federal privacy legislation  if passed  could have an adverse impact on the company s ability to cross sell the non mortgage products offered by countrywide s various divisions to its customer base in a cost effective manner 
mortgage originations following is the estimated total united states mortgage originations market for each of the last five years united states mortgage calendar year originations billions source mortgage bankers association forecasters put the market for at between trillion and trillion 
although such a market would represent a significant decline from s historic level  it would still be a highly favorable market for the company s loan production business and would place continuing  although lessening  pressure on its loan servicing business due to continuing higher than normal mortgage loan prepayment activity 
the refinance activity is expected to slow in which is the cause of decline in the estimated market in accordingly  competitive pressures are expected to increase in the loan production business as a greater emphasis is placed on purchase money mortgages
