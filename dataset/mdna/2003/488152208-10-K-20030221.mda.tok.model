item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations versus sales for totaled billion  an increase of compared to the billion reported in the prior year 
the increase was primarily the result of an increase in average hourly bill rates of 
hours worked were essentially unchanged year over year 
sales increases in the us commercial staffing and professional  technical and staffing alternatives ptsa segments were partially offset by a slight sales decrease in the international segment 
gross profit of million was lower than the gross profit of million in gross profit as a percentage of sales was in  a decrease of percentage point compared to the rate recorded in the prior year 
gross profit rates of the ptsa and international segments declined while us commercial staffing remained relatively unchanged 
the decline in gross profit rates was due primarily to a continuing shift in the mix of customers to large corporate and national accounts and a decline in recruitment fee income 
many of the company s large corporate and national account customers have negotiated high volume global service agreements  which tend to result in lower gross profit rates than those earned with the company s small and medium size customers 
the company s strategy is focused on serving and growing these large corporate and national accounts 
as customer mix shifts to large corporate and national accounts  the company s average gross margins tend to decrease 
offsetting this impact  there are economies of scale and other expense savings associated with servicing these large accounts that tend to mitigate the overall effect on profitability 
the company expects this trend to continue in fee based recruitment income  which represents approximately one percent of the company s total sales  has a significant impact on gross profit rates 
there are very low direct costs of services associated with recruitment income 
therefore  decreases in permanent placement fees can have a disproportionate impact on gross profit rates 
as compared to last year  many customers reduced or eliminated the recruiting of full time employees and the conversions of temporary to permanent staff 
the company expects that recruitment fee income will begin to increase when economic growth and job creation resume 
selling  general and administrative expenses of million were lower than last year 
the expense rate improved to of sales in as compared to in the decrease was due primarily to staff reductions and lower telecommunication and recruiting costs  which were the result of expense reduction initiatives the company implemented during  and the elimination of goodwill amortization see discussion to follow in critical accounting policies 
the staff reductions in both field operations and headquarters units generated savings of approximately million in as compared with the prior year 
the company did not incur significant termination costs as a result of these staff reductions 
the majority of the staff reductions took place during the second and third quarters of these savings were partially offset by field and headquarters bonus payments  which increased due to the company s improved performance  the effect of currency rates on international expenses and increased depreciation expense as a result of the company s ongoing deployment of information technology programs 
earnings from operations in totaled million  an increase compared to the million reported for the increase in earnings from operations was the result of many factors discussed above  including the elimination of goodwill amortization of million 
earnings were of sales for both and net interest income for was thousand  a thousand improvement compared to last year s net interest expense of thousand 
the improvement is primarily attributable to higher cash balances and lower short term debt levels  offset by the impact of lower interest rates 
earnings before taxes were million  an increase of from earnings before taxes averaged of sales in and of sales in the effective income tax rate in was  a percentage point improvement compared with last year s rate 
the decrease in the overall income tax rate was the result of several factors including the favorable settlement of prior years tax audits  offset by an increase in valuation reserves related to the company s ability to utilize foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
net earnings were million in  a increase compared to the million earned in basic and diluted earnings per share were  an increase of as compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of in us commercial staffing sales in the us commercial staffing segment  which represented of total company sales in and  totaled billion in  a increase compared to the billion reported for the increase was primarily the result of an increase in average hourly bill rates of  offset by a decrease in hours worked 
year over year sales comparisons were down in the first quarter  flat in the second quarter  up in the third quarter and up in the fourth quarter 
sales trends were relatively stable month by month over the course of the fourth quarter 
us commercial staffing earnings totaled million  an increase of in  as a result of the sales increase  relatively stable gross profit rates and a decrease in expenses 
the gross profit rate averaged in both and improvements in benefit costs were offset by the impact of an ongoing shift in mix of sales to larger corporate and national accounts 
year over year gross profit rate comparisons for us commercial staffing were down in the first and second quarters and up in the third and fourth quarters 
the increase in gross profit rate in the second half of reflected improvement in benefits costs relative to last year  including workers compensation expense  and increased fee based income in the fourth quarter 
given relatively high and rising unemployment in the us  the company expects an increase in state unemployment taxes in which  to the extent not recovered through pricing actions  may decrease the gross profit rate for us commercial staffing 
us commercial staffing expenses were tightly controlled and decreased year over year primarily due to staff reductions and lower recruiting costs  partially offset by higher field bonus payouts and the impact of the company s ongoing deployment of new front office systems 
professional  technical and staffing alternatives professional  technical and staffing alternatives ptsa includes the following business units kelly scientific resources  kelly healthcare resources  kelly home care services  kelly automotive services group  kelly engineering resources  kelly it resources  kelly law registry  kelly financial resources  kelly management services  kelly staff leasing  kelly hr consulting  hrfirst and kelly vendor management solutions 
sales in the ptsa segment totaled billion  an increase of compared to the billion reported in the growth is due to an increase in average hourly bill rates of  partially offset by a decrease in hours worked of in the professional and technical businesses 
in addition  there was an increase in revenues of in the staffing alternatives businesses  which include staff leasing and management services 
ptsa sales represented of total company sales in and in during  kelly healthcare resources and kelly financial resources continued to be the leading performers  exhibiting sales growth of over as compared to kelly staff leasing  kelly engineering resources  kelly it resources  kelly management services and kelly law registry also maintained positive sales growth in kelly automotive services group posted positive growth in the second half of the year  resulting in a slight overall increase year over year 
however  kelly home care services experienced a significant revenue decline during as compared to this decrease  however  was consistent with industry trends in its staffing sector 
although kelly staff leasing experienced positive sales growth in  we are changing their customer mix to better position this business for the long term 
as a result  we expect our staff leasing sales to decline by to in the first quarter of however  with a stronger customer base  we expect there will be a small positive impact to earnings 
ptsa earnings from operations totaled million in  an increase of from this was the result of the increase in sales  partially offset by a percentage point decrease in the gross profit rate and the effect of holding expenses to a increase 
the decrease in the gross profit rate was due to changes in business unit mix and rate decreases in certain business units  such as kelly automotive services group and kelly it resources 
the most significant factor impacting the business unit mix was the decline in sales at the kelly home care services unit  which has a higher than average gross profit rate 
these declines were partially offset by a year over year increase in ptsa fee based income 
as discussed with respect to us commercial staffing  the company expects an increase in state unemployment taxes in which  to the extent not recovered through pricing actions  may decrease the gross profit rate for ptsa 
ptsa expenses increased from the prior year  due to higher field bonus payouts  the impact of the company s ongoing deployment of new front office systems  higher liability insurance costs and increased facilities expense associated with the expansion of kelly financial resources and kelly healthcare resources 
this was partially offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization and lower recruiting costs 
expenses as a percent of sales decreased to in from in international translated us dollar sales in international totaled billion  a decrease compared to the billion reported in this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in recruitment fees and a decrease in hours worked 
us dollar average bill rates were essentially unchanged year over year 
international sales represented of total company sales in and of total company sales in the americas and asia pacific  the first regions within the international segment to reflect the negative impact of the global economic slowdown  are continuing to show improvement 
year over year sales comparisons in continental europe and the united kingdom remained negative throughout during  the us dollar continued to fall in comparison to many foreign currencies  including the euro and british pound 
as a result  kelly s us dollar translated sales and expenses were higher than would have otherwise been reported 
on a constant currency basis  international revenue decreased 
this compared to overall constant currency sales growth in year over year constant currency sales declined in the first quarter  in the second quarter  in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter 
if foreign currency exchange rates remain at their current levels  kelly s first and second quarter sales will be favorably impacted 
international earnings totaled million  a decrease of from  resulting from the decrease in sales and a percentage point decline in the gross profit rate  partially offset by a reduction in expenses 
the decline in the gross profit rate was primarily due to the decrease in recruitment fee income  with the most significant decrease occurring in the united kingdom 
on a year over year basis  translated us dollar expenses in the international segment decreased  primarily due to lower wages and recruiting costs and the elimination of goodwill amortization

the gross profit rate averaged  a decrease of percentage points compared to the rate earned in this reflected decreases in the gross profit rates of all three of the company s business segments 
the decline in gross profit rates was due primarily to a continuing shift in the mix of customers to large corporate and national accounts and a decline in recruitment fee income

us commercial staffing sales represented of total company sales in and of total company sales in us commercial staffing earnings from operations totaled million in  a decrease of compared to the million reported in the sales decrease  combined with a percentage point decrease in the gross profit rate  produced the earnings decline

however  several units within ptsa did experience sales decreases as the year progressed 
in particular  kelly automotive services group and kelly law registry experienced double digit sales declines as compared to these decreases  however  were consistent with industry trends in their staffing sectors 
ptsa sales represented of total company sales in and of total company sales in ptsa earnings for decreased from during the first nine months of  the company continued to invest in those professional and technical businesses  which exhibited stronger growth 
the company opened new branches and implemented new technology  which caused expenses to be higher as compared to the prior year

liquidity and capital resources historically  kelly has financed its operations through cash generated by operating activities and revolving credit facilities 
as highlighted in the statements of cash flows  the company s liquidity and available capital resources are impacted by four key components current cash and equivalents  operating activities  investing activities and financing activities 
cash and equivalents cash and equivalents totaled million at the end of  an increase of million from the million at year end operating activities in  the company generated million in cash from operating activities  as compared to million in and million in the most significant reason for the decline in cash generated from operations in versus  as well as the increase in cash generated from operations in versus  was a change in accounts receivable 
the company experienced declining revenues in which caused a decrease in accounts receivable and generated million in cash 
during  revenues increased slightly and were improving as the year progressed 
as a result  the company used million of cash to fund accounts receivable 
accounts receivable totaled million at year end global days sales outstanding for the fourth quarter were days  which is a one day improvement versus the days in the prior year 
if the economy recovers in  the company may experience improving revenue  which may require the company to fund a resulting increase in accounts receivable 
the company s working capital position was million at the end of  an increase of million from and million from the current ratio was at the end of as compared with in and investing activities in  the company used million on investing activities compared to million in and million in the most significant reasons for the continued reductions in cash used for investing activities are decreasing levels of capital expenditures and the one time purchase of a building in in addition  the company spent million on three acquisitions in no acquisitions were made in or capital expenditures for totaled million  down from the million spent in  reflecting the planned delay of several projects 
of the total million spent in  approximately related to information technology 
the company s capital expenditures peaked in at million  decreased in to million and decreased again in to million

financing activities in  the company used million in financing activities compared to million in and million in the decrease in as compared to was primarily related to lower short term debt repayments and reduced dividends offset by the purchase of treasury stock 
the increase in as compared to was primarily related to the net repayment of short term debt in as compared to additional borrowing in  as well as reduced dividends 
short term debt totaled million at year end compared to million at year end and at year end all short term borrowings are foreign currency denominated and reduce the company s exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations 
at year end  debt represented less than of total capital 
as of year end  the company had million of committed unused credit facilities 
the company s million five year  unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility expires in october of it is the company s intention to complete a new unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility prior to expiration of the current facility

summary the company s financial position remains strong 
the company continues to carry no long term debt and expects to meet its cash requirements  including possible increases in accounts receivable as discussed above  principally through cash generated from operations  available cash and equivalents and committed unused credit facilities 
market risk sensitive instruments and positions kelly does not hold or invest in derivative contracts 
the company is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily due to its net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
this risk is mitigated by the use of the company s multi currency line of credit 
this credit facility is used to borrow in local currencies which mitigates the exchange rate risk resulting from foreign currency denominated net investments fluctuating in relation to the us dollar 
in addition  the company is exposed to interest rate risks through its use of the multi currency line of credit 
in addition  the company is exposed to market risk as a result of its obligation to pay benefits under its nonqualified deferred compensation plan and its related investments in company owned variable universal life insurance policies 
the obligation to employees increases and decreases based on movements in the equity and debt markets 
the investments in publicly traded mutual funds  as part of the company owned variable universal life insurance policies  are designed to mitigate this risk with offsetting gains and losses 
overall  the company s holdings and positions in market risk sensitive instruments do not subject the company to material risk 
critical accounting policies the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in this process  it is necessary for management to make certain assumptions and related estimates affecting the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the attached notes 
actual results can differ from assumed and estimated amounts 
critical accounting policies are those that management believes require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the company considers the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we consider our historical level of credit losses and apply percentages to certain aged receivable categories 
we also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations  and we monitor current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
historically  losses from uncollectible accounts have not exceeded our allowance 
since we cannot predict with certainty future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger allowance may be required 
in the event we determined that a smaller or larger allowance was appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to selling  general and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination 
as of year end  and  the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was million  million and million  respectively 
workers compensation the company has a combination of insurance and self insurance contracts under which the company effectively bears the first  of risk per single accident 
the company establishes accruals for workers compensation utilizing actuarial methods to estimate the undiscounted future cash payments that will be made to satisfy the claims  including an allowance for incurred but not reported claims 
this process includes establishing loss development factors  based on the historical claims experience of the company and the industry  and applying those factors to current claims information to derive an estimate of the company s ultimate claims liability 
in preparing the estimates  we also consider the nature and severity of the claims  analyses provided by third party claims administrators  as well as current legal  economic and regulatory factors 
management evaluates the accrual  and the underlying assumptions  regularly throughout the year and makes adjustments as needed 
the ultimate cost of these claims may be greater than or less than the established accrual 
while management believes that the recorded amounts are adequate  there can be no assurances that changes to management s estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimation process 
in the event we determine that a smaller or larger accrual is appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to cost of services in the period in which we made such a determination 
the accrual for workers compensation was million  million and million at year end  and  respectively 
goodwill effective december   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which established a new method of testing goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment using a fair value based approach 
under the new standard  goodwill is no longer amortized as was previously required 
upon adoption  amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets ceased 
amortization of goodwill would have been million for the fiscal year ended december  sfas requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually or if an event occurs or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its book value 
should circumstances change or events occur to indicate that the fair market value of the reporting unit has fallen below its book value  management must then compare the estimated fair value of goodwill to book value 
if the book value exceeds the estimated fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
such an impairment loss would be recognized as a non cash charge to operating income 
we completed our impairment test as of the date of adoption  december  and during the fourth quarter of the year ended december  as required under sfas and determined that goodwill is not impaired 
this test required comparison of our estimated fair value to our book value of goodwill 
the estimated fair value was based on a discounted cash flows analysis 
assumptions and estimates about future cash flows and discount rates are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
different assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in an impairment charge  which would decrease operating income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 
at year end  and  total goodwill amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which supersedes eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred  rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan as was required by eitf no 
this statement is effective for disposal activities initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in november  the fasb released fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin establishes new disclosure and liability recognition requirements for direct and indirect debt guarantees with specified characteristics 
the initial measurement and recognition requirements of fin are effective prospectively for guarantees issued or modified after december  however  the disclosure requirements are effective for interim and annual financial statement periods ending after december  the company has adopted the disclosure provisions and management does not expect the full adoption of fin to have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position
