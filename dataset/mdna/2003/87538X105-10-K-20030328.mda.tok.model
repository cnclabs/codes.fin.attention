operating expenses were up from with increases in personnel costs wages and health insurance and advertising contributing the majority of the increase 
manager bonuses were up in as well due to the increased operating profits of the stores over gross margin as a percentage of sales improved from for to for we believe  generally speaking  that the leather factory s gross margin has little room for additional improvement due to the mix of customers it serves 
we continue to negotiate with vendors for lower pricing of product that we purchase and we believe we were successful in that endeavor in most of our product categories 
we will continue to look for opportunities in our purchasing efforts as those opportunities present themselves  however  we also believe that we have maximized those efforts as much as can reasonably be expected at the present time 
future fluctuations in gross margins will occur primarily as a result of the mix of the product categories sold and the correlating margins associated with those categories 
our product line is made up of approximately  items 
we have further expanded our merchandise categories from those discussed in our annual report as follows merchandise category gp gp belt strips and straps books  patterns and videos buckles conchos craft supplies custom tools and hardware dyes  finishes  glues and supplies hand tools hardware kits laces leather shoe supplies stamping tools leather factory store gross profit margin overall tandy leather stores tandy leather was operated strictly as an order fulfillment house for orders generated via phone  fax  mail order  and internet in in  we began the development of the retail store chain while temporarily operating the order fulfillment house

through the end of march  we have opened five stores in the baltimore  md store opened in january  the tulsa  ok store opened in february  and stores in pittsburgh  pa  orange county  ca  and atlanta  ga opened in march 
we remain committed to a conservative growth plan that minimizes risks to the company s profits and financial stability 
we moved tandy to a new point of sale software in april which allows us to track its sales mix in a similar fashion as that of the leather factory

due to the elimination of the order fulfillment house ofh during the year and the introduction of the fourteen retail stores  we present the financial performance of the two operational structures separately ofh stores total net sales    cost of sales    gross profit    operating expenses    operating income    while we believe that the stores are able to improve their operating efficiency and will continue to work toward that end  we also believe that the table above proves our theory that the retail stores can operate much more efficiently than a centralized order fulfillment house 
the largest expenses for the stores  as a percentage of sales  are salaries and wages  advertising  and shipping 
while it is unrealistic to expect an elimination of shipping expenses shipping product to customers by the stores  we do expect this expense to decrease as more stores are open and our over the counter sales increase 
cushman cushman s sales were up modestly in while gross profit margins increased from to  an improvement of 
we still believe cushman is continuing to gain market share in the industry and that belief was further strengthened in as one of our main competitors went out of business in late operating income increased from a  loss in to income of  for the elimination of goodwill amortization accounted for the improvement 
overall  we are pleased with cushman s performance in and believe we will see continued improvement in see financial condition section below for detailed discussion regarding the effect of the change in accounting principle and the resulting write down of cushman s goodwill in other expense and provision for income taxes other expenses decreased approximately 
the decrease is attributable to the interest paid on our outstanding debt 
while there was only a slight drop in the interest rate during compared to  the average outstanding debt balance dropped significantly 
our average outstanding debt balance in was  while the average outstanding debt balance was the provision for federal and state income taxes was of income before taxes compared to in the reduction results from the conversion of the operating entities from corporations to more tax favored entities limited partnership in certain states in which we operate and the elimination of goodwill amortization for book purposes in analysis of compared to consolidated net sales for increased million  or  compared to tandy contributed million to the increase as included a full year of tandy s operations  while only included december operations

the majority of the overall sales increase was to our craft customers 
our retail sales  while holding steady at of our total sales  increased in dollars by over last year s retail sales 
we experienced sales declines in our institution and midas markets  but compensated by gains in the wholesale and asc groups 
operating income for leather factory increased by  and improved the operating margin to net sales from in to in the increase in operating income results from improved gross profit margins as well as a slight improvement in operating efficiency 
operating expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of sales 
management s target for leather factory s operating expenses as a percentage of sales is or less and that target was met for gross margin as a percentage of sales improved by basis points primarily as a result of the changes we made in sourcing product purchasing from different vendors at a lower price 
leather represents approximately of our inventory in dollars at any given time and also represents approximately of our sales 
however  we earn the smallest amount of gross profit margin on the leather we sell for and  gross profit margin on leather sold was approximately 
the improvement in our margins comes from the items sold in the other categories 
tandy leather order fulfillment tandy leather was acquired by the company in november  therefore our results for only included one month s operation for tandy leather 
in  tandy operated strictly as an order fulfillment house for orders generated via phone  fax  mail order  and internet 
our sales target was million  based on tandy s annual sales prior to acquisition 
tandy missed that target by  however  we discovered early in the year that some of tandy s sales were at very low profit margins and  in a few cases  were below cost 
we quickly adjusted selling prices to eliminate these low margin sales problems and as a result  lost some sales from customers who were not willing to pay the new prices 
therefore  even though tandy s sales were slightly below expectation  we improved gross profit margins by over percentage points 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales were held virtually constant from to at 
cushman cushman s sales were down in  even though we believe that we continue to gain market share from our competitors because of our commitment to timely delivery of quality product 
the primary reason for this decrease is not caused by a reduction in number of trims produced  but in the type of trims produced 
the popularity of the straw hat  which is a more casual hat versus the felt hat  is increasing every year due in part to straw hats being less expensive than felt and in part to the fashion trends 
historically  straw hats were worn in the spring and summer seasons while felt hats were the hat of choice in the fall and winter 
now it is acceptable to wear straw hats year round 
the global warming theory may also contribute to this shift in the headwear trend as straw hats are cooler to wear than felt hats 
as a result  the trims being requested by the manufacturers are made from materials other than leather 
leather trims are the most expensive  but generally are not put on straw hats 
therefore  even though we produced as many trims in as we did in  the selling price of these non leather trims is much lower than that of the leather trims 
operating income decreased significantly due primarily to a drop in gross profit margin 
in  we sold some trims at substantially reduced prices for two reasons the market conditions and trends in the headwear industry in general  and to clear out some of our inventory that does not fit with the fashion trends developing 
we reduced our personnel costs late in to help offset the low gross profit margins 
other expense and provision for income taxes other expenses decreased approximately 
the decrease is attributable to the reduction in the interest rates during compared to our average interest rate in was while the average interest rate in was 
in addition  there was a slight decrease in our average outstanding debt balance from million in to million in the provision for federal and state income taxes was of pre tax income the same as in the dollar increase in our income tax expense results from the increase in income 
financial condition at december   we had inventory of million and net property and equipment of million 
goodwill and other intangibles net of amortization and depreciation were million and  respectively 
the company also holds  in a leather artwork collection  most of which was created by al stohlman  a legendary leathercrafter 
net total assets were million 
current liabilities were million including million of current maturities of long term debt  while long term debt was  total stockholders equity at the end of had increased to million  principally as a result of the million of net income recorded during during  net cash provided from operating activities was million 
we applied million to reduce the outstanding balance on our credit facility described below  leaving an outstanding principal balance of million as of december  as a result of various acquisitions made during our history  we had recorded goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet and had amortized this goodwill through the end of in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a new accounting rule regarding the amortization of goodwill sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of that pronouncement  effective january   the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives ceased and goodwill was subject to an impairment test based on its fair value 
the majority of the goodwill million as presented on our consolidated balance sheet at december  belonged to cushman 
given the current trends of the industry in which cushman operates and cushman s financial results over the last several years  we felt it necessary to engage a business valuation firm to determine cushman s fair value 
based on that assessment  we incurred an impairment write down of all of the cushman goodwill in the first quarter of in the amount of million 
the write down was only partially offset by the company s income before giving effect to this accounting change 
retained earnings and total stockholders equity at the end of were million and million  down from million and million at the end of the company does not anticipate any other similar write downs at this time 
at december   we owned million of inventory and million of property and equipment 
goodwill and other intangibles net of amortization and depreciation were  and  respectively and we still hold  in a leather artwork collection 
net total assets were million 
current liabilities were million including million of current maturities of long term debt  while long term debt was  total stockholders equity at the end of had decreased to million  principally as a result of the million net loss recorded during capital resources and liquidity on march   the company entered into a credit and security agreement with wells fargo bank minnesota  na wells fargo  which replaced the borrowing arrangement with wells fargo business credit  inc wfbc 
the facility matures in november and is secured by all of the assets of the company 
the company is currently in compliance with all covenants and conditions contained in the credit facility and has no reason to believe that it will not continue to operate in compliance with the provisions of these financing arrangements 
the principal terms and conditions of the credit facility are described in further detail in note notes payable and long term debt to the consolidated financial statements

cash flows from operations for were million 
the largest portion of the operating cash flow was generated from income before the goodwill write off 
consolidated accounts receivable decreased to million at december  compared to million at december  average days to collect accounts improved from days in to days in on a consolidated basis 
individually  leather factory s days to collect was days for  an improvement over of days 
tandy s days to collect was days for  an improvement of days from cushman s days to collect was for  an improvement of days from tandy s significant improvement in average days to collect is the result of the significant collection of delinquent accounts obtained in the tandy leather acquisition 
inventory increased to million at december  from million at the end of this increase was principally attributable to our efforts to boost inventory in anticipation of the dock strike on the west coast of the united states that has since ended  the surge in flow of goods to us after the strike ended and the backlog of shipments unloaded  and the addition of the fourteen new tandy leather stores in we have reduced our inventory purchases considerably in the first quarter of in order to return inventory to customary levels  although we anticipate it will be into the nd quarter of before the inventory begins to level out 
consolidated inventory turned times during  a slight slowdown from times and essentially the same as times 
separately  tandy leather s and inventory turns were times and times  respectively 
leather factory s inventory turned times in and times in  and cushman s inventory turned times and times in and  respectively 
the significant improvement in the inventory turn rate for tandy leather is due to the elimination of its central warehouse in september combined into leather factory s warehouse 
we now record only merchandise held in tandy leather stores as tandy leather inventory 
leather factory s turns slowed slightly in because it added the tandy leather warehouse inventory to the goods held for the leather factory store system 
additionally  the increase in inventory arriving at the central warehouse in the fourth quarter adversely affected leather factory s inventory turns 
leather factory store inventory turns  excluding the central warehouse inventory  were approximately and turns in and  respectively 
we compute our inventory turnover rates as sales divided by average inventory 
accounts payable increased to million at december  from million at the end of the increased inventory on hand at the end of accounted for the increase 
the company s current ratio improved at december  to  compared to at december  if  however  accounting rules had not required the company s debt with wells fargo to be classified as short term even though the stated maturity is in november  the current ratio at december  would have been 
the largest use of operating cash in was for debt reduction and various capital expenditures 
capital expenditures totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
capital expenditures in included approximately  in leasehold improvements for the central warehouse and factory consolidation and remodeling of the fort worth leather factory store

critical accounting policies the analysis and discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
us gaap provides the framework from which to make these estimates  assumptions and disclosures 
we choose accounting policies within us gaap that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report the company s operating results and financial position in a consistent manner 
management regularly assesses these policies in light of current and forecasted economic conditions 
the company s accounting policies are stated in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have summarized below the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to an understanding of the preparation of our financial statements 
basis of consolidation 
we report our financial information on a consolidated basis 
therefore  unless there is an indication to the contrary  financial information is provided for the parent company  the leather factory  inc  and its subsidiaries as a whole 
transactions between the parent company and any subsidiaries are eliminated for this purpose 
we own all of the capital stock of our subsidiaries  and we do not have any subsidiaries that are not consolidated 
none of our subsidiaries is off balance sheet 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue for retail over the counter sales as transactions occur and other sales upon shipment of our products provided that there are no significant post delivery obligations to the customer and collection is reasonably assured  which generally occurs upon shipment 
net sales represent gross sales less negotiated price allowances  product returns  and allowances for defective merchandise 
allowance for accounts receivable 
we reduce accounts receivable by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
this allowance is an estimate based primarily our evaluation of the customer s financial condition  past collection history  and the aging of the account 
if the financial condition of any of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment or inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market and is accounted for on the first in  first out method 
this means that sales of inventory treat the oldest item of identical inventory as being the first sold 
in addition  we periodically reduce the value of our inventory for slow moving or obsolete inventory 
this reduction is based on management s review of items on hand compared to their estimated future demand 
if actual future demand is less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be necessary 
goods shipped to us are recorded as inventory owned by us when the risk of loss shifts to us from the supplier 
goodwill 
we have indicated above that a change in the accounting rules necessitated a change in in how we report goodwill on our balance sheet 
as a result  we incurred an impairment write down in the first quarter of of our investment in cushman in the amount of million 
the remaining goodwill on our balance sheet is analyzed by management periodically to determine the appropriateness of its carry value 
as of december   management has determined that the present value of the discounted estimated future cash flows of the stores associated with the goodwill is sufficient to support their respective goodwill balances 
if actual results of these stores differs significantly from management s projections  such difference could affect the present value calculation in the future resulting in an impairment of all or part of the goodwill currently carried on the company s balance sheet 
forward looking statements item business and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report contain forward looking statements of management 
in general  these are predictions or suggestions of future events and statements or expectations of future occurrences 
there are certain important risks that could cause results to differ materially from those anticipated by some of the forward looking statements 
some  but not all  of the important risks which could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward looking statements include  among other things involvement by the united states in war and other military operations in the middle east could disrupt international trade and affect the company s inventory sources 
the recent slump in the economy in the united states  as well as abroad  may cause our sales to decrease or not to increase or adversely affect the prices charged for our products 
also  hostilities  terrorism or other events could worsen this condition 
as a result of the on going threat of terrorist attacks on the united states  consumer buying habits could change and decrease our sales 
the prices of hides and leathers also fluctuate in normal times  and these fluctuations can affect the company 
if  for whatever reason  the costs of our raw materials and inventory increase  we may not be able to pass those costs on to our customers  particularly if the economy has not recovered from its downturn 
other factors could cause either fluctuations in buying patterns or possible negative trends in the craft and western retail markets 
in addition  our customers may change their preferences to products other than ours  or they may not accept new products as we introduce them 
we might fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the opening of tandy leather retail stores or other retail initiatives might not be successful 
tax or interest rates might increase 
in particular  interest rates are likely to increase at some point from their present low levels 
these increases will increase our costs of borrowing funds as needed in our business 
any change in the commercial banking environment may affect us and our ability to borrow capital as needed 
other uncertainties  which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the company  may occur as well 
the company does not intend to update forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movement in foreign current exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
these exposures may change over time and could have a material impact on our financial results 
we do not use or invest in market risk sensitive instruments to hedge any of these risks or for any other purpose 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our primary foreign currency exposure is related to our subsidiary in canada 
the leather factory of canada  ltd 
has local currency canadian dollar revenue and local currency operating expenses 
changes in the currency exchange rate impacts the us dollar amount of revenue and expenses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  segment information  for financial information concerning the company s foreign activities 
interest rate risk we are subject to market risk associated with interest rate movements on outstanding debt 
our borrowings under the credit facility with wells fargo accrue interest at a rate that changes with fluctuations in the prime rate 
based on the company s level of debt at march   an increase of one percent in the prime rate would result in additional interest expense of approximately  during a twelve month period
