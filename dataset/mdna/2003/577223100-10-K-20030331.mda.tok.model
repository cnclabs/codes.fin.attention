item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document 
in addition to historical information  the discussion in this document contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements due to factors  including but not limited to  those set forth under the caption risk factors that may affect future results and market price of stock and elsewhere in this document 
overview we are a leading supplier of semiconductor wafer processing equipment used in the front end of line fabrication of integrated circuits 
our products include dry strip  rtp and pecvd equipment 
our manufacturing equipment utilizes innovative technology to deliver advanced processing capability and high productivity for both mm and mm production at technology nodes at and below nm 
our business depends upon capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductor devices 
the level of capital expenditures by these manufacturers depends upon the current and anticipated market demand for such devices 
the semiconductor industry has been experiencing a severe downturn since  which has resulted in capital spending cutbacks by our customers 
semiconductor companies continue to reevaluate their capital spending  postpone their new capital equipment purchase decisions  and reschedule or cancel existing orders 
declines in demand for semiconductors occurred throughout and  and are expected to continue in global economic conditions and consumer related demand have not improved  resulting in low levels of investment in corporate infrastructure 
the overall demand outlook is still uncertain over the intermediate term 
the cyclicality and uncertainties regarding overall market conditions continue to present significant challenges to us and impair our ability to forecast near term revenue 
given that many of our costs are fixed in the short term  our ability to quickly modify our operations in response to changes in market conditions is limited 
we are largely dependent upon increases in sales in order to attain profitability 
if our sales do not increase  our current operating expenses could prevent us from attaining profitability and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
on january   we simultaneously acquired the semiconductor equipment division of steag electronic systems ag the steag semiconductor division and cfm technologies  inc cfm  which we refer to as the merger 
the merger substantially changed the size of our company and the nature and breadth of our product lines 
at the time we completed the merger  our industry was entering an economic downturn that deepened sequentially and still continues 
the merger more than doubled the size of our company  and we faced a number of challenges in integrating the merged companies  coupled with downturn lower sales that resulted in excess production capacity 
during  we realigned our workforce and production capacity in light of current business levels 
during  we reduced our workforce by approximately  and in light of our business levels  and recorded restructuring charges of million primarily relating to employee severance and consolidation of facilities 
in addition  we recorded aggregate impairment charges of million for developed technology  fixed assets and long term assets relating to the company s wet operation 
during  we determined to refocus our business on our core technologies in dry strip and rapid thermal processing 
restructuring actions were taken in and the first quarter of to align the company with this focus and to reduce operational expenses 
as part of this restructuring effort  we divested one significant line of business  our wet products group  which was sold to scp global technologies  inc on march  we also narrowed our cvd focus to a limited number of strategic customers  and divested the subsidiary that had constituted our epi products group 
these divestitures were the last major actions in completing our strategic restructuring plan 
these actions are intended to reduce our cost structure and allow us to concentrate resources on the development of core products in enabling rtp and strip solutions 
our wet products business represented a significant portion of our revenue and our costs in and  and the divestiture of that business will affect the comparability of our financial statements in future periods to our reported results for and international sales  predominantly to customers based in europe  japan and the pacific rim  including taiwan  singapore  korea and china  accounted for of total net sales for  of total net sales for and of total net sales for we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales 
on april   we issued million shares of common stock in a private placement transaction 
of the million shares issued  million shares were issued to steag electronic systems ag upon conversion of million of outstanding promissory notes at per share 
the remaining million shares were sold to other investors at per share for aggregate net cash proceeds of million 
on june   we settled a patent infringement lawsuit with dainippon screen manufacturing co  ltd 
dns 
as part of the settlement  dns agreed to pay us  at minimum  million  relating to past damages  partial reimbursement of attorney s fees and costs  and royalties  payable in varying amounts at varying dates through april   in return for our granting dns a worldwide license under the previously infringed patents 
depending on the volume of future sales by dns  we could receive up to an additional million in royalty payments 
we determined  based on relative fair values  how much of the aggregate payments due to us are attributable to past damages and how much are attributable to future royalties on dns sales of wet processing products 
based on our analysis  which included an independent appraisal  we allocated million to past damages  which we recorded as other income during  and we allocated million to royalty income  which is being recognized in our income statements on a straight line basis over the license term 
during  we recognized approximately million of royalty revenue  and received payments aggregating million 
on march   we sold our wet surface preparation products business our wet business to scp global technologies  inc scp 
we had originally acquired the wet business on january   as part of our merger with the steag semiconductor divison and cfm 
as part of our sale of the wet business  scp acquired the operating assets  including customer contracts and inventory of one of our subsidiaries formerly cfm technologies  inc  all outstanding stock of mattson technology ip  inc  which is the owner of various patents relating to the wet business  and all equity ownership of mattson wet products gmbh  a german corporation 
we retained all cash in the wet business  and all rights to payments under the settlement and license agreements with dns  but we transferred all rights to any damages under pending patent litigation to scp 
upon closing  scp assumed responsibility for the operations  sales  marketing and technical support services for our former wet product lines worldwide 
we expect to reserve approximately million to million to cover our ongoing potential liability relating to this transaction 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgements  including those related to reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  warranty obligations  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring costs  retirement benefits  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgements on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  warranty obligations  inventories  goodwill and other intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets  and income taxes as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab we derive revenue from two primary sources equipment sales and spare part sales 
we account for equipment sales as follows for equipment sales of existing products with new specifications or to a new customer  for all sales of new products  and for all sales of our wet surface preparation products  revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance  for equipment sales to existing customers  who have purchased the same equipment with the same specifications and previously demonstrated acceptance provisions  we recognize revenue on a multiple element approach in which we bifurcate a sale transaction into two separate elements based on objective evidence of fair value of the individual elements 
the two elements are shipment of the tool and acceptance of the tool 
under this approach  the portion of the invoice price that is due upon final customer acceptance of the tool  generally of the total invoice price  is deferred until final customer acceptance of the tool 
the remaining portion of the total invoice price relating to the tool  generally of the total invoice price  is recognized upon shipment and title transfer of the tool 
from time to time  however  we allow customers to evaluate systems  and since customers can return such systems at any time with limited or no penalty  we do not recognize revenue until these evaluation systems are accepted by the customer 
revenues associated with sales to customers in japan are recognized upon customer acceptance  with the exception of sales of our rtp products through our distributor in japan  where revenues are recognized upon title transfer to the distributor 
for spare parts  revenue is recognized upon shipment 
service and maintenance contract revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the service period of the related contract 
revenues are difficult to predict  due in part to our reliance on customer acceptance before we recognize any revenue related to a significant number of our shipments 
any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter  and could result in future operating losses 
warranty 
our warranties require us to repair or replace defective products or parts  generally at a customer s site  during the warranty period at no cost to the customer 
the warranty offered on our systems ranges from months to months  depending on the product 
at the time of revenue recognition  a provision for the estimated cost of warranty is recorded as a cost of sales based on our historical costs 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions we have established  we cannot be certain that we will continue to experience the same warranty repair costs that we have in the past 
a significant increase in the costs to repair our products could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such additional costs materialize 
inventories 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on first in  first out basis 
due to changing market conditions  estimated future requirements  age of the inventories on hand and our introduction of new products  we regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand and declare obsolete inventories that are no longer used in current production 
accordingly  we write down our inventories to net realizable value 
actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such difference may result in write downs that have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize the decline in value in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
although we attempt to accurately forecast future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results  given the competitive pressures and cyclicality of the semiconductor industry 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we assess the realizability of goodwill and other intangible assets at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on changes in strategy  market conditions and operational performance of our business 
future events  including significant negative industry or economic trends  could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
impairment of long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of identified intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on changes in strategy  market conditions and operational performance of our business 
future events  including significant negative industry or economic trends  could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that long lived assets are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors  including discount rates and probability of cash flow scenarios  to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
see note in notes to the consolidated financial statements regarding fiscal impairment charges 
income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
this adjustment would increase income in the period such determination was made 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected consolidated financial data for the periods indicated  expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses research  development and engineering selling  general and administrative in process research and development amortization of goodwill and intangibles restructuring and other charges income loss from operations interest and other income  net income loss before provision benefit for income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle provision benefit for income taxes net income loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax net income loss years ended december  and net sales 
our net sales for the year ended december  were million  reflecting a decrease of million  or  compared to net sales of million for the year ended december  net sales for included approximately million of revenue from dns royalties 
net sales decreased in primarily due to lower demand and lower shipments as a result of the continuing economic downturn in the semiconductor industry 
shipments in declined by approximately compared to shipments in our total deferred revenue at december  was approximately million  which relates to tools shipped and awaiting customer acceptance  down million  from million deferred revenue at december  we generally expect deferred revenue from particular product sales to be recognized as revenue in our consolidated statement of operations with a time lag of six to twelve months from product shipment 
gross margin 
gross margin for the year ended december  was  an increase from gross margin of for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin in  compared to  was due to better absorption of our production facilities  improved manufacturing overhead efficiencies  royalty revenue recognized from dns with no associated cost of sales  and a decrease in inventory valuation charges related to the merger that adversely affected margins in inventory valuation charges in were million  a decrease  compared to million in acquisition related inventory costs  determined by accounting principles board opinion no 
apb business combinations  continued to effect us in  although to a lesser extent  as the inventory acquired in the merger was sold and recorded as cost of sales 
the inventory subject to these costs was revalued upward  to reflect its market value  at the time of the merger 
the difference between the original cost basis of the inventory and its allocated acquisition costs are our apb costs 
the largest portion of this revalued inventory related to our wet surface preparation products  as to which all revenue is deferred until we obtain customer acceptances 
the sold inventory of those wet products is being recognized as revenue as those products are accepted by customers  and the related costs  including apb costs  are included in our cost of goods sold  with an adverse effect on our gross margin in the corresponding quarter 
during  these apb costs were million  or of net sales 
during  the apb costs had been million  or of net sales 
as of december   we had approximately million of apb costs remaining in inventories delivered systems that will continue to have a negative impact on our future gross margins as the relevant systems are accepted 
due to intense competition we are continuing to face pricing pressure from competitors that is also affecting our gross margin 
in response  we are continuing with our cost reduction efforts and efforts to differentiate our product portfolio 
additionally  in light of the prolonged economic slowdown in our industry  we took steps to reduce the number of our manufacturing sites 
we have closed three manufacturing sites since the first quarter of  and sold two of those manufacturing sites during we continue to have excess capacity at our remaining sites but have reduced costs at those sites in an effort to improve our gross margin 
during the fourth quarter of  we ceased the wet products operations at our exton and malvern  pa facilities and transferred those operations to our wet products facility in pliezhausen  germany 
on march   we sold our wet products business to scp global technologies  a leading wet processing equipment provider 
the transaction involved the transfer of certain subsidiaries  assets and intellectual property related to the wet products division 
as part of the transaction  we will retain the rights to all future royalty and settlement payments under agreements with dainippon screen manufacturing co  ltd 
our gross margin has varied over the years and will continue to vary based on many factors  including competitive pressures  product mix  economies of scale  overhead absorption levels  remaining abp costs in our inventories and costs associated with the introduction of new products 
research  development and engineering 
research  development and engineering expenses were million  or of net sales  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the decrease in research  development and engineering expenses in was primarily due to the reduction of personnel and associated costs  more selective research and development project funding  and various cost control measures as a result of post merger product rationalization efforts that resulted in reduction in expenses for professional fees  outside services  licenses  and engineering materials 
our major research  development and engineering effort in was focused on the development of a new generation of mm rtp tools 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  for the year ended december   compared with million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily due to reduction in personnel and related expenses  lower bonus pay outs  fewer buildings  lower utilities  lower sales commissions  lower outside services  lower professional fees  lower repair maintenance  and lower travel expenses 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles 
upon adoption of sfas on january   we no longer amortize goodwill 
we continued to amortize the identified intangibles  and the amortization expense during was million 
in  we recorded amortization expense of million 
restructuring and other charges 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we performed assessments of the carrying values of our long lived assets to be held and used  including other intangible assets and property and equipment 
the assessment was performed pursuant to sfas no 
as a result of continuing deteriorated market conditions in the semiconductor industry in general  a reduced demand specifically for the rtp products and certain wet products  and revised projected cash flows for these products in the future 
as a result of these assessments  we recorded a charge of million to reduce the carrying value of intangible assets  other long term assets and property and equipment  as it was determined that the carrying amount of these assets exceeded the estimated future cash flows from the use of these assets 
the charge of million recorded includes million for impaired and abandoned property and equipment  million for write off of intangible assets for developed technology resulting from our concept systems acquisition and our wet business  and million for impairment of other long term assets 
interest and other income  net 
interest expense of million during was primarily related to interest on our notes payable to ses 
interest income of million primarily resulted from the investment of our cash balances during the year 
we also had net other income of million which primarily included dns settlement payments of million offset by approximately million foreign exchange loss 
in  interest expense of million was primarily related to interest on our notes payable to ses 
interest income of million resulted from the investment of our cash balances during the year 
we also had other income of million which included losses on sales of fixed assets of million and the remainder was due to foreign exchange gains 
provision for income taxes 
we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million for the year ended december   compared to a tax benefit of million for the year ended december  the tax benefit recorded in resulted from the release of the deferred tax liability recorded in conjunction with the purchase of the steag semiconductor division and cfm 
fasb statement no 
requires that a deferred tax liability be recorded to offset the tax impact of non deductible  identifiable intangible assets recorded as part of purchase accounting 
the deferred tax liability decreases proportionally to any amortization or write down of the identifiable intangibles 
the tax benefit recorded in is a result of amortization of the identifiable intangibles acquired in and the receipt of a federal tax refund 
these benefits were offset by tax expense related to foreign operations 
fasb statement no 
provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon available data  which includes our historical operating performance  we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset at december   as the future realization of the tax benefit is not sufficiently assured 
we intend to evaluate the realization of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
years ended december  and net sales 
our net sales for the year ended december  were million  compared to net sales of million for the year ended december  we estimated that on a pro forma basis for the year ended december   assuming that we had acquired the steag semiconductor division and cfm on january   the combined company would have had net sales of million  so that net sales in the year would reflect a decrease of from net sales decreased in primarily due to the economic downturn in the semiconductor industry and also due to the timing effects of revenue recognition  where the time lag between product shipment and customer acceptance can exceed one year 
a significant proportion of products shipped during fiscal and from our thermal and wet product divisions operations acquired from the steag semiconductor division and cfm resulted in deferred revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  due to the complexities of the equipment shipped and the associated acceptance clauses 
gross margin 
gross margin for the year ended december  was  a decrease from gross margin of for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin in was due to several factors 
our costs were adversely affected by the under absorption of our production facilities  leading to manufacturing overhead inefficiencies 
we had excess production capacity as a result of the drop in sales and bookings  combined with our acquisition of additional production capacity in germany and exton  pa as a result of the merger 
our gross margin in was also adversely affected by the write up of inventory acquired in the merger to fair value  as required by accounting principles board opinion no 
business combinations  in the amount of million  or percent of net sales 
in addition  our gross margin in was adversely affected by increased provisions for excess inventories that we believed would not be used based on our bookings or forecasted levels of sales  in the amount of million  or percent of net sales 
this provision largely covered inventories for rtp and wet products that were acquired in the merger 
research  development and engineering 
research  development and engineering expenses were million  or of net sales  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase in absolute dollars in was due to additional personnel and spending resulting from the merger 
the increase in research  development and engineering expense as a percentage of net sales in compared to was primarily attributable to decreased sales in during  major efforts were made with regard to the improvement of our product line of mm tools and the processes they are capable of running 
improvement of the reliability of the tools was a focal point for engineering in fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  for the year ended december   compared with million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase in absolute dollars in was due to additional personnel and spending added by the merger 
also in  the company incurred million of severance charges and million of bad debt charges recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in compared to was primarily attributable to decreased net sales in and the severance charge 
in process research and development 
in connection with our acquisition of the steag semiconductor division  we allocated approximately million of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
this allocation represented the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows relating to the incomplete research and development projects 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  the purchase price allocated to in process research and development was expensed as of the acquisition date 
in connection with the acquisition of cfm  we allocated approximately million of the purchase price to an in process research and development project 
this allocation represented the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to one incomplete research and development project 
at the date of acquisition  the development of this project had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the research and development in progress had no alternative future use 
accordingly  the purchase price allocated to in process research and development was expensed as of the acquisition date 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles 
goodwill and intangibles represent the purchase price of the steag semiconductor division and cfm in excess of identified tangible assets 
in connection with the merger  effective january   we recorded million of goodwill and intangible assets  which were being amortized on a straight line basis over three to seven years 
we recorded amortization expense of million for the year upon adoption of sfas on january   goodwill is no longer amortized  only the identified intangibles continue to be amortized 
impairment of long lived assets and other charges 
in  an independent third party performed assessments of the carrying values of our long lived assets to be held and used including goodwill  other intangible assets and property and equipment recorded in connection with our acquisitions of the steag semiconductor division and cfm 
the assessment was performed pursuant to sfas no 
as a result of deteriorated market conditions in the semiconductor industry in general  a reduced demand specifically for the rtp products and certain wet products acquired in the merger  and revised projected cash flows for these products in the future 
as a result of these assessments  we recorded a charge of million to reduce goodwill  intangible assets and property and equipment based on the amount by which the carrying value of these assets exceeded their fair value 
fair value was determined based on discounted future cash flows 
interest and other income  net 
interest expense of million was primarily related to interest on our notes payable to ses 
interest income of million resulted from the investment of our cash balances during the year 
we also had other income of million which included losses on sales of fixed assets of million and the remainder was due to foreign exchange gains 
for the year ended december   we earned interest income of million which was from the investment of the net proceeds from the sale of common stock in march provision for income taxes 
we recorded a tax benefit of million for the year ended december  compared to a tax provision of million for the year ended december  the tax benefit recorded in  resulted from the release of the deferred tax liability recorded in conjunction with the purchase of the steag semiconductor division and cfm 
fasb statement no 
requires that a deferred tax liability be recorded to offset the tax impact of non deductible identifiable intangible assets recorded as part of purchase accounting 
the deferred tax liability decreases proportionally to any amortization or write down of the identifiable intangibles 
we recognized a provision for income taxes at an effective tax rate of during  as we were able to recognize certain benefits from our prior operating losses 
fasb statement no 
provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon available data  which includes our historical operating performance  we provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset at december   as the future realization of the tax benefit is not sufficiently assured 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth our unaudited consolidated statements of operations data for each of the eight quarterly periods ended december  this information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
we have prepared this unaudited consolidated information on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements  reflecting all normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position and operating results for the quarters presented

on july   we timely retired two obligations  of million and million euros  including accrued interest thereon  and made payments in full to ses in the total amount of approximately million 
our japanese subsidiary has a credit facility with a japanese bank in the amount of million yen approximately million at december   secured by specific trade accounts receivable of our japanese subsidiary 
the facility bears interest at a per annum rate of tibor plus basis points 
the term of the facility is through june  we have given a corporate guarantee for this credit facility 
at december   there were no borrowings under this credit facility 
on march  we entered into a one year revolving line of credit with a bank in the amount of million 
the line of credit was due to expire on march   but has been extended for an interim period until april   while the credit line covenants are being modified to reflect changes in our business 
the line of credit is expected to be extended thereafter 
all borrowings under this line bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the bank s prime rate plus basis points 
the line of credit is secured by a blanket lien on all of our domestic assets including intellectual property 
the line of credit requires us to satisfy certain quarterly financial covenants  including maintaining a minimum quick ratio and minimum tangible net worth  and meeting minimum revenue targets 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants and there were no borrowings under this credit line 
on june   we entered into a settlement agreement and a cross license agreement with dns under which dns agreed to pay us a total of million  relating to past damages  partial reimbursement of attorney s fee and costs  and royalties  payable in varying amounts at varying dates through april   as follows million in  million in  and thereafter million each year from through the royalty obligations of dns would cease if all four patents that had been the subject of the lawsuit were to be held invalid by a court 
royalties payable under the cross license agreement total a minimum of million and a maximum million 
once total royalty payments equal million  the minimum royalties no longer apply 
no further royalties are payable once total payments reach million 
as of december   we had received payments aggregating million million  net  after deducting japanese withholding tax from dns under the terms of the settlement agreement

these loans are described in note net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the net cash used in operations in was primarily attributable to net losses of million  a decrease in deferred revenue of million  a decrease in accrued liabilities of million  and deferred taxes of million 
these uses of cash were offset by the decreases in inventories and inventories delivered systems of million  decreases in accounts receivable and advance billings of million  and a non cash impairment of long lived assets and other charges of million 
the net cash used in operations in  of million  was primarily attributable to the net loss of million and a decrease in accrued liabilities of million and accrued payables of million 
these uses of cash were offset by non cash impairment of long lived assets and other charges of million and depreciation and amortization of goodwill and intangibles of million  an increase in deferred revenue of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million  inventory valuation charges of million and acquired in process research and development charges of million

net cash provided by financing activities was million in  primarily resulting from million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and million in proceeds from stock plans  offset by the repayment of million against our line of credit 
based on current projections  we believe that our current cash and investment positions and available credit  together with cash provided by operations  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
our primary source of liquidity is our existing unrestricted cash balance and cash generated by our operations 
during  we had operating losses 
our operating plans are based on and require that we reduce our operating losses  control our expenses  manage our inventories  and collect our accounts receivable balances 
in this market downturn  we are exposed to a number of challenges and risks  including delays in payments of our accounts receivable by our customers  and postponements or cancellations of orders 
postponed or cancelled orders can cause us to have excess inventory and underutilized manufacturing capacity 
if we are not able to significantly reduce our present operating losses over the upcoming quarters  our operating losses could adversely affect our cash and working capital balances  and we may be required to seek additional sources of financing 
we may need to raise additional funds in future periods through public or private financing  or other sources  to fund our operations 
we may not be able to obtain adequate or favorable financing when needed 
failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be reduced  and these equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants on our operations and financial condition 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities sfas no 

sfas no 
addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for under eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the scope of sfas no 
also includes costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease and termination benefits that employees who are involuntarily terminated receive under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract 
since the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   the adoption of sfas no 
will have no effect on our current financial condition or result of operations 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements eitf 
eitf addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the consensus mandates how to identify whether goods or services or both which are to be delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be accounted for separately because they are separate units of accounting 
the guidance can affect the timing of revenue recognition for such arrangements  even though it does not change rules governing the timing or patterns of revenue recognition of individual items accounted for separately 
the final consensus will be applicable to agreements entered into in fiscal years beginning after june  with early adoption permitted 
additionally  companies will be permitted to apply the consensus guidance to all existing arrangements as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting changes 
the company is assessing  but at this point does not believe the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin will significantly change current practice in the accounting for  and disclosure of  guarantees 
fin requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value  which is different from the current practice of recording a liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable  as those terms are defined in sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
fin also requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures  even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote  which is another change from the current practice 
fin disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december   while the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of fin on our results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
the statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the company adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
on january  we do not anticipate that adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  the company believes that the adoption of this standard will have no material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
mergers  acquisitions and dispositions on june   we entered into a definitive strategic business combination agreement  subsequently amended on december  and november  combination agreement to acquire eleven direct and indirect subsidiaries comprising the semiconductor equipment division of steag electronic systems ag the steag semiconductor division  and we entered into an agreement and plan of merger plan of merger to acquire cfm technologies  inc cfm 
both transactions were completed simultaneously on january  under the combination agreement  we issued to steag electronic systems ag ses  shares of common stock  valued at approximately million as of the date of the amended combination agreement 
we also paid ses  in cash  and reimbursed ses million in acquisition related costs 
we also assumed certain obligations of ses and steag ag  the parent company of ses  and assumed certain intercompany indebtedness and obligations owed by the acquired subsidiaries to ses which were settled by the issuance of million shares to ses upon conversion of million of outstanding promissory notes at per share of common stock in a private placement transaction  on april   and we made payment in full  on july   in the total amount of approximately million  including accrued interest thereon 
the acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  and the results of operations of the steag semiconductor division are included in our consolidated statement of operations from the date of acquisition 
the purchase price of this acquisition was million  which included million of direct acquisition related costs including the amount reimbursed to ses 
as a result of our acquisition of the steag semiconductor division  ses holds approximately of our common stock and currently has two representatives on our board of directors 
under the plan of merger with cfm  we agreed to acquire cfm in a stock for stock merger in which we issued  shares of our common stock  valued at approximately million 
in addition  we assumed all outstanding cfm stock options  which resulted in our issuance of options to acquire  shares of our common stock  valued at approximately million 
the merger has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and the results of operations of cfm are included in our consolidated statement of operations from the date of acquisition 
the purchase price of the acquisition of cfm was million  which included million of direct acquisition related costs 
under the combination agreement and the plan of merger  we also agreed to grant options to purchase  shares of our common stock to employees of the steag semiconductor division and options to purchase  shares of our common stock to employees of cfm subsequent to the closing of the transactions 
these options are not included in the purchase price of the steag semiconductor division or cfm 
in april  we acquired of the outstanding shares of rf services  inc for a cash price of  including acquisition related costs of 
brad mattson  former chief executive officer of the company  owned a majority of the outstanding shares of rf services  inc and served as a director of that company 
on march   we sold the portion of our business that was engaged in developing  manufacturing  selling  and servicing wet surface preparation products for the cleaning and preparation of semiconductor wafers the wet business to scp global technologies  inc scp 
we had originally acquired the wet business on january   as part of our merger with the steag semiconductor division and cfm 
as part of this disposition  scp acquired certain subsidiaries and assets  and assumed certain contracts relating to the wet business  including the operating assets  customer contracts and inventory of cfm  all outstanding stock of mattson technology ip  inc mattson ip  a subsidiary that owns various patents relating to the wet business  and all equity ownership interest in mattson wet products gmbh  a subsidiary in germany that owned our principal wet business operations 
we retained all the cash from the wet business entities  and we retained all rights to payments under the settlement and license agreements with dns 
scp acquired the rights to any damages under pending patent litigation relating to patents owned by mattson ip 
scp assumed responsibility for the operations  sales  marketing and technical support services for our former wet product lines worldwide 
the initial purchase price paid to us by scp to acquire the wet business was million in cash 
that initial purchase price is subject to adjustment based on a number of things  including the net working capital of the wet business at closing  to be determined based on a pro forma post closing balance sheet  and an earn out payable to us  up to an aggregate maximum of million  based upon sales by scp of certain products to identified customers through december  we expect the purchase price adjustment based on the net working capital at closing to result in a payment to scp  in an amount less than million 
we are obligated to i fund salary and severance costs relating to reductions in force to be implemented in germany after the closing  ii assume certain real property leases relating to transferred facilities  subject to a sublease to scp  iii reimburse scp for future legal fees  up to a maximum of million  in pending patent litigations  and iv reimburse scp for amounts necessary to cover specified customer responsibilities 
we expect to reserve approximately million to million to cover our potential liability under these items 
risk factors that may affect future results and market price of stock the semiconductor equipment industry is cyclical  is currently experiencing a severe and prolonged downturn  and causes our operating results to fluctuate significantly 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns  whether the result of general economic changes or capacity growth temporarily exceeding growth in demand for semiconductor devices 
during periods of declining demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment  customers typically reduce purchases  delay delivery of products and or cancel orders 
increased price competition may result  causing pressure on our net sales  gross margin and net income 
we are experiencing cancellations  delays and push outs of orders  which reduce our revenues  cause delays in our ability to recognize revenue on the orders and reduce backlog 
further order cancellations  reductions in order size or delays in orders will materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
following the very strong year in  the semiconductor industry is now  since  in the midst of a significant and prolonged downturn  and we and other industry participants are experiencing lower bookings  significant push outs and cancellations of orders 
the severity and duration of the downturn are unknown  but is impairing our ability to sell our systems and to operate profitably 
if demand for semiconductor devices and our systems remains depressed for an extended period  it will seriously harm our business 
as a result of the acquisition of the steag semiconductor division and cfm at the beginning of  we grew to be a larger  more geographically diverse company  less able to react quickly to the cyclicality of the semiconductor business  particularly in europe and other regions where restrictive laws relating to termination of employees prohibited us from quickly reducing costs in order to meet the downturn 
accordingly  during this latest downturn we have been unable to reduce our expenses quickly enough to avoid incurring a loss 
for the fiscal year ended december  and  our net loss was million and million  respectively  compared to net income of million for the year ended december  the net loss in primarily reflected the impact of our continuing decline in net sales 
subsequent to december   we have sold the wet business to scp  which business had originally been acquired as part of our acquisition of the steag semiconductor division and cfm 
if our actions to date  including our recent sale to scp of the wet business  are insufficient to effectively align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions we may be required to undertake additional cost cutting measures  and may be unable to continue to invest in marketing  research and development and engineering at the levels we believe are necessary to maintain our competitive position in our remaining core businesses 
our failure to make these investments could seriously harm our long term business prospects 
we are exposed to the risks associated with industry overcapacity  including reduced capital expenditures  decreased demand for our products and the inability of many of our customers to pay for our products 
as a result of the recent economic downturn  inventory buildups in telecommunication products and slower than expected personal computer sales have resulted in overcapacity of semiconductor devices and has caused semiconductor manufacturers to experience cash flow problems and reduce their capital spending 
as our business depends in significant part upon capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductor devices  including manufacturers that open new or expand existing facilities  continued overcapacity and reductions in capital expenditures by our customers could cause further delays or decreased demand for our products 
if existing fabrication facilities are not expanded or new facilities are not built  demand for our systems may not develop or increase  and we may be unable to generate significant new orders for our systems 
if we are unable to develop new orders for our systems  we will not achieve anticipated net sales levels 
in addition  many semiconductor manufacturers are continuing to forecast that revenues in the short term will remain flat or lower than in previous high demand years  and we believe that we may continue to see some customers experiencing cash flow problems 
as a result  if customers are not successful generating sufficient revenue or securing alternative financing arrangements  we may be unable to close sales or collect accounts receivables from such customers or potential customers  and may be required to take additional reserves against our accounts receivables 
we are implementing new financial systems  and will need to continue to improve or implement new systems  procedures and controls 
we are implementing new financial systems used in the consolidation of our financial results  in order to further automate processes and align the disparate systems used by our acquired businesses 
the integration of the steag semiconductor division and cfm and their operational and financial systems and controls after the merger in placed a significant strain on our management information systems and our administrative  operational and financial resources  requiring us to improve our systems and implement new operational and financial systems  procedures and controls 
since that acquisition  we have been pursuing integration of the businesses  systems and controls of the three companies  as each business historically used a different financial system 
we have recently implemented new financial systems to aid in the consolidation of our financial reporting operations 
these financial systems are new and not yet fully operational  and we have not had extensive experience with them 
we may encounter unexpected difficulties  costs or other challenges that make implementation and use of these systems more difficult or costly than expected  may cause the consolidation and reporting of our financial results to be more time consuming than expected  and may require additional management resources than expected before they are fully implemented and operating smoothly 
in addition  the sale of our wet business to scp will continue to place a significant strain on our management information systems and our administrative  operational and financial resources as we separate out the wet business as a discontinued operation from our core businesses 
continued improvement or implementation of new systems  procedures and controls may be required  and could cause us to incur additional costs  and place further burdens on our management and internal resources 
if our new financial systems do not result in the expected improvements  or if we are unable to fully implement these systems  procedures and controls in a timely manner  our business could be harmed 
in addition  as a result of new requirements proposed by the securities and exchange commission  in response to the passage of the sarbanes oxley act of  requiring annual review and evaluation of our internal control systems  and attestation of these systems by our independent auditors  we are currently reviewing our internal control procedures  and working with our auditors to implement any enhancements of such procedures  or further documentation of such procedures  that may be necessary 
any improvements in our internal control systems or in documentation of such internal control systems could be costly to prepare or implement  divert attention of management or finance staff  and may cause our operating expenses to increase over the ensuing year 
the sale of our wet business to scp may fail to result in the benefits we anticipate  and may cause us to incur greater costs than anticipated 
we may not obtain the benefits we expect as a result of the sale of the wet business to scp  such as greater strategic focus on our core businesses 
our agreement with scp may require an adjustment to the initial purchase price  if the net working capital of the wet business after the sale is not within a specified range  and could result in a reduction of the purchase price to us 
we expect the purchase price adjustment based on the net working capital at closing to result in a payment to scp  in an amount less than million 
we have agreed with scp to i fund salary and severance costs for certain reductions in force to be implemented in germany after the closing  ii assume real property leases relating to our former pliezhausen facilities  subject to a sublease of all or a portion of such facilities to scp  iii pay legal fees up to a maximum of million in connection with certain pending patent litigation  and iv reimburse scp for amounts to cover specified arrangements and responsibilities with customers and other costs 
we expect to record reserves in the aggregate amount of approximately million to million to cover our potential liability under these items 
however  our actual costs and expenses could be greater or lesser than expected  and if greater  could materially adversely affect our results of operation in future periods 
in addition  our consolidated financial statements do not reflect what our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would have been had the wet business been a separate stand alone entity during the periods presented 
therefore  we cannot predict with certainty what the effects of the divestiture might be on ongoing operations and results  and whether the expected cost savings will materialize  or whether the transaction may have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows taken as a whole  or whether the transaction will contribute to our financial results differently from the investment community s expectations 
our divestiture of the wet business may also result in the cancellation of orders by customers who may be unhappy that we are discontinuing the product line  particularly if the customer has previously purchased wet processing products from us 
we may lose future orders if customers are wary or unsure of our long term plans  or become concerned that we will discontinue other product lines  or they elect to purchase products from suppliers that appear to have a broader product offering 
customers of our wet processing products may attempt to return the products if they fear that ongoing maintenance and support of the product will not be available 
the divestiture may also prove more costly or difficult than expected  could cause us to lose key employees  and divert management attention and resources from our other core businesses  particularly over the next several quarters 
in addition to the employees and facilities transferred to scp as part of the divestiture  we are shutting down other facilities in the united states previously devoted largely to the wet business  and terminating additional employees not hired by scp who had predominantly worked in the wet business 
in order to achieve the desired cost savings from the divestiture  we will need to incur substantial restructuring costs  including severance costs associated with headcount reductions  and asset write offs associated with manufacturing and facility closures 
we may incur additional costs associated with the discontinued operations  and the dedication of management resources to the sale has distracted and may continue to distract attention from our remaining core businesses 
we may incur additional costs associated with these activities  which could materially reduce our short term earnings 
our results of operations may suffer if we do not effectively manage our inventory 
to achieve commercial success with our product lines  we will need to manage our inventory of component parts and finished goods effectively to meet changing customer requirements 
some of our products and supplies have in the past and may in the future become obsolete while in inventory due to rapidly changing customer specifications 
if we are not successfully able to manage our inventory  including our spare parts inventory  we may need to write off unsaleable or obsolete inventory  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
warranty claims in excess of our projections could seriously harm our business 
we offer a warranty on our products 
the cost associated with our warranty is significant  and in the event our projections and estimates of this cost are inaccurate our financial performance could be seriously harmed 
in addition  if we experienced product failures at an unexpectedly high level  our reputation in the marketplace could be damaged  customers may decline to place new or additional orders with us  and our business would suffer 
we may need additional capital  which may not be available and which could be dilutive to existing stockholders 
based on current projections  we believe that our current cash and investments along with cash generated through operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the next months 
management s projections are based on our ability to manage inventories and collect accounts receivable balances in this market downturn 
if we are unable to manage our inventories or accounts receivable balances  or if we otherwise experience higher operating costs or lower revenue than we anticipate  we may be required to seek alternative sources of financing 
we may need to raise additional funds in future periods through public or private financing or other sources to fund our operations 
we may not be able to obtain adequate or favorable financing when needed 
if we fail to raise capital when needed  we would be unable to continue operating our business as we plan  or at all 
in addition  we may need to continue reducing costs  which could cause us to curtail research and development activities  resulting in a delay in new product introduction or enhancement 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be reduced 
in addition  any future equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock 
furthermore  debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants on our operations 
accounting guidance under sab may result in wide fluctuation in our revenue 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab provides guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition issues in financial statements 
among other things  sab has resulted in a change from the established practice of recognizing revenue at the time of shipment of a system  and instead delaying revenue recognition in part or totally until the time of customer acceptance 
we adopted sab effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal  retroactive to january   with the impact recorded as a cumulative effect in the first quarter of in some situations  application of this accounting guidance delays the recognition of revenue that would otherwise have been recognized in earlier periods 
as a result  our reported revenue may fluctuate more widely and reported revenue for a particular fiscal period might not meet the expectations of financial analysts or investors 
a delay in recognition of revenue resulting from application of this guidance  while not affecting our cash flow  could adversely affect our results of operations  which could cause the value of our common stock to fall 
we depend on large purchases from a few customers  and any loss  cancellation  reduction or delay in purchases by  or failure to collect receivables from  these customers could harm our business 
currently  we derive most of our revenues from the sale of a relatively small number of systems to a relatively small number of customers  which makes our relationship with each customer critical to our business 
the list prices on our systems range from  to over million 
our lengthy sales cycle for each system  coupled with customers capital budget considerations  make the timing of customer orders uneven and difficult to predict 
in addition  our backlog at the beginning of a quarter is not expected to include all orders required to achieve our sales objectives for that quarter 
as a result  our net sales and operating results for a quarter depend on our ability to ship orders as scheduled during that quarter as well as obtain new orders for systems to be shipped in that same quarter 
any delay in scheduled shipments or in acceptances of shipped products would delay our ability to recognize revenue  collect outstanding accounts receivable  and would materially adversely affect our operating results for that quarter 
a delay in a shipment or customer acceptance near the end of a quarter may cause net sales in that quarter to fall below our expectations and the expectations of market analysts or investors 
our list of major customers changes substantially from year to year  and we cannot predict whether a major customer in one year will make significant purchases from us in future years 
accordingly  it is difficult for us to accurately forecast our revenues and operating results from year to year 
if we are unable to collect a receivable from a large customer  our financial results will be negatively impacted 
our quarterly operating results fluctuate significantly and are difficult to predict  and may fall short of anticipated levels  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly revenue and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future  which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results 
this fluctuation is due to a number of factors  including o cyclicality of the semiconductor industry  o delays  cancellations and push outs of orders by our customers  o delayed product acceptance or payments of invoices by our customers  o size and timing of sales  shipments and acceptance of our products  o entry of new competitors into our market  or the announcement of new products or product enhancements by competitors  o sudden changes in component prices or availability  o variability in the mix of products sold  o manufacturing inefficiencies caused by uneven or unpredictable order patterns  reducing our gross margins  o higher fixed costs due to increased levels of research and development costs  and o successful expansion of our worldwide sales and marketing organization 
a substantial percentage of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term and we may be unable to adjust spending to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in revenues 
as a result  any delay in generating or recognizing revenues could cause our operating results to be below the expectations of market analysts or investors  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
we incurred net operating losses for the fiscal years   and we may not achieve or maintain profitability on an annual basis  and if we do not  we may not utilize deferred tax assets 
we incurred net losses of approximately million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  we expect to continue to incur significant research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses and may not return to profitability in we will need to generate significant increases in net sales to achieve and maintain profitability on an annual basis  and we may not be able to do so 
in addition  our ability to realize our deferred tax assets in future periods will depend on our ability to achieve and maintain profitability on an annual basis 
as a result of the industry downturn  we have implemented restructuring and workforce reductions  which may adversely affect the morale and performance of our personnel and our ability to hire new personnel 
in connection with our efforts to streamline operations  reduce costs and bring our staffing and structure in line with current demand for our products  during we restructured our organization and reduced our workforce by positions 
we have incurred costs of million associated with the workforce reduction related to severance and other employee related costs in  and may incur further costs if additional restructuring is needed to right size our business further or bring our costs down to respond to continued industry and economic slowdowns 
our restructuring may also yield unanticipated consequences  such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce and loss of employee morale and decreased performance 
the effects of the restructuring may be further exacerbated by our sale of the wet business to scp  which involved the transfer or termination of employment of our employees engaged in the wet business 
in addition  the recent trading levels of our common stock have decreased the value of our stock options granted to employees pursuant to our stock option plan 
as a result of these factors  our remaining personnel may seek employment with larger  more established companies or companies they perceive as having less volatile operations or stock prices 
continuity of personnel can be an important factor in the successful sales of our products and completion of our development projects in our ongoing core businesses  and ongoing turnover in our sales and research and development personnel could materially and adversely impact our sales  development and marketing efforts 
we believe that hiring and retaining qualified individuals at all levels is essential to our success  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining the necessary personnel 
our lengthy sales cycle increases our costs and reduces the predictability of our revenue 
sales of our systems depend upon the decision of a prospective customer to increase or replace manufacturing capacity  typically involving a significant capital commitment 
accordingly  the decision to purchase our systems requires time consuming internal procedures associated with the evaluation  testing  implementation  and introduction of new technologies into our customers manufacturing facilities 
potential new customers evaluate the need to acquire new semiconductor manufacturing equipment infrequently 
even after the customer determines that our systems meet their qualification criteria  we experience delays finalizing system sales while the customer obtains approval for the purchase and constructs new facilities or expands its existing facilities 
we may expend significant sales and marketing expenses during this evaluation period 
the time between our first contact with a customer regarding a specific potential purchase and the customer s placing its first order may last from nine to twelve months or longer 
in this difficult economic climate  the average sales cycle has lengthened even further and is expected to continue to make it difficult to accurately forecast future sales 
if sales forecasted from a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized  we may experience an unplanned shortfall in revenues and our quarterly and annual revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
we are highly dependent on our international sales  and face significant economic and regulatory risks because a majority of our net sales are from outside the united states 
asia has been a particularly important region for our business  and we anticipate that it will continue to be important as we expand our sales and marketing efforts by opening an office in china 
our sales to customers located in taiwan  japan  other asian countries and recently china accounted for of our total sales in  in and in during  europe also emerged as an important region for our business 
during  and  sales to customers in europe accounted for  and  respectively 
our international sales accounted for of our total net sales in  in and in and we anticipate international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our future net sales 
because of our continuing dependence upon international sales  however  we are subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities  including o unexpected changes in law or regulations resulting in more burdensome governmental controls  tariffs  restrictions  embargoes  or export license requirements  o exchange rate volatility  o the need to comply with a wide variety of foreign and us export laws  o political and economic instability  particularly in asia  o differing labor regulations  o reduced protection for intellectual property  o difficulties in accounts receivable collections  o difficulties in managing distributors or representatives  o difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations  and o changes in tariffs or taxes 
in the us  our sales to date have been denominated primarily in us dollars  while our sales in japan are usually denominated in japanese yen 
our sales to date in europe have been denominated in various currencies  currently primarily us dollars and the euro 
our sales in foreign currencies are subject to risks of currency fluctuation 
for us dollar sales in foreign countries  our products become less price competitive where the local currency is declining in value compared to the dollar 
this could cause us to lose sales or force us to lower our prices  which would reduce our gross margins 
in addition  we are exposed to the risks of operating a global business  and maintain certain manufacturing facilities in germany 
managing our global operations presents challenges  including varying business conditions and demands  political instability  export restrictions and fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
we may not achieve anticipated revenue growth if we are not selected as vendor of choice for new or expanded fabrication facilities or if our systems and products do not achieve broader market acceptance 
because semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to install and integrate capital equipment into a semiconductor fabrication facility  these manufacturers will tend to choose semiconductor equipment manufacturers based on established relationships  product compatibility  and proven financial performance 
once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular vendor s capital equipment  the manufacturer generally relies for a significant period of time upon equipment from this vendor of choice for the specific production line application 
in addition  the semiconductor manufacturer frequently will attempt to consolidate its other capital equipment requirements with the same vendor 
accordingly  we may face narrow windows of opportunity to be selected as the vendor of choice by substantial new customers 
it may be difficult for us to sell to a particular customer for a significant period of time once that customer selects a competitor s product  and we may not be successful in obtaining broader acceptance of our systems and technology 
if we are unable to achieve broader market acceptance of our systems and technology  we may be unable to grow our business and our operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected 
unless we can continue to develop and introduce new systems that compete effectively on the basis of price and performance  we may lose future sales and customers  our business may suffer  and our stock price may decline 
because of continual changes in the markets in which our customers and we compete  our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue to improve our systems and technologies 
these markets are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  and continuous improvements in products and services 
due to the continual changes in these markets  our success will also depend upon our ability to develop new technologies and systems that compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and that adequately address customer requirements 
in addition  we must adapt our systems and processes to support emerging target market industry standards 
the success of any new systems we introduce is dependent on a number of factors  including timely completion of new system designs accepted by the market  and may be adversely affected by manufacturing inefficiencies and the challenge of producing systems in volume which meet customer requirements 
we may not be able to improve our existing systems or develop new technologies or systems in a timely manner 
in particular  the transition of the market to mm wafers will present us with both an opportunity and a risk 
to the extent that we are unable to introduce mm systems that meet customer requirements on a timely basis  our business could be harmed 
we may exceed the budgeted cost of reaching our research  development and engineering objectives  and estimated product development schedules may require extension 
any delays or additional development costs could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
because of the complexity of our systems  significant delays can occur between the introduction of systems or system enhancements and the commencement of commercial shipments 
the timing of the transition to mm technology is uncertain and competition may be intense 
we have invested  and are continuing to invest  substantial resources to develop new systems and technologies to automate the processing of mm wafers 
however  the timing of the industry s transition to mm manufacturing technology is uncertain  partly as a result of the recent period of reduced demand for semiconductors 
delay in the transition to mm manufacturing technology could adversely affect our potential revenues and opportunities for future growth 
moreover  delay in the transition to mm technology could permit our competitors to introduce competing or superior mm products at more competitive prices  causing competition to become more vigorous 
delays or technical and manufacturing difficulties incurred in the introduction of new products could be costly and adversely affect our customer relationships 
from time to time  we have experienced delays in the introduction of  and certain technical and manufacturing difficulties with  certain systems and enhancements  and may experience such delays and technical and manufacturing difficulties in future introductions or volume production of new systems or enhancements 
for example  our inability to overcome such difficulties  to meet the technical specifications of any new systems or enhancements  or to manufacture and ship these systems or enhancements in volume and in a timely manner  would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations  as well as our customer relationships 
in addition  we may from time to time incur unanticipated costs to ensure the functionality and reliability of our products early in their life cycles  which costs can be substantial 
if new products or enhancements experience reliability or quality problems  we could encounter a number of difficulties  including reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs  delays in collection of accounts receivable  and additional service and warranty expenses  all of which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we may not be able to continue to successfully compete in the highly competitive semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor equipment industry is both highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
significant competitive factors include the following o system performance  o cost of ownership  o size of installed base  o breadth of product line  and o customer support 
the following characteristics of our major competitors systems may give them a competitive advantage over us o broader product lines  o longer operating history  o greater experience with high volume manufacturing  o broader name recognition  o substantially larger customer bases  and o substantially greater financial  technical  and marketing resources 
in addition  to expand our sales we must often replace the systems of our competitors or sell new systems to customers of our competitors 
our competitors may develop new or enhanced competitive products that will offer price or performance features that are superior to our systems 
our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sale of their product lines 
we may not be able to maintain or expand our sales if competition increases and we are unable to respond effectively 
we depend upon a limited number of suppliers for some components and subassemblies  and supply shortages or the loss of these suppliers could result in increased cost or delays in manufacture and sale of our products 
we rely to a substantial extent on outside vendors to manufacture many of the components and subassemblies of our systems 
we obtain some of these components and subassemblies from a sole source or a limited group of suppliers 
because of our anticipated reliance on outside vendors generally  and on a sole or a limited group of suppliers in particular  we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of required components 
although we currently experience minimal delays in receiving goods from our suppliers  when demand for semiconductor equipment is strong  as it was in  our suppliers strained to provide components on a timely basis 
in addition  during periods of shortages of components  we may have reduced control over pricing and timely delivery of components 
we often quote prices to our customers and accept customer orders for our products prior to purchasing components and subassemblies from our suppliers 
if our suppliers increase the cost of components or subassemblies  we may not have alternative sources of supply and may no longer be able to increase the cost of the system being evaluated by our customers to cover all or part of the increased cost of components 
the manufacture of some of these components and subassemblies is an extremely complex process and requires long lead times 
as a result  we have in the past and we may in the future experience delays or shortages 
if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required components or subassemblies  we may have to seek alternative sources of supply or manufacture such components internally 
this could delay our ability to manufacture or timely ship our systems  causing us to lose sales  incur additional costs  delay new product introductions  and harm our reputation 
we are highly dependent on our key personnel to manage our business and their knowledge of our business  management skills  and technical expertise would be difficult to replace 
our success will depend to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers  our current management and our technical staff  any of whom would be difficult to replace 
we have had significant turnover among our executive officers and key employees  and several have recently joined us or have assumed new responsibilities at the company 
the addition  reassignment or loss of key employees could limit or delay our ability to develop new products and adapt existing products to our customers evolving requirements and result in lost sales and diversion of management resources 
because of competition for additional qualified personnel  we may not be able to recruit or retain necessary personnel  which could impede development or sales of our products 
our growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified  experienced employees 
there is substantial competition for experienced engineering  technical  financial  sales  and marketing personnel in our industry 
in particular  we must attract and retain highly skilled design and process engineers 
historically  competition for such personnel has been intense in all of our locations  but particularly in the san francisco bay area where our headquarters is located 
if we are unable to retain existing key personnel  or attract and retain additional qualified personnel  we may from time to time experience inadequate levels of staffing to develop and market our products and perform services for our customers 
as a result  our growth could be limited due to our lack of capacity to develop and market our products to our customers  or we could fail to meet our delivery commitments or experience deterioration in service levels or decreased customer satisfaction 
if the current downturn ends suddenly  we may not have enough personnel to promptly return to our previous production levels 
if we are unable to expand our existing manufacturing capacity to meet demand  a customer s placement of a large order for our products during a particular period might deter other customers from placing similar orders with us for the same period 
it could be difficult for us to rapidly recruit and train substantial numbers of qualified technical personnel to meet increased demand 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  we may lose a valuable asset  experience reduced market share  and efforts to protect our intellectual property may require additional costly litigation 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademark and trade secret laws  non disclosure agreements  and other intellectual property protection methods to protect our proprietary technology 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property  our competitors may be able to legitimately ascertain the non patented proprietary technology embedded in our systems 
if this occurs  we may not be able to prevent the use of such technology 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  any patents owned by us could be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented and any rights granted under any patent may not provide adequate protection to us 
furthermore  we may not have sufficient resources to protect our rights 
our competitors may independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products  or design around patents that may be issued to us 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states and it may be more difficult to monitor the use of our products in such foreign countries 
as a result of these threats to our proprietary technology  we may have to resort to costly litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights 
we had been litigating certain matters involving our wet business intellectual property  which has been sold to scp 
although scp has assumed the responsibility for these legal proceedings  we remain a party to these litigations  and we have agreed to reimburse scp for the costs of such litigation up to the amount of million 
we might face intellectual property infringement claims that may be costly to resolve and could divert management attention including the potential for patent infringement litigation as a result of our increased market strength in rtp 
we may from time to time be subject to claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights 
competitors alleging infringement of such competitors patents have in the past sued our acquired company  steag semiconductor division 
although all such historic lawsuits have been settled or terminated  the risk of further intellectual property litigation for us may be increased following the expansion of our business after the merger 
our involvement in any patent dispute or other intellectual property dispute or action to protect trade secrets  even if the claims are without merit  could be very expensive to defend and could divert the attention of our management 
adverse determinations in any litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require us to seek costly licenses from third parties  and prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products 
royalty or license agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
any of these situations could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results in one or more countries 
our failure to comply with environmental regulations could result in substantial liability 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state  local  and foreign laws  rules  and regulations relating to environmental protection 
these laws  rules  and regulations govern the use  storage  discharge  and disposal of hazardous chemicals during manufacturing  research and development and sales demonstrations 
if we fail to comply with present or future regulations  we could be subject to substantial liability for clean up efforts  personal injury  and fines or suspension or cessation of our operations 
we may be subject to liability if our acquired companies have past violations 
restrictions on our ability to expand or continue to operate our present locations could be imposed upon us or we could be required to acquire costly remediation equipment or incur other significant expenses 
future sales of shares by steag could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
there are approximately million shares of our common stock outstanding as of december   of which approximately million or are held beneficially by steag 
steag has agreed to restrictions on its ability to acquire additional shares of our stock  other than to maintain its percentage ownership in us  and from soliciting proxies and certain other standstill restrictions in connection with voting shares of our common stock  for a period of five years after its acquisition of the stock 
steag may sell these shares in the public markets from time to time  subject to certain limitations on the timing  amount and method of such sales imposed by sec regulations  and steag has the right to require us to register for resale all or a portion of the shares they hold 
if steag were to sell a large number of shares  the market price of our common stock could decline 
moreover  the perception in the public markets that such sales by steag might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future  which may lead to losses by investors or to securities litigation 
the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile in the past  and our stock price may decline in the future 
we believe that a number of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially  including o general conditions in the semiconductor industry or in the worldwide economy  o announcements of developments related to our business  o fluctuations in our operating results and order levels  o announcements of technological innovations by us or by our competitors  o new products or product enhancements by us or by our competitors  o developments in patent litigation or other intellectual property rights  or o developments in our relationships with our customers  distributors  and suppliers 
in addition  in recent years the stock market in general  and the market for shares of high technology stocks in particular  have experienced extreme price fluctuations 
these fluctuations have frequently been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
such fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against a company following periods of volatility in its stock price 
this type of litigation  if filed against us  could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources 
any future business acquisitions may disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value  or distract management attention 
as part of our ongoing business strategy  we may consider additional acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses that offer products  services  and technologies complementary to our own 
such acquisitions could materially adversely affect our operating results and or the price of our common stock 
acquisitions also entail numerous risks  including o difficulty of assimilating the operations  products  and personnel of the acquired businesses  o potential disruption of our ongoing business  o unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition  o inability of management to manage the financial and strategic position of acquired or developed products  services  and technologies  o inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  policies  and procedures  and o impairment of relationships with employees and customers that may occur as a result of integration of the acquired business 
to the extent that shares of our stock or other rights to purchase stock are issued in connection with any future acquisitions  dilution to our existing stockholders will result and our earnings per share may suffer 
any future acquisitions may not generate additional revenue or provide any benefit to our business  and we may not achieve a satisfactory return on our investment in any acquired businesses 
the effect of terrorism  the war in iraq  and political instability could harm our results of operation 
the threat of terrorism targeted at the regions of the world in which we do business  including the united states  increases the uncertainty in our markets and may delay any recovery in the general economy 
any delay in the recovery of the economy and the semiconductor industry could seriously impact our business 
increased international political instability  as demonstrated by the september terrorist attacks  disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of the terrorist attacks  and the effects of war in iraq  may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations 
such continuing instability could cause us to incur increased costs in transportation  make such transportation unreliable  increase our insurance costs  and cause international currency markets to fluctuate 
this same instability could have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products 
if this international political instability continues or increases  our business and results of operations could be harmed 
item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
we have no cash flow exposure due to rate changes for cash equivalents and short term investments  as all of these investments are at fixed interest rates 
the table below presents the fair value of principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio as of december  fair value december  in thousands assets cash and cash equivalents  average interest rate restricted cash  average interest rate foreign currency risk we are primarily a us dollar functional currency entity 
we transact business in various foreign countries and employ a foreign currency hedging program  utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts  to hedge foreign currency fluctuations associated with the japanese yen  korean won  singapore dollar and taiwan dollar 
our subsidiaries in germany are euro functional currency entities and they also employ foreign currency hedging programs  utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts  to hedge foreign currency fluctuations associated with the us dollar and japanese yen 
the goal of the hedging program is to lock in exchange rates to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
we do not use foreign currency forward exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
the following table provides information as of december  about us and our subsidiaries derivative financial instruments  which are comprised of foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
the information is provided in us dollar and euro equivalent amounts  as listed below
