income taxes the effective income tax rate for was  compared with in and in the rate reduction in is due to the favorable impact of eliminating goodwill amortization  corporate structure changes  changes in tax regulations  and a benefit for the recent resolution of various matters 
impact of inflation inflation did not have a material impact on our net sales and earnings 
we value inventory principally on a lifo basis  and as a result the current cost of merchandise is reflected in current operating results 
review of financial condition return on equity return on equity is our principal measure for evaluating our performance for shareowners and our ability to invest shareowners funds profitably 
excluding division combination costs  return on beginning equity was in  compared with in and in including division combination costs  return on beginning equity was in return on net assets return on net assets measures performance independent of capital structure 
return on net assets is pretax earnings before net interest expense and the interest component of operating leases  divided by beginning of year net assets including present value of operating leases 
excluding division combination costs  return on net assets was in  compared with in and in including division combination costs  return on net assets was in cash flows cash flows from operations was billion in this compares with billion in and billion in the decrease in cash flows from operations in related primarily to the decrease in earnings 
sources uses of cash flows were dollars in millions net earnings depreciation and amortization working capital increases decreases other operating activities cash flows from operations    net capital expenditures business combinations cash flows used for investing activities  net long term debt issuances repayments net short term debt issuances net purchases of common stock dividend payments cash flows used for financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents see consolidated statements of cash flows on page capital expenditures in  capital expenditures were primarily made for new stores  remodels  and expansions 
our strong financial condition enables us to make capital expenditures to enhance growth and improve operations 
the operating measures we emphasize when we invest in new stores and remodel or expand existing stores include return on net assets  internal rate of return  and net sales per square foot 
the capital expenditures include the purchase of former wards and bradlees stores 
these stores are operating as new store or expansions to existing stores 
business combinations in the fourth quarter of  we acquired after hours and priscilla of boston for an aggregate cost of million 
in march  we purchased nine department stores in the tennessee and louisiana markets from saks incorporated for approximately million 
in august  david s bridal joined may 
the cost of this transaction was approximately million 
these business combinations were accounted for as purchases 
liquidity  available credit  and debt ratings we finance our activities primarily with cash flows from operations  borrowings under credit facilities  and issuances of long term debt 
we have billion of credit under unsecured revolving facilities consisting of a million multi year credit agreement expiring july   and a million day credit agreement expiring july  these credit agreements support our commercial paper borrowings 
as of february   there was million of commercial paper outstanding 
financial covenants under the credit agreements include a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum debt to capitalization ratio 
we also maintain a million credit facility with a group of minority owned banks 
in addition  we have filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission that enables us to issue up to million of debt securities 
annual maturities of long term debt  including sinking fund requirements  are million  million  million  million  and million for through interest payments on long term debt are typically paid on a semi annual basis 
as of march   our bonds are rated a by moody s investors service  inc and a by standard poor s corporation 
our commercial paper is rated p by moody s and a by standard poor s 
our senior unsecured bank credit agreement is rated a by moody s 
off balance sheet financing we do not sell or securitize customer accounts receivable 
we have not entered into off balance sheet financing or other arrangements with any special purpose entity 
our existing operating leases do not contain any significant termination payments if lease options are not exercised 
the present value of operating leases minimum rents was million as of february  financial ratios our debt to capitalization and fixed charge coverage ratios are consistent with our capital structure objective 
our capital structure provides us with substantial financial and operational flexibility 
the debt to capitalization ratios were   and for   and  respectively 
for purposes of the debt to capitalization ratio  we define total debt as short term and long term debt including the employee stock ownership plan 
esop 
debt reduced by unearned compensation and the capitalized value of all leases  including operating leases 
we define capitalization as total debt  noncurrent deferred taxes  esop preference shares  and shareowners equity 
see profit sharing on page for discussion of the esop 
the fixed charge coverage ratios were x in  x in  and x in the ratio decline in was due to lower operating earnings  compared with  and division combination costs 
the ratio excluding division combination costs was x in the ratio declined in because of lower operating earnings and higher interest expense  compared with employee stock options effective february   we began expensing the fair value of employee stock options 
we adopted the fair value method prospectively 
the expense associated with stock options is expected to be per share in  growing to approximately per share by common stock dividends and market prices our dividend policy is based on earnings growth and capital investment requirements 
we increased the annual dividend by to per share effective with the march dividend 
this is our th consecutive annual dividend increase 
we have paid consecutive quarterly dividends since the quarterly price ranges of the common stock and dividends per share in and were market price market price dividends dividends quarter high low per share high low per share first second third fourth year the approximate number of common shareowners as of march   was  critical accounting policies in  approximately of our net sales were made under our department store credit programs  which resulted in customer accounts receivable balances of approximately billion at february  we have significant experience in managing our credit programs 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a number of factors including account write off experience  account aging  and year end balances 
we do not expect actual results to vary significantly from our estimate 
we use the retail inventory method 
under this method  we record markdowns to value merchandise inventories at net realizable value 
we closely monitor actual and forecasted sales trends  current inventory levels  and aging information by merchandise categories 
if forecasted sales are not achieved  additional markdowns may be needed in future periods to clear excess or slow moving merchandise  which may result in lower gross margins 
when a store experiences unfavorable operating performance  we evaluate whether an impairment charge should be recorded 
a store s assets are evaluated for impairment by comparing its estimated undiscounted cash flows to its carrying value 
if the cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value  the assets are written down to fair value 
impairment losses associated with these reviews have not been significant 
however  if store for store sales declines and general negative economic trends continue  future impairment losses may be significant 
we self insure a portion of the exposure for costs related to workers compensation and general liability 
expenses are recorded based on actuarial estimates for reported and incurred but not reported claims considering a number of factors  including historical claims experience  severity factors  litigation costs  inflation  and other actuarial assumptions 
although we do not expect the amount we will ultimately pay to differ significantly from our estimates  self insurance reserves could be affected if future claims experience differs significantly from the historical trends and our assumptions 
we use various assumptions and estimates to measure the expense and funded status of our pension plans 
those assumptions and estimates include discount rates  rates of return on plan assets  rates of future compensation increases  employee turnover rates  and anticipated mortality rates 
the use of different assumptions and estimates in our pension plans could result in a significantly different funded status and plan expense 
based on current estimates and assumptions  we believe our pension expense will be approximately million 
impact of new accounting pronouncements in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which eliminates goodwill amortization and prescribes a new approach for assessing potential goodwill impairments 
our transitional assessment of potential goodwill impairments under sfas no 
did not identify any impairment 
goodwill amortization incurred in was million or per share and million or per share in net earnings excluding goodwill amortization was million or per share in and million or per share in in  we adopted sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
eliminates the requirement to classify gains and losses from the extinguishment of indebtedness as extraordinary  requires certain lease modifications to be treated the same as a sale leaseback transaction  and makes other nonsubstantive technical corrections to existing pronouncements 
the impact of adopting sfas no 
was the reclassification of the extraordinary loss of million net of million in taxes to interest expense and income taxes  and the classification of early debt redemption costs of million as interest expense in the current year 
in  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
changes the timing of when certain costs associated with restructuring activities may be recognized 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the combination of our kaufmann s division with our filene s division and our meier frank division with our robinsons may division was initiated in may and recorded in accordance with the rules effective at that time 
the closure of the arizona credit center and the data center realignment were recorded in accordance with sfas no 
in  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how cash consideration received by a customer or reseller should be classified in the customer s statement of earnings 
we do not expect eitf issue no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or operating results 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk primarily arises from changes in interest rates on short term debt 
short term debt has generally been used to finance seasonal working capital needs resulting in minimal exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
long term debt is at fixed interest rates 
our merchandise purchases are denominated in united states dollars 
operating expenses of our international buying offices located outside the united states are generally paid in local currency and are not material 
during fiscal   and  we did not enter into any derivative financial instruments 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements as defined by the private securities litigation reform act of while such statements reflect all available information and management s judgment and estimates of current and anticipated conditions and circumstances and are prepared with the assistance of specialists within and outside the company  there are many factors outside of our control that have an impact on our operations

because of these factors  actual performance could differ materially from that described in the forward looking statements
