overview of business the pc marketplace is characterized by intense price competition and rapid technological changes as leading pc systems manufacturers compete among themselves and other pc clone makers for market share 
it is in this difficult environment that we determined that it was in the best interest of our stockholders to merge our graphics division with another high tech company to improve the graphics division s competitive situation and provide it with additional resources 
on june  we announced that the assets of our graphics division will be acquired by xgi technology  inc xgi  the graphics unit previously spun off from silicon integrated system corp sis 
xgi will be capitalized through cash infusion from outside investors 
this transaction closed on july  and we received a equity interest in xgi 
in a separate transaction  the assets of our digital media division were merged with our subsidiary  trident technologies  inc tti in taiwan  on august  to strengthen and extend the company s digitally processed television business 
as a result of these transactions  we will be able to focus our resources on our restructured dm business as well as focus on other challenges and opportunities in the rapidly growing digital media market 
after the close of this transaction we held a equity interest in tti 
we have been investing in and experiencing success in the digital television market for several years 
during that time  the digital television industry has grown rapidly and we believe that this industry is on the verge of a further  significant growth phase 
we undertook our restructuring to allow us to build upon our prior success in this market by focusing our resources primarily on digital media products 
we are optimistic that this will position trident for a return to profitability 
as a result of the restructuring  we expect to increase the resources devoted to the digital television market  but still reduce our overall expense level 
we expect to experience additional benefits from focusing on digital media products 
these include a broader customer base and  consequently  less dependence on a limited group of customers  as well as a longer product life and longer design cycle for our products 
we believe these and other factors will position trident for success in the market and for a more effective business model than the one we operated in the graphics industry

critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  equity investments  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations  excess component order cancellation costs  restructuring  long term service contracts  pensions and other post retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we recognize product sales as revenue  generally upon shipment  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss pass to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
a reserve for sales returns is established based on historical trends in product returns 
sales to resellers are generally recognized upon shipment to end user customers 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions  historical returns  inventory levels at distributors and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to decline  we may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we currently evaluate our long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 

table of contents factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for the our business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and or a significant decline in the our stock price for a sustained period of time 
we hold minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus  three of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile share prices 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future

provision benefit for income taxes for fiscal we recorded a provision for income taxes of million to increase our valuation allowance and reduce the carrying amount of our net deferred tax asset to zero 
based on our assessment of all available evidence  including consideration of historical and future estimated taxable losses  we concluded that it was more likely than not our net deferred tax asset was would not be realized 
the net deferred tax asset arose during fiscal due to decreases in our deferred tax liabilities associated with cumulative unrealized holding gains on our umc investment
