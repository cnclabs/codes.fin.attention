item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report 
this discussion includes references to cash available for distribution  or cad 
we compute cad as net income available for common shareholders plus depreciation and amortization expense  plus non cash expenses including only amortization of deferred financing costs and administrative expenses to be settled in our common shares  minus those deposits made into ff e escrow accounts which are owned by us but which are restricted to use for improvements at our properties 
our method of calculating cad may not be comparable to cad which may be reported by other reits that define this term differently 
we consider cad to be an appropriate measure of performance for hpt  along with cash flow from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  because it provides investors with an indication of hpt s operating performance and our ability to incur and service debt  make capital expenditures  pay distributions and fund other cash needs 
our cad is an important factor considered by our board of trustees in determining the amount of our distributions to shareholders 
cad does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as a measure of financial performance or liquidity 
current events as a result of the terrorist attacks on the united states on september   concerns regarding a war with iraq or other countries or another terrorist attack  and the impact of a recessionary economy  the us hotel industry has experienced significant declines versus the comparable prior periods in occupancy  revenues and profitability 
these declines primarily arise from reduced business travel and  during  most of our hotel operators reported declines in the operating performance of our hotels versus the prior year 
as of december   all of our rent payments are current 
as described below  our leases and operating agreements contain security features  such as guarantees  which are intended to protect payment of minimum rents and returns to us in accordance with our leases and agreements regardless of hotel performance 
however  the effectiveness of various security features to provide uninterrupted payments to us is not assured  particularly if travel patterns continue at depressed levels for extended periods 
if our tenants  hotel managers or guarantors default in their payment obligations to us  our revenues will decline 
leases and operating agreements each of our hotels is included in one of nine groups of hotels of between and properties 
these groups are each operated under a pooled agreement by a third party as tenant or manager for an initial term expiring between and the agreements contain renewal options for all  but not less than all  of the properties in the same group  and the renewal terms total years 
each agreement requires the lessee or operator to i pay all operating costs associated with the hotels  ii deposit a percentage of total hotel sales into reserves established for the regular refurbishment of our hotels ff e reserves  iii make payments to us of minimum rents or returns  and iv make payments to us of additional returns equal to of increases in total hotel sales over sales during a specified base year 
each third party has posted a security or performance deposit with us generally equal to one year s minimum rent or return 
one of the nine groups discussed above contains hotels 
as of december   of these hotels are operated by subsidiaries of marriott international  inc marriott under long term management contracts and leased to our owned taxable reit subsidiary  or trs  as allowed by the tax laws applicable to reits 
on june   we purchased four hotels managed by marriott and our trs began to lease an additional six hotels which we own 
on september  and september   our trs began to lease six and two hotels  respectively  which we own 
also as of december   the remaining hotels in this group are leased to and operated by subsidiaries of marriott 
marriott s obligation to pay rents and returns to us for all of these hotels is combined for all purposes under these agreements 
an additional four hotels of the leased to marriott began to be leased to our trs in january from time to time prior to june   each of the remaining hotels leased to marriott are expected to begin to be leased to our trs and managed by marriott 
our trs does not operate any hotels 
instead  after our trs begins to lease each hotel  marriott continues to operate the hotel as manager and our trs begins to pay rent and ff e reserves to our other subsidiaries 
because our trs is consolidated with us  our consolidated statement of income does not show rental income or ff e reserve income paid by our trs to our other subsidiaries  instead  our consolidated statement of income shows hotel operating revenues and hotel operating expenses for these hotels 
historically  upon the transfer to us of hotel leasehold interests  the net of hotel operating revenues and hotel operating expenses has generally been equal to the rental income and ff e reserve income previously attributable to that hotel  a condition we expect will continue as transfers occur under current market conditions 
results of operations dollar amounts in thousands  except per share amounts year ended december  versus year ended december  total revenues were  for  a increase over revenues of  for this increase is primarily due to activities of our trs and our hotel acquisitions 
rental income was  for  a increase from  for this increase is a result of our acquisition of hotels in april  partially offset by minimum rental income recognized in for hotels which subsequently began to be leased to our trs 
ff e reserve income represents amounts paid by our tenants into restricted accounts owned by us  the purpose of which is to accumulate funds for future capital expenditures 
the terms of our leases require these amounts to be calculated as a percentage of total sales at our hotels 
the ff e reserve income was  for  a decrease from ff e reserve income of  for this decrease is due primarily to reduced levels of hotel sales attributable to the general slowdown of business travel across the united states described above  offset somewhat by a scheduled increase in the applicable percentage used to calculate ff e reserves at some of our hotels 
part of this decrease is also due to activities related to the hotels which began to be leased by our trs at various times from june  as discussed above 
the revenues which are escrowed as ff e reserves for hotels leased by our trs are not separately stated in our consolidated statements of income 
our trs s activities have given rise to hotel operating revenues of  for  a increase over hotel operating revenues of  in our trs s activities have also given rise to hotel operating expenses of  for  a increase over hotel operating expenses of  in the increases in hotel operating revenues and expenses were caused by activities at the hotels that began to be leased by our trs  at various times  from june the hotels leased to our trs generated net operating results that were  in and  in less than the minimum returns due to us 
these amounts have been reflected in our statement of income as a net reduction to hotel operating expenses in each year because they were funded by marriott 
we expect hotel operating revenues and hotel operating expenses to increase in the future as hotels currently leased by marriott begin to be leased to our trs and operated by marriott from time to time prior to june   including four hotels beginning in january interest income was for  a decrease from interest income of for this decrease was due to a lower average cash balance and a lower average interest rate during total expenses were  for  a increase over total expenses of  for the increase is due primarily to our recognition of hotel operating expenses for a larger number of hotels leased to our trs in than in  and increases in other expenses arising from our additional hotel investments during and interest expense for was  a increase over interest expense of  for the increase was primarily due to higher average borrowings partially offset by a lower weighted average interest rate during depreciation and amortization expense was  for  a increase over depreciation and amortization expense of  for this increase was due principally to the impact of the depreciation of hotels acquired in april  and the impact of the purchase of depreciable assets during and with funds from ff e reserve accounts owned by us

in  we recognized an extraordinary loss of  to write off the unamortized deferred financing costs associated with  of senior notes we redeemed on july  net income available for common shareholders was  for  or per share  a increase  or on a per share basis  over net income available for common shareholders of  or per share  for this increase resulted from the investment and operating activity discussed above

the ff e reserves amounts shown here also include  and  for and respectively  of our hotel operating revenues  which we have escrowed for routine capital improvements for the hotels leased to our trs and operated by marriott under a long term management agreement 
hotel revenues which are escrowed as ff e reserves for our hotels leased by our trs are not separately stated in our consolidated statements of income 
some of our leases provide that ff e reserve escrow accounts are owned by our tenants during the lease terms while we have security and remainder interests in the escrow accounts and in property purchased with funding from those accounts

cad was  for  a increase over cad of  for this increase was due to the impact of our acquisition of hotels during april  offset by increases in interest and general and administrative expenses  and a decrease in interest income 
cad does not represent cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of our financial performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
cash flow from operations was million in  a increase from million in primarily due to the impact of new hotel investments in and cash used in investing activities was million in  a decrease from million in  primarily because fewer hotel acquisitions were completed in cash used in financing activities was million in  a increase over million in  primarily because of lower equity issuances in and increased distributions on common shares 
year ended december  versus year ended december  total revenues were  for  a increase over revenues of  for this increase is primarily due to our trs s activities and our hotel acquisitions

the terms of our leases require these amounts to be calculated as a percentage of total sales at our hotels 
the ff e reserve income was  for  a decrease from ff e reserve income of  for this decrease is due primarily to reduced levels of hotel sales attributable to the events of september   and modest declines which began to affect the hotel industry earlier in as a result of the recessionary economy  offset somewhat by a scheduled increase in the applicable percentage used to calculate ff e reserves at some of our hotels 
part of this decrease is also due to activities related to the hotels which began to be leased by our trs at various times from june  as discussed above  the revenues which are escrowed as ff e reserves for hotels leased by our trs are not separately stated in our consolidated statements of income 
our trs s activities gave rise to hotel operating revenues of  and hotel operating expenses of  in hotel operating expenses were reduced by payments of  from marriott in under the terms of its guarantee to us 
there are no comparable amounts in the period because all of our hotels were operated under third party leases

the ff e reserves amounts shown here also include  and zero for and respectively  of our hotel operating revenues  which we have escrowed for routine capital improvements for the hotels leased to our trs and operated by marriott under a long term management agreement 
hotel revenues which are escrowed as ff e reserves for our hotels leased by our trs are not separately stated in our consolidated statements of income 
some of our leases provide that ff e reserve escrow accounts are owned by our tenants during the lease terms while we have security and remainder interests in the escrow accounts and in property purchased with funding from those accounts 
deposits into ff e reserve accounts owned by our tenants during the and periods totaled  and  respectively  and are not removed here because they are not included in our income 
cad was  for  a increase over cad of  for this increase was due to the impact of our acquisition of eight hotels during  offset by increases in interest and general and administrative expenses  and a decrease in interest income 
cad does not represent cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of our financial performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
cash flow from operations was million in  a increase from million in primarily due to the impact of new hotel investments in and cash used in investing activities was million in  a increase from million in  primarily because of larger investments in hotels purchased in versus hotels in cash used in financing activities was million in a decrease from million in  primarily because of our equity issuance in offset somewhat by increased distributions on common shares  we issued no equity in liquidity and capital resources our tenants and operators all of our hotels are leased to or operated by third parties 
we do not operate hotels 
all costs of operating and maintaining our hotels are paid by these third parties for their own account or as agent for us 
these third parties derive their funding for hotel operating expenses  reserves for renovations  or ff e reserves  and rents and returns due us generally from hotel operating revenues 
we define coverage for each of our nine grouped hotel leases or operating agreement as combined total hotel sales minus all expenses which are not subordinated to minimum payments to us and the required ff e reserve contributions  divided by the aggregate minimum payments to us 
more detail regarding coverage  guarantees and other security features is presented in the table on pages and eight of nine of our hotel pools  representing hotels  generated coverage of at least x during  and three hotel pools  representing hotels generated coverage of at least x during if a hotel pool does not generate coverage of at least x  our tenant or operator must supplement hotel operating results to make the minimum payments due to us to prevent default under the lease or operating agreement 
in addition  hotels we own in five pools  of our total investments  at cost  are operated under leases or management agreements which are subject to full or limited guarantees 
these guarantees may provide us with continued payments if combined total hotel sales less total hotel expenses and required ff e reserve payments fail to equal or exceed amounts due to us 
our tenants and managers or their affiliates may also supplement cash flow from our hotels in order to make payments to us and preserve their rights to continue operating our hotels 
guarantee or supplemental payments to us  if any  made under any of our leases or management agreements  do not subject us to repayment obligations 
as of december   all payments due  including those payments due under leases or operating agreements whose hotels have generated less than x coverage during  are current 
however  the effectiveness of various security features to provide uninterrupted payments to us is not assured  particularly if travel patterns continue at depressed levels for extended periods 
some of our leases and guarantees require our tenants  subtenants and guarantors to maintain minimum net worths  as defined in the documents 
at december   it appears that the barcelo crestline subtenants and candlewood guarantor  as described in charts on pages and  respectively  may have lesser net worths than are required by our sublease and guaranty documents 
we have granted limited waivers of these net worth requirements while we negotiate with these subtenants and the guarantor regarding these matters 
if our tenants  hotel managers or guarantors default in their payment obligations to us  our revenues will decline 
our operating liquidity and resources our principal source of funds for current expenses and distributions to shareholders is our operations  primarily rents from leasing and the excess of hotel operating revenues over hotel operating expenses for hotels leased to our trs 
minimum rents and minimum returns are received from our tenants and managers monthly in advance and percentage rents and returns are received either monthly or quarterly in arrears 
this flow of funds has historically been sufficient for us to pay our operating expenses  including interest  and distributions 
we believe that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses  including interest  and distribution payments for the foreseeable future 
we have maintained our status as a reit under the internal revenue code  by meeting certain requirements  including the distribution of our taxable income to our shareholders 
as a reit  we do not expect to pay federal income taxes on the majority of our income 
in federal legislation known as the reit modernization act  or rma  was enacted and became effective on january  the rma  among other things  allows a reit to lease hotels to a trs if the hotel is managed by an independent third party 
we entered our first transaction using a trs on june  the income realized by our trs in excess of the rent it pays to us will be subject to income tax at customary corporate rates 
as and if the financial performance of the hotels operated for the account of our trs improves  these taxes may become material  but the anticipated taxes are not material to our consolidated financial results at this time 
our investment and financing liquidity and resources dollar amounts in thousands  except per share amounts various percentages of total sales at all of our hotels are escrowed as reserves for future renovations and refurbishment  or ff e reserves  as discussed above 
as of december   there was approximately  on deposit in these escrow accounts  of which  was held directly by us and reflected on our balance sheet as restricted cash 
the remaining  is held in accounts owned by our tenants and is not reflected on our balance sheet 
we have security and remainder interests in the accounts owned by our tenants 
during   was contributed to these accounts and  was spent from these accounts to renovate and refurbish our hotels 
in order to fund acquisitions and to accommodate occasional cash needs that may result from timing differences between the receipt of rents and the need to make distributions or pay operating expenses  we maintain a revolving credit facility with a group of commercial banks 
the credit facility in effect at the beginning of expired in march our new facility matures in june and may be extended at our option to june upon our payment of an extension fee 
the new facility permits borrowing up to  and includes a feature under which the maximum draw may expand to  in certain circumstances 
drawings under our credit facility are unsecured 
funds may be drawn  repaid and redrawn until maturity  and no principal repayment is due until maturity 
interest on borrowings under the credit facility is payable at a spread above libor 
at december   we had  of cash and cash equivalents and all  available on our revolving credit facility 
we expect to use existing cash balances  borrowings under our credit facility or other lines of credit and net proceeds of offerings of equity or debt securities to fund future property acquisitions 
at december   we had no commitments to purchase additional properties 
however  we expect to make improvements and undertake a modernization program at of our courtyard by marriott r hotels 
these hotels contain  rooms  representing of the total courtyard by marriott r rooms which we own 
approximately  of the estimated  cost for this project is expected to be funded by amounts on deposit in ff e reserve accounts 
we plan to fund the remaining  of costs with existing cash balances or borrowings under our credit facility 
upon funding  our minimum annual rent related to these hotels will increase by of the amount funded 
our funding is expected to take place before the end of the second quarter 
in january  we issued  of senior notes  due net proceeds after underwriting and other offering expenses were  in february  we redeemed at par plus accrued interest  all  of our outstanding senior notes due our debts have maturities  as adjusted for january and february transactions  as follows  in   in   in and  in none of these debt obligations require principal or sinking fund payments prior to their maturity date 
to the extent amounts are outstanding on our credit facility and  as the maturity dates of our credit facility and term debt approach over the longer term  we will explore alternatives for the repayment of amounts due 
such alternatives in the short term and long term may include incurring additional long term debt and issuing new equity securities 
in march  our shelf registration statement was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission 
as of december   we had  available on our shelf registration 
an effective shelf registration allows us to issue public securities on an expedited basis  but it does not assure that there will be buyers for securities offered by us 
although there can be no assurance that we will consummate any debt or equity security offerings or other financings  we believe we will have access to various types of financing  including investment grade debt or equity securities offerings  with which to finance future acquisitions and to pay our debt and other obligations 
on january   a distribution of per common share was declared with respect to fourth quarter results and was paid to shareholders on february   using cash on hand 
debt covenants our debt obligations at december   were limited to our revolving credit facility and our million of public debt 
each issue of our public debt is governed by an indenture 
this indenture and its supplements and our credit facility agreement contain a number of financial ratio covenants which generally restrict our ability to incur debts  including debts secured by mortgages on our properties  in excess of calculated amounts  require us to maintain a minimum net worth  as defined  restrict our ability to make distributions under certain circumstances and require us to maintain other ratios  as defined 
during the period from our incurrence of these debts through december   we were in compliance with all of our covenants under our indenture and its supplements and our credit agreement 
neither our indenture and its supplements nor our bank credit facility contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings 
however  under our credit agreement  our senior debt rating is used to determine the fees and interest rate applied to borrowings 
our public debt indenture and its supplements contain cross default provisions to any other debts of million or more 
similarly  a default on our public indenture would constitute a default on our credit agreement 
as of december   we had no commercial paper  derivatives  swaps  hedges  guarantees  joint ventures or partnerships 
as of december   we had no secured debt obligations 
none of our debt documentation requires us to provide collateral security in the event of a ratings downgrade 
we have no off balance sheet liabilities 
related party transactions we have an agreement with reit management research llc  or rmr 
rmr provides investment  management and administrative services to us 
rmr is owned by barry m 
portnoy and gerard m 
martin  each a managing trustee and member of our board of trustees 
each of our executive officers are also officers of rmr 
our independent trustees  including all of our trustees other than messrs 
portnoy and martin  review our contract with rmr at least annually and make determinations regarding its negotiation  renewal or termination 
any termination of our contract with rmr would cause a default under our bank credit facility  if not approved by a majority of lenders 
our current contract term with rmr expires on december  rmr is compensated at an annual rate equal to of our average real estate investments  as defined  up to the first million of such investments and thereafter plus an incentive fee based upon increases in cash available for distribution per share  as defined 
the incentive fee payable to rmr is paid in our common shares 
critical accounting policies our most critical accounting policies involve our investments in real property 
these policies affect our allocation of purchase price between various asset categories and the related impact on our recognition of depreciation expense  assessment of the carrying value of long lived assets  and classification of our leases 
these policies involve significant judgments based upon our experience  including judgments about current valuations  ultimate realizable value  estimated useful lives  salvage or residual value  the ability of our tenants and operators to perform their obligations to us  and the current and likely future operating and competitive environment in which our properties are located 
in the future we may need to revise our assessments to incorporate information which is not now known and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties we own  which could result in the classification of new leases as other than operating leases or could decrease the net carrying value of our assets 
property leases  operating agreements and tenant operating statistics as of december   we owned hotels which are grouped into nine combinations and leased to or managed by separate affiliates of hotel operating companies including marriott international  inc  host marriott corporation  barcelo crestline corporation  wyndham international  inc  prime hospitality corporation  candlewood hotel company  inc and bre homestead village llc 
the tables on the following pages summarize the key terms of our leases and operating agreements at december   and include statistics reported directly to us or derived from statistics reported to us by our tenants and operators 
these statistics include occupancy  average daily rate  or adr  revenue per available room  or revpar  and coverage 
although we consider these statistics  along with the lease or operating agreement security features also presented in the tables on the following pages  to be important measures of our tenants and operators success in operating our hotels and their ability to make continued payments to us  none of the third party reported information is a direct measure of our financial performance

seasonality our hotels have historically experienced seasonal differences typical of the us hotel industry with higher revenues in the second and third quarters of calendar years compared with the first and fourth quarters 
this seasonality is not expected to cause material fluctuations in our income because our contractual lease and operating agreement require our tenants managers to make the substantial portion of our rents and return payments to us in equal amounts throughout a year 
seasonality may affect our hotel operating revenues  but we do not expect seasonal variations to have a material impact upon our financial results of operations or upon our tenants or operators ability to meet their contractual obligations to us 
inflation we believe that inflation should not have a material adverse effect on us 
although increases in the rate of inflation may tend to increase interest rates which we may pay for borrowed funds  our floating rate borrowings are not expected to be outstanding for extended periods  and if we believe they will be outstanding for extended periods we may purchase interest rate caps to protect us from interest rate increases 
in addition  our leases provide for the payment of percentage rent to us based on increases in total sales  and such rent may increase with inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring our available financing alternatives 
our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates is unchanged from december  other than as described below we do not foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the near future 
in january we issued million of senior notes due and in february we prepaid million of senior notes due including the impact of these two transactions  at march   our total outstanding debt consisted of four issues of fixed rate  senior unsecured notes annual annual principal balance interest rate interest expense maturity interest payments due million million semi annually million million semi annually million million semi annually million million semi annually million million no principal repayments are due under these notes until maturity 
because these notes bear interest at fixed rates  changes in market interest rates during the term of this debt will not effect our operating results 
if at maturity these notes were refinanced at interest rates which are higher than shown above  our per annum interest cost would increase by approximately million 
changes in the interest rate also affect the fair value of our debt obligations  increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations in the table above by approximately million 
each of our fixed rate debt arrangements allows us to make repayments earlier than the stated maturity date 
we are generally allowed to make prepayments only at face value plus a premium equal to a make whole amount  as defined  generally designed to preserve a stated yield to the note holder 
these prepayment rights may afford us the opportunity to mitigate the risk of refinancing at maturity at higher rates by refinancing prior to maturity 
our revolving credit facility bears interest at floating rates and matures in as of december   there was zero outstanding and the full amount of million was available 
the credit facility has a feature that will allow us to expand borrowings up to million  in certain cases 
our revolving credit facility is available to finance acquisitions and for general business purposes 
repayments under the revolving credit facility may be made at any time without penalty 
our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates may in the future increase if we incur debt to fund future acquisitions or otherwise
