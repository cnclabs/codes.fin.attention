critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the application of certain of these policies requires significant judgments or an historical based estimation process that can affect the results of operations and financial position of the company as well as the related footnote disclosures 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable 
if actual amounts ultimately differ from previous estimates  the revisions are included in the company s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
critical accounting policies generally consist of those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumption conditions 
the accounting policies and estimates that can have a significant impact upon the operating results  financial position and footnote disclosures of the company are as follows revenue recognition revenue from the sale of goods is recognized at the time of shipment 
obligations for sales returns and allowances and product warranties are recognized at the time of sale on an accrual basis as described below 
sales returns reserve the reserve reflects the gross profit impact of expected returns and related stock adjustments  as well as reducing accounts receivable and increasing inventory for the amount of expected returns 
the amount of the reserve is determined by multiplying the sales and cost of sales by product category for the current quarter by historical return rates adjusted for any known changes in key variables affecting return rates 
thus  judgments must be made regarding anticipated return rates 
this reserve will vary based on the changes in sales  gross margin and historical  as well as anticipated  return rates from quarter to quarter 
warranty reserve the company provides a two year warranty for its products and also allows customers to return defective product that has been returned by the consumer 
consequently  it maintains a warranty reserve  which reflects historical warranty returns rates by product category multiplied by the most recent six months of unit sales of that model and the unit standard cost of the model 
the company uses the most recent six months of unit sales in the estimate  as historical experience tells the company that most warranty returns will occur within six months of their original sale date 
therefore  judgments must be made based on historical warranty returns rates and how the returned product will be disposed  either by liquidation or return to vendors 
this reserve may vary based upon the level of sales and changes in historical return rates from quarter to quarter as well as estimated costs of disposal 
liquidation reserve the company maintains a reserve representing the write down of returned inventory to net realizable value 
returned inventory is either sold to various liquidators or returned to vendors for credit against similar  new models depending upon the level of demand for the models 
judgments are made as to whether various models are to be liquidated or returned to vendor and  for the former  the liquidation prices expected to be received 
this reserve can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending upon quantities of returned inventory on hand and the estimated liquidation price per unit 
advertising and sales promotion accrual the reserve reflects amounts provided to retailers and distributors for advertising and sales promotions 
customer programs  agreed to at the beginning of each year  are mainly variable programs dependent on sales  and may be revised during the course of the year  based upon a customer s projected sales and other factors  such as  new promotional opportunities 
accruals are made monthly for each customer  by multiplying an estimated program accrual percentage by the customer s actual sales 
therefore  this accrual will vary depending on a given quarter s sales and the sales mix of customers from quarter to quarter 
in addition  should a customer significantly exceed or fall short of their planned program sales  adjustments may need to be made to the customer s estimated program accrual percentage due to certain minimum and or maximum sales thresholds in the customer s programs 
deferred compensation obligations under the deferred compensation plans and annual deferred compensation expense are determined by a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in determination of obligations under the plans and annual deferred compensation expenses include the discount rate and anticipated compensation for each individual covered by the plans  which in part is dependent upon the anticipated future profitability of the company 
the discount rate used approximates the fixed rate of return the company earns on the cash surrender value of an insurance policy purchased to fund payments to the retired president and ceo  which represented approximately half of the total obligation of the plans at december  this discount rate was for both and the compensation increase assumptions are based on historical experience and anticipated future actions and performance 
net realizable value reserve the company maintains a reserve to write down certain non defective inventory below cost  as necessary 
the reserve includes models where it is determined that net realizable value is less than cost 
thus  judgments must be made about which models are to be included and the estimated net realizable value 
this reserve will vary depending upon the specific models selected  the estimated net realizable value for each model and quantities of each model that are determined to be necessary from quarter to quarter

in most cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the us  with no need for management s judgment in their application
