overview the company has been engaged in the construction  development  management and operation of cellular telephone systems in the southeastern united states 
effective august   the company contributed substantially all of the assets and liabilities of its operating subsidiary  price communications wireless  inc pcw  to the verizon partnership 
accordingly  the financial information for the year ended december  is not comparable to the year ended december  the company remains listed on the new york and other stock exchanges  has no operating assets and approximately billion in an illiquid preferred partnership interest in the verizon partnership  cash and marketable securities 
contribution of the company s wireless business to the verizon partnership on december   the company agreed to contribute substantially all of the assets of pcw and approximately million in cash to the verizon partnership in exchange for a preferred limited partnership interest in the verizon partnership 
the transaction was consummated on august  the verizon partnership assumed certain liabilities of pcw relating to the contributed business including the liabilities under pcw s senior subordinated notes due and senior secured notes due 
after giving effect to certain adjustments  as defined in the transaction agreement  pcw s initial capital account approximated billion 
according to the partnership agreement  the company is entitled to an allocation of any profits from the verizon partnership for a period of up to four years after august  equal to its preferred return  which currently approximates per annum 
the company will receive in cash of its preferred return  with the balance being added to its capital account under a letter agreement dated august   verizon communications provided the verizon partnership with million of debt financing which was used in connection with the covenant defeasance and redemption of pcw s senior subordinated notes and senior secured notes 
pcw guaranteed such indebtedness 
however  pcw is not obligated to make payment under the guaranty until verizon communications has exhausted all remedies against the verizon partnership 
the company believes that the probability of the guaranty being enforced is remote 
price has guaranteed pcw s obligation under the guaranty  and has deposited million in cash and other property into a collateral account to secure the guaranty 
price controls the investment of the assets in the collateral account  has the right to withdraw certain sums such as dividends and interest on investments from the account  and has the right  in addition  to withdraw up to million from the account to cover its ordinary operating expenses 
price and verizon communications have further agreed that price retain its cash existing at the closing of the asset contribution which is not reserved to satisfy known liabilities existing at such time and in any event in a minimum amount of million for the purpose of making such investments as price deems appropriate 
if a qualifying initial public offering of verizon wireless inc common stock as defined in the transaction agreement occurs before august  the company will have an option to subject to approval of price s shareholders exchange its preferred exchangeable interest for shares of verizon wireless common stock 
if this happens  the number of shares the company would receive would be calculated by dividing the existing balance in the company s capital account in the verizon partnership by the verizon wireless initial public offering price 
if the company chooses not to exercise such option including as a result of the failure of the company s shareholders to approve such exchange  it will be obligated to exchange its preferred exchangeable interest for verizon communications common stock on august  or such earlier date as may be specified by verizon communications 
in this latter case  the number of shares the company will receive will be determined by dividing the amount in the company s capital account as of the date of exchange by the greater of the trailing day average closing price of verizon communications common stock as of the exchange date or 
in the event a qualifying initial public offering of verizon wireless does not occur prior to august   or if verizon wireless does complete such an offering but an exchange into verizon wireless common stock does not occur solely as a result of a breach of agreement by verizon wireless  the preferred exchangeable interest will be mandatorily exchanged for shares of verizon communications common stock on approximately august  in these circumstances  the number of shares of verizon communications common stock issuable to the company will equal the balance in the company s capital account in the verizon partnership on august  divided by the trailing day average closing price of verizon communications common stock  but such price may not be less than or more than at december  the closing market price of verizon communications common stock was 
although this is below the floor price of per share established in the agreement  the company believes this is a temporary decrease in the value of its investment in the verizon partnership 
subsequent to december   the market price for verizon communications has fluctuated above and below in addition  in certain circumstances including a change in control of the company or a transfer of the preferred exchangeable interest to a secured creditor of the company  verizon communications will have the right to cause an exchange of the preferred exchangeable interest into verizon communications common stock  whether or not an initial public offering of verizon wireless common stock has occurred 
pursuant to the partnership agreement for the verizon partnership  pcw is entitled to receive taxable allocations of any profits from the verizon partnership in an amount up to its preferred return  which is currently at per annum 
any losses incurred by the verizon partnership will be allocated to cellco partnership and its affiliates up to an amount equal to their capital account before being allocated to pcw 
the company has accounted for the preferred exchangeable interest using the equity method of accounting 
the initial investment on the company s balance sheet will equal the credit in the company s capital account on the verizon partnership s financial statement 
thereafter  the company will increase its investment by the amount of income it will be entitled to based on the availability of profits and the agreed upon preferred rate of return and reduce such investment balance by any cash distributed by the verizon partnership to the company 
under pcc s proxy statement for its annual meeting of shareholders  pcc is conducting a non binding  advisory vote of its shareholders permitting shareholders to express their views as to whether the company should begin now to follow a liquidation strategy with a view toward the liquidation of the company in the years ahead  or as an alternative to a liquidation strategy  the company s management should currently begin to seek to acquire another business that meets the economic and fiduciary requirements of the board of directors 
since this is only a non binding advisory vote for the purpose of providing guidance to the board of directors and management  the outcome of this advisory vote will be only one factor considered by the board of directors and management in determining their views regarding the proper future course to be followed by the company 
regardless of the outcome of the vote  the board of directors and management have the right  consistent with their fiduciary duties and exercise of their business judgment  to recommend to the shareholders that the company be liquidated subject to the requisite vote of at least of the company s outstanding shares at a future meeting of shareholders  to seek other potential business opportunities  or to follow another course of action with respect to the company s future 
under new york state law  the affirmative vote of the holders of at least of pcc s outstanding shares will be required at a future shareholders meeting to approve a liquidation of the company 
in recent votes of pcc s shareholders between and of pcc s shareholders have failed to vote with any such failure to vote at such a future meeting of pcc s shareholders making it more difficult to reach the affirmative vote required to approve liquidation 
the holders of approximately of pcc s outstanding common shares including robert price  the company s chief executive officer  members of his family  other officers and directors of the company  and other shareholders who have volunteered their opinions have indicated to pcc that they currently oppose a liquidation strategy and may continue to do so in the future 
the board of directors consequently believes that it may be difficult at any future shareholders meeting to obtain the necessary votes to approve liquidation 
the company and mr 
price in his capacity as chief executive officer of the company and in his personal capacity have been shown a variety of potential acquisitions and opportunities 
these include the purchase of a mutual fund management company  banks  cellular properties  independent telephone companies  broadcasting and or publishing companies and the conversion of the company into a closed end investment company 
the company s board of directors has unanimously recommended that the shareholders vote for beginning to seek a new business in the non binding  advisory vote 
in reaching this conclusion  the board considered the following material factors on january   verizon wireless announced the withdrawal of its registration statement for an initial public offering of its common stock  given its strong cash flow and lack of significant funding requirements  if the company determines to follow a liquidation strategy  its activities prior to liquidation will be limited to the ownership of the preferred exchangeable interest  with the result that the company will not be able to take advantage of other opportunities to maximize shareholder value during what may be a prolonged period of time before liquidation even becomes possible  if the company determines to seek another business to add to the company  the board of directors will have the ability to attempt to maximize shareholder value through the acquisition of a business that meets the board s economic and fiduciary requirements  there can be no assurance that the company will identify or succeed in acquiring a business that meets its economic and fiduciary requirements or that such an acquisition  if consummated  will be profitable  if the company is not liquidated within one year following an exchange for shares of verizon stock  and the company decides to sell such shares or distribute them to the shareholders  the company and or its shareholders may incur substantial tax liability on any such sales or distributions  and if the company determines to seek another business but such business is not acquired by the company  the board will still have the flexibility to recommend liquidation to the shareholders  if the board determines that liquidation is in the best interests of the company 
results of operations as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  during the company determined that the accounting for a non cash item related to the conversion of preferred stock by the company s chief executive officer and the related accrual of deferred tax benefits in prior years was not correct 
consequently  the company has restated its previously reported results for the years to to remove the effects of the prior accounting for these items  which in to included the amortization of deferred compensation and recording a related deferred tax benefit  and instead recorded compensation expense of  and  in and  respectively 
additionally  the company eliminated amortization of deferred compensation expense of  in and  in each of and and eliminated deferred tax benefits of in and  in each of and in the third quarter of  the company had written off the remaining balance of the deferred compensation of  and had reversed the previously recorded deferred tax benefits of  in conjunction with the sale of its cellular business 
in the audited financial statements for the year ended december   these write offs are now eliminated because the deferred compensation charges are now recognized in prior years and the deferred tax benefit should not have been recorded 
therefore  the net impact on retained earnings of these changes is zero as of december  although the expense is recognized in different years 
in addition  because the company s prior independent auditors have ceased operations  they are unable to issue reports on the company s restated financial statements for years ended prior to december  consequently the consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and have been labeled as restated and unaudited 
the company has determined that a re audit of the prior years financial statements is not practicable and consequently has submitted the prior years financial statements as unaudited 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  as previously stated  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the company s operating subsidiary were contributed to the verizon partnership on august  accordingly  the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  includes seven and one half months of operating activity which therefore precludes any comparison of the current year s operations with the twelve months of operations included in the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations during the first quarter of  the company adopted financial accounting standard no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
management believes the company s cellular licenses qualified as indefinite life intangibles  which were not subject to amortization as of january  accordingly  the current twelve month period does not include any amortization for cellular licenses  which amounted to million for the year ended december   and is included in depreciation and amortization 
in addition  had financial accounting standards no 
been adopted on january   net income would have been million and basic as well as fully diluted earnings per share would have been 
net interest expense  other income  income taxes and net income 
net interest expense decreased by million to million for the current year from million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily a result of the decrease in interest expense on the company s long term debt as a result of the assumption by the verizon partnership of the company s long term debt million on august  effective august   the company contributed the assets of its operating subsidiary pcw and recorded a gain on the transaction 
pcw contributed million of cash  its cellular licenses million net of accumulated amortization and fixed assets million net of accumulated depreciation to the new partnership 
the new partnership assumed pcw s outstanding long term debt million and credited pcw s capital account for billion 
the gain on the transaction was million 
other income expense for the current year amounted to an expense of  compared with income of million for the year ended december  or a net unfavorable change of million 
during the year ended december   the company realized a gain on the disposal of its minority interest in other cellular properties approximating million 
during the current twelve month period  the company wrote off sundry investments approximating million 
in addition  the current year includes  of net investment gains for securities including put and call options  some of which are from the company s own stock 
included in the  are certain losses not deductible for income tax purposes 
the twelve months ended december  result in gains on security and put and call transactions approximating million some of which are from the company s own stock 
included in the million are gains some of which are not taxable for income tax purposes 
as previously stated  the contribution transaction is a non taxable exchange except that for financial statement purposes there is a provision for deferred taxes of million 
the million deferred tax liability on the company s balance sheet as of december  is a result of the estimated potential liability for the difference between the tax basis of the assets contributed by the company and the total consideration received by the company including the forgiveness of long term debt 
the deferred provision included in the total tax provision in the statement of operations for the current year is the difference between deferred taxes on the books of the company prior to the contribution and the million 
the total provision of million for the current twelve month period is compared with a tax provision of million for the year ended december  net income of million for the year ended december  compared with net income of million for the year ended december   is a function of the items discussed above including the operating results of the company s wireless subsidiary for twelve months in but only seven and one half months in year ended december  compared to year ended december  although the company experienced subscriber growth during the year ended december   increasing their total subscribers by to  and the related increase in penetration from to  the decrease in outcollect roaming revenue and its related toll  more than offset the increase in local revenue resulting in decreased operating income 
excluding outcollect air and toll revenue  the average revenue per post paid subscriber increased from for the year ended december  to for the current year 
the company was also negatively affected by an increase in the provision for bad debts million  which combined with decreased outcollect revenue accounts primarily for the company s decreased operating income 
revenue 
service revenues totaled approximately million for the current year compared to approximately million for or a decrease of 
the million decrease is principally a result of the reduction in outcollect air and toll revenue million 
partially offsetting this decrease  is an increase in access revenue million principally due to an increase in the average revenue per rate plan combined with added post paid subscribers for the current twelve month period 
although the company was able to realize an increase in its average access revenue per plan  there was a corresponding increase in the number of free minutes included with these plans which resulted in a decrease of million in post paid airtime revenue 
as the company moved toward the increased usage of multi state and national plans  there was a corresponding decrease in the amount of incollect revenue million and long distance revenue billed to its subscribers 
the number of prepaid subscribers increased during the current year  which increased prepaid revenue by million 
other local revenue items resulted in an increase of  for the current twelve month period 
the reduction in outcollect air and toll revenue is a combination of reduced average reimbursement rates 
for the year ended december  compared to 
for the current year and minutes of use million minutes for the current year compared with million minutes for last year 
the decreasing reimbursement rates are a result of increased competition for roaming traffic  which led to reduced negotiated contractual rates with other cellular carriers 
this trend may continue as a result of new roaming rates negotiated with some of the company s roaming partners as well as the increased number of wireless carriers in each market  which can be utilized by other carriers subscribers 
equipment and installation revenue was million for the current year compared to million in an increase in the number of handsets sold or upgraded  additional units for the current year resulted in an increase of  for phone revenue 
for the current year  excluding upgrades  the company sold  handsets of which  were digital and  were analog 
for the prior year   handsets were sold of which  were digital and  were analog 
a reduction of  of accessory sales and installation revenue more than offset the increase in handset revenue 
historically prepaid customers buy fewer accessories than traditional post paid customers who contributed to the decrease in accessory revenue 
expenses 
expenses increased million from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  expenses increased from of total revenue in to of total revenue in after excluding depreciation and amortization  expenses amount to of total revenue for compared to of total revenue for total operating costs per subscriber excluding pcc overhead amounted to in compared with in net of incollect revenue for both years 
engineering  technical and other direct expenses decreased from million in to million in there are three major components in this category 
the cost of incollect roaming  which represents the amount paid to other cellular carriers for the company s subscribers roaming in other carriers markets  variable network costs such as inter trunk  long distance and directory assistance costs  and engineering costs which consist principally of salaries and related fringe benefits  fixed span line costs and tower rentals 
as a result of negotiations with other cellular carriers see comments above concerning outcollect revenue  the company was able to reduce the amount it reimburses those carriers for incollect roaming resulting in a reduction of incollect cost from million in to million in in addition  there were reductions in long distance and directory assistance costs resulting from renegotiated rates 
during the third quarter of  the company was forced to switch the vendor that dealt with the prepaid system as the previous vendor went out of business 
as a result of the change  the additional cost to run the prepaid system included in direct expenses amounted to million for the current year 
other direct costs  principally long distance  increased by million for the current year due to an increase in usage 
engineering costs in total increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the current year or an increase of million 
during the current year  the company added additional cell sites 
the additional cell sites cause additions in cell site rent and utilities for the current year million 
the additional sites also result in increases in fixed span line and inter trunk costs 
the total cost of equipment increased from million in to million for the current year 
without the cost of accessories actual handset costs decreased by million despite the additional units sold or upgraded and the increasing demand for digital rather than analog handsets 
the average handset cost decreased from in to for the current year 
as a percentage of recovered cost  the company recovered of the cost of equipment in compared to a recovery of in principally as a result of diminished accessory sales that have a positive margin and a decrease in installation revenue 
selling  general and administrative sg a increased from million for to for the current year 
as a percentage of total revenue  sg a increased from of total revenue in to in sales and marketing costs included in sg a are comprised of installation costs  salaries  commissions and advertising 
the sum of these components amounted to million for the year and million for increases in commissions and advertising accounted for the increase 
the cost to add a gross subscriber  which consists of the net loss on equipment sales and sales and marketing expenditures  decreased from in to in customer service costs also included in sg a  primarily billing costs and payroll and related benefits  increased to million in from million in an increase of million for the generation of subscriber s monthly statements  which include printing and mailing costs  are a direct function of the increases in the number of subscribers 
additional subscribers require an increase in the number of cellular bills mailed out  as well as an increase in the number of customer service representatives necessary to handle the subscriber inquiries 
in addition  temporary costs related to the mandated area code changes in the markets contributed to the increase in costs 
offsetting these increases was a million credit issued to the company by its billing vendor due to the problems encountered during the billing conversion see bad debts included in general and administrative expenses described below 
general and administrative expenses the final component of sg a increased to million in from million in the increase for the current year of million is principally a result of the increase in the current year of the provision for bad debts  which increased from million in to million in during the fourth quarter of  the company changed its billing vendor when it learned that the previous billing vendor would not be a long term participant in the cellular billing business 
the transition encountered problems and as a result  the company s collection efforts were hampered  which led to a longer average aging period of the company s accounts receivable and a necessity to provide a higher provision for bad debts 
in the fourth quarter of the current year  the company has consolidated the collection process in one location in order to perform the collection process more efficiently 
general and administrative expenses  excluding customer service costs  increased from of revenue for the previous year to for the current year 
depreciation and amortization increased from million in to million in the increase is a combination of additional depreciation expense due to the increase in capital equipment additions during and and additional amortization for other intangible assets 
interest expense  other income  income taxes  and net income 
net interest expense increased to in from million in principally as a result of an adjustment in for interest earned in a prior period 
other income for includes million resulting from the net gain on the sale of the company s minority equity investment in other cellular properties 
the remaining million is principally attributed to net gains on security transactions of pcc 
other income for resulted largely from gains from security transactions of pcc 
the income tax provision for of million compared to the provision of million in is principally a result of the decrease in financial statement taxable income in at an effective rate of approximately adjusted for certain non taxable security transactions in both years 
the net income of million for compared to net income of million for is a function of the items discussed above 
during the prior year  the company adopted securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab which requires the deferral of certain revenue over the approximate length of a subscribers contract or over the remaining unused minutes for prepaid revenue 
the effect on the prior year s financial statements was not material 
liquidity and capital resources as a result of the asset contribution transaction with verizon  the company has substantial assets but due to their illiquid nature  limited future sources of revenue 
from the asset contribution transaction august  to the exchange of the preferred exchangeable interest for either the common stock of verizon wireless inc or verizon communications inc  the preferred exchangeable interest  and the investments in the collateral account described under contribution of the company s wireless business to the verizon partnership above are expected to be substantially all of the company s assets 
after the asset contribution for a period of up to four years  pcw s share of partnership profits if available will be determined by multiplying a rate of return currently approximately per annum by the balance in its capital account 
of such amount taxable whether or not distributed  pcw is entitled to receive of such earnings in cash  with the balance being added to its capital account in the verizon partnership 
the company did receive the appropriate distribution of million in november and expects to receive such distributions in the future 
during the period following the asset contribution  the company retained sufficient cash to meet its requirement under the collateral agreement and as of december  had unencumbered cash equal to approximately million to meets its current needs 
besides the anticipated quarterly cash distributions from the verizon partnership  the company will have potential additional sources of cash from interest and dividends on investments in the collateral account and its other cash 
as part of the collateral agreement  the company is authorized to withdraw an aggregate of million  in addition to interest  from the collateral account to cover its ordinary operating expenses 
the company has provided a reserve for an additional million for its previous minority interests  which amount is currently being disputed by such parties 
the company currently anticipates that its cash and income will be sufficient to meet any cash obligations in the future 
there is a remote risk  however  if significant unexpected cash needs arise such as a demand for payment under the company s guaranty to verizon communications  that its funds including distributions  interest and dividends will be insufficient to meet its obligations and if the company needs to borrow money to meet such obligations  it may be forced to do so on unfavorable terms 
significant accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our accounting estimates on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following is a summary of our critical significant accounting policies and estimates financial instruments 
at december  and december   substantially all of the company s investment securities were marketable equity securities classified as available for sale securities 
realized gains and losses are accounted for principally by specific identification 
unrealized holding gains and losses for available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported  net of taxes  as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the company sells put and call options some in the company s own stock 
these puts entitle the holders to sell publicly traded securities to the company during certain periods at certain prices 
the company is required to maintain collateral to support options issued 
therefore  such unsettled contracts have been classified as liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets if unsettled at the balance sheet date  with changes in fair values recorded as part of other income expense 
revenue recognition 
service revenue from cellular operations for prepaid and post paid customers included local subscriber revenue and outcollect roaming revenue 
in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which was adopted in the fourth quarter of effective january   prepaid airtime revenue was recognized when the airtime was utilized and activation revenue was recognized over the estimated life of the subscriber s contract or the expected term of the customer s relationship  whichever was longer 
local subscriber revenue was earned by providing access to the cellular network access revenue or  as applicable  for usage of the cellular network airtime revenue 
access revenue was billed one month in advance and was recognized when earned 
postpaid airtime revenue was recognized when the service was rendered 
outcollect roaming revenue represented revenue earned for usage of its cellular network by subscribers of other cellular carriers 
outcollect roaming revenue was recognized when the services were rendered 
equipment sales and installation revenues were recognized upon delivery to the customer or installation of the equipment 
for financial reporting purposes  the company reported of revenues and expenses for the markets for which it provided cellular telephone service 
however  in several of its markets  the company held less than of the equity ownership prior to december  the minority stockholders and partners share of net income in those markets is reflected in the consolidated financial statements as minority interest 
cost to add a subscriber 
the cost to add a subscriber  which consisted principally of the net loss on the sale of equipment  as well as commissions  was recognized at the time the subscriber started to receive cellular service 
both commissions and the loss on the sale of handsets  which represent a separate earnings process  were expensed in the same month that the subscriber commenced using the company s system 
acquisitions and licenses 
the cost of previously acquired companies was allocated first to the identifiable assets  including licenses  based on the fair market value of such assets at the date of acquisition 
accordingly  the company did not record any goodwill 
licenses were amortized on a straight line basis over a year period 
such amortization was in effect prior to the company s adoption of the statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
which the company adopted on january  due to the fact that licenses were deemed by the company to have an indefinite life 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 the company continually evaluated whether subsequent events and circumstances occurred that indicated the remaining estimated useful life of such licenses might warrant revision or that the remaining balance of the license rights may not be recoverable 
the company utilized projected undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the licenses 
subsequent to the application of sfas no 
 the realizability of licenses was evaluated annually 
the company determined fair value by reference to sales of comparable businesses to evaluate the recorded value of licenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company generally utilized fixed debt to fund its acquisitions 
management believes that the use of fixed rate debt minimized the company s exposure to market conditions and the ensuing increases and decreases that could arise with variable rate financing 
as of december   the company no longer has any outstanding debt 
the company is exposed to market risk as it relates to its investment securities  whose values fluctuate with the market and whose values have been adjusted to reflect the market values as of december  in addition  the realizability of the company s investment in the verizon partnership could be effected if the price of verizon communication s common stocks is below for an extended period of time 
the company believes its investment in the verizon partnership is realizable at its recorded value at december
