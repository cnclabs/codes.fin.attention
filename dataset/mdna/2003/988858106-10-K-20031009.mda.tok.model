the continued development of the core bridal business which included the expansion of the zales diamond collection to include an anniversary band and a three stone ring  the launch of the gordon s diamond solitaire and three stone ring and the introduction of the peoples diamond in canada  contributed to the total revenue increase 
in addition to the introduction of these proprietary stones  the company continued to fine tune its merchandise assortments throughout fiscal year despite the volatility of the external environment  three of the brands  zales jewelers  peoples jewellers  and bailey  banks and biddle all had a positive performance that offset the negative performance of the other brands  primarily the kiosk business 
the kiosk business showed improvements in the fourth quarter primarily due to the expansion of lower price point merchandise  such as charms and body jewelry 

table of contents cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was for the fiscal year  an increase of percentage points over last fiscal year

in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  the company tests goodwill for impairment annually  at the end of its second quarter  or more frequently if events occur which indicate a potential reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit s net assets below its carrying value 
an impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  the company performed its annual review for impairment of goodwill related to its piercing pagoda  people s jewellers and other smaller acquisitions 
the company has concluded that there is no evidence of impairment related to the goodwill of approximately million recorded for the people s acquisition and million for other smaller acquisitions 
to perform the impairment test for piercing pagoda  the company engaged an independent third party valuation firm 
this firm calculated the estimated fair value of piercing pagoda using the expected present value of corresponding future cash flows and fair market values of comparable businesses where available 
the calculation indicated that the fair value of piercing pagoda was lower than its carrying value  reflective of the current market conditions and lower than expected performance 
the company recorded a non cash charge of million in the second quarter of fiscal year  which is included as a component of operating earnings in the consolidated statement of operations  to reduce the carrying value of the piercing pagoda goodwill to approximately million 
interest expense  net

income taxes 
the income tax provision for the fiscal years ended july  and was million and million  respectively  reflecting an effective tax rate of percent excluding goodwill impairment of million taken in the second quarter of fiscal year  and percent for the fiscal years ended july  and  respectively

in the first quarter of fiscal year as a result  the company wrote off the excess of revalued net assets over stockholders investment negative goodwill and recognized income of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal year year ended july  compared to year ended july  total revenues 
in fiscal year  the company focused on rebuilding and managing the business through the external volatility of the economy 
the company recorded total revenues of billion in fiscal year  an increase of percent  over total revenues of billion for the prior fiscal year 
comparable store sales increased percent in fiscal year comparable store sales include sales for those stores that were in operation for a full month period in both the current fiscal year and the prior fiscal year 
the more moderate brands led the sales improvements  with the zales brand comparative store sales increasing percent over the prior year 
the high end business was most affected by the uncertain economic environment  with a percent decrease in comparable store sales for the year 
however  this business demonstrated improvement near the end of fiscal year compared to previous quarters 
the revenue increase in comparable stores was attributable to continued strength in the bridal and solitaire categories 
three stone jewelry and signature stones were especially strong sellers 
the company attributes the strength of its diamond categories to improved merchandise quality and selection  along with an enhanced credit offering which has in turn improved the average check across all brands 
the company also believes that inventory management has positively affected sales 
in fiscal year  the company has enhanced its focus on inventory management  adjusting inventory levels based on rate of sales in each store 
this inventory management allowed stores to be in stock on key items  as well as to maintain current inventory levels 
total revenues include insurance premium revenues for credit insurance operations of million and million for fiscal years ended july  and  respectively

in fiscal year  cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was percent  an improvement of percentage points over the same period in the prior year 
cost of sales in fiscal year included a special inventory charge of million  or percent of revenues  in january  to adjust the valuation of certain inventory that was not of a quality consistent with the strategic direction of the company s brands 
cost of sales was positively impacted in fiscal year by the reduced reliance on clearance merchandise and point of sale promotional activity 
this improvement was offset by the higher proportion of sales in the bridal and solitaire categories that have a slightly lower margin rate 
however  management believes the focus on inventory management and narrowing the assortment at certain stores contributes to improved margins by reducing markdowns 
the lifo inventory provision was million for the fiscal year ended july   compared to a million provision in the prior year 
prior to fiscal year  the company used the bureau of labor statistics bls producer price indices applied against inventory values to calculate the value of inventory on a lifo basis 
in fiscal year  the company applied internally developed indices that the company believes more consistently measure inflation or deflation in the components of its merchandise ie  diamonds  gold and other metals and precious stones and its merchandise mix 
the company believes the internally developed indices more accurately reflect inflation or deflation in its own prices than the bls producer price indices 
the impact on the individual prior years presented and the cumulative effect of this change on earnings at the beginning of fiscal year is not determinable 
at the end of fiscal year  the effect of using internal indices instead of the bls s producer price indices was to increase net income by approximately 
table of contents million  or per share 
adjustments to other inventory reserves for slow moving merchandise were million and million for the years ended july  and  respectively

the consensus on eitf should be applied prospectively to new arrangements  or modifications to existing arrangements  entered into as of january  the company has adopted the provisions of the consensus eitf  and that adoption had no impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows for the current reporting periods 
in accordance with eitf  the company is applying the new rules to its renewals of existing contracts that are effective at the beginning of each new fiscal year 
effective in fiscal year  cooperative advertising support received from vendors  which was previously recorded as an offset to advertising expense  will be included as a reduction of the purchase cost of the related inventory and flow through the retail inventory calculation as a reduction in cost of sales as the inventory is sold 
due to the nature of the retail inventory calculation  the inventory turn impact  and the estimated lifo impact of the prospective adoption  this will result in an estimated reduction to earnings per share for fiscal year this adoption is not expected to have a financial impact on future periods after fiscal year in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
the company adopted sfas in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  and the adoption had no impact on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows for the current reporting operations 
inflation in management s opinion  changes in net revenues  net earnings  and inventory valuation that have resulted from inflation and changing prices have not been material during the periods presented 
the trends in inflation rates pertaining to merchandise inventories  especially as they relate to gold and diamond costs  are primary components in determining the company s lifo inventory 
there is no assurance that inflation will not materially affect the company in the future 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
for example  unexpected changes in market conditions or a downturn in the economy could adversely affect actual results 
estimates are used in accounting for  among other things  inventory obsolescence  goodwill and long lived asset valuation  lifo inventory retail method  legal liability  credit insurance liability  product warranty  depreciation  employee benefits  taxes  and contingencies 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
substantially all us inventories represent finished goods which are valued using the last in  first out lifo retail inventory method 
merchandise inventory of peoples jewellers of canada is valued using the first in  first out fifo retail inventory method 
under the retail method  inventory is segregated into categories of merchandise with similar characteristics at its current retail selling value 
the determination of inventory at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying an average cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventory 
the company is required to determine the lifo cost on an interim basis by estimating annual inflation trends  annual purchases and ending inventory levels for the fiscal year 
actual annual inflation rates and inventory balances as of the end of any fiscal year may differ from interim estimates 
prior to fiscal year  the company used the bureau of 
table of contents labor statistics bls producer price indices applied against inventory values to calculate the value of inventory on a lifo basis 
in fiscal year  the company applied internally developed indices that the company believes more consistently measure inflation or deflation in the components of its merchandise ie  diamonds  gold and other metals and precious stones and its merchandise mix 
the company believes the internally developed indices more accurately reflect inflation or deflation in its own prices than the bls producer price indices 
the impact on the individual prior years presented and the cumulative effect of this change on earnings at the beginning of fiscal year was not determinable 
at the end of fiscal year  the effect of using internal indices instead of the bls producer price indices was to increase net income by approximately million  or per share 
the company also writes down its inventory for discontinued  slow moving and damaged inventory 
this write down is equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value based upon assumptions of targeted inventory turn rates  future demand  management strategy  and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or management strategy changes  additional inventory write downs may be required and  in the case of a major change in strategy or downturn in market conditions  such write downs could be significant 
shrinkage is estimated for the period from the last inventory date to the end of the fiscal year on a store by store basis 
such estimates are based on experience and the shrinkage results from the last physical inventory 
physical inventories are taken at least twice annually for all store locations and annually for the distribution centers 
the shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory  in combination with historical experience  is the basis for providing a shrinkage reserve 
long lived assets and goodwill long lived assets are periodically reviewed for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets with their estimated fair values 
if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  the potential impairment is measured based on a projected discounted cashflow method  using a discount rate that is considered to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the company s current business model 
assumptions are made with respect to cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets based upon updated projections 
any changes in key assumptions or market conditions could result in an unanticipated impairment charge 
for instance  in the event of a major market downturn  individual stores may become unprofitable  which could result in a write down of the carrying value of the assets located in those stores 
any impairment would be recognized in operating results if a permanent reduction were to occur 
goodwill  which represents the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired  is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis  or when there is reason to believe that the value has been diminished or impaired 
the fair value of the company s identified reporting units was estimated using the expected present value of corresponding future cash flows and market values of comparable businesses where available 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company tests goodwill for impairment annually  at the end of its second quarter  or more frequently if events occur which indicate a potential reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit s net assets below its carrying value 
an impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  the company performed its annual review for impairment of goodwill related to its piercing pagoda  people s and other smaller acquisitions 
the company has concluded that there is no evidence of impairment related to the goodwill of approximately million recorded for the people s acquisition and million for other smaller acquisitions 
to perform the impairment test for piercing pagoda  the company engaged an independent third party valuation firm 
this firm calculated the estimated fair value of piercing pagoda using the expected present value of corresponding future cash flows and fair market values of comparable businesses where available 
the calculation indicated that the fair value of piercing pagoda was lower than its carrying value  reflective of the current market conditions and lower than expected performance 
the company recorded a non cash charge of million in the second quarter of fiscal year  which is included as a component of operating earnings in the consolidated statement of operations  to reduce the carrying value of the piercing pagoda goodwill to approximately million 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
revenue related to merchandise sales  which is approximately ninety five percent of total revenues is recognized at the time of the sale  reduced by a provision for returns 
the provision for sales returns is based on historical evidence of the company s return rate 
repair revenues are recognized when the service is complete and the merchandise is delivered to the customers 
total revenues include extended service agreements which are recognized over the period the services are performed 
revenues also include premiums from the company s insurance businesses  principally related to credit 
table of contents insurance policies sold to customers who purchase the company s merchandise under the proprietary credit program 
insurance premiums are recognized over the coverage period 
other reserves the company is involved in a number of legal and governmental proceedings as part of the normal course of business 
reserves are established based on management s best estimates of the company s potential liability in these matters 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with in house and outside counsel and are based on a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
income taxes are estimated for each jurisdiction in which the company operates 
this involves assessing the current tax exposure together with temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement accounting purposes 
any resulting deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability based on estimated future taxable income 
to the extent that recovery is deemed not likely  a valuation allowance is recorded 
the company believes that as of july  the realization of the deferred income tax asset is more likely than not  and thus there was no valuation reserve recorded
