item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those that relate to depreciable lives  goodwill and debt covenants 
the estimates and judgments made by management are based on historical data and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of operations fiscal year ended february  february  february  revenues food and beverage amusements and other total revenues costs and expenses cost of revenues operating payroll and benefits other store operating general and administrative depreciation and amortization preopening costs total costs and expenses operating income interest expense fiscal year ended february  february  february  income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes income before cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle net income loss management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
depreciable lives expenditures for new facilities and those that substantially increase the useful lives of the property  including interest during construction  are capitalized along with equipment purchases at cost 
these costs are depreciated over various methods based on an estimate of the depreciable life  resulting in a charge to the operating results of the company 
the actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the depreciable lives are as follows property and equipment games years buildings years furniture  fixtures and equipment to years leasehold and building improvements shorter of years or lease life intangible assets trademarks over statutory lives lease rights over remaining lease term goodwill the company applied the financial accounting standards board statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statements  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  in the first quarter of under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
applying the new standards resulted in a one time charge of  representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the write off of goodwill resulted in a charge to earnings of 
per diluted share for the year 
our adoption of sfas resulted in approximately less gross amortization expense for fiscal see the discussion in note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the effect of adopting sfas the remaining intangible asset  the trademark  is insignificant 
debt covenants the company s credit facility requires compliance with certain financial covenants including a minimum consolidated tangible net worth level  maximum leverage ratio  minimum fixed charge coverage and maximum level of capital expenditures 
on march   amendment no 
was executed to provide revised financial covenants  thereby enabling the company to remain in compliance with the agreement 
the amendment further amended the fixed charge coverage ratio for the remaining term of the agreement 
the company believes the results of operations for the fiscal year ending february  and thereafter would enable the company to remain in compliance with the existing covenants absent any material negative event affecting the us economy as a whole 
however  the company s expectations of future operating results and continued compliance with the debt covenants cannot be assured and the lenders actions are not controllable by the company 
if the projections of future operating results are not achieved and the debt is placed in default  the company would experience a material adverse impact on its reported financial position and results of operations
