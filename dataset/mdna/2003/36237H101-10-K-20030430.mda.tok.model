the following presentation of management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements  the accompanying notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
references to fiscal years refer to the year ended or ending january of that year 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period 
significant accounting policies employed by us  including the use of estimates  are presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and the results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies  discussed below  pertain to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  inventories and income taxes 
in applying these policies  management must use some amounts that are based upon its informed judgments and best estimates 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer allowances and discounts  product returns  bad debts and inventories 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize a sale at the time merchandise is shipped 
we also act as an agent in brokering sales between our customers and overseas factories 
on these transactions  we recognize commission fee income on the sales that are financed by and shipped directly to our customers 
this income is also recorded at the time the merchandise is shipped 
net sales take into account reserves for returns and allowances which are based on current and historical information and trends 
sales are reported net of returns  discounts and allowances 
discounts  allowances and estimates of future returns are recognized when the related revenues are recognized 
accounts receivable in the normal course of business  we extend credit to our customers based on pre defined credit criteria 
accounts receivable  as shown on our consolidated balance sheet  are net of allowances and anticipated discounts 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit sources  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
for all other customers  an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of collectability based on historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of economic conditions 
an allowance for discounts is based on reviews of open invoices where concessions have been extended to customers 
costs associated with allowable deductions for customer advertising expenses are charged to advertising expenses in the selling  general and administrative section of the statements of income 
costs associated with markdowns and other operational charge backs  net of historical recoveries  are included as a reduction of net sales 
all of these are part of the allowances included in accounts receivable 
we reserve against known charge backs  as well as for an estimate of potential future customer deductions 
these provisions result from divisional seasonal negotiations  as well as historical deduction trends  net of historical recoveries and the evaluation of current market conditions 
inventories inventories are stated at lower of cost using the first in  first out method or market 
we continually evaluate the composition of our inventories  assessing slow turning  ongoing product as well as fashion product from prior seasons 
market value of distressed inventory is valued based on historical sales trends of our individual product lines  the impact of market trends and economic conditions  and the value of current orders relating to the future sales of this type of inventory 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected operating data as a percentage of our net sales for the fiscal years indicated below net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses unusual or non recurring charge operating profit interest and financing charges  net income before minority interest and income taxes minority interest in income of joint venture income before income taxes income taxes net income general we operate our business in two segments  non licensed apparel and licensed apparel 
the non licensed apparel segment includes sales of apparel under our own brands and private label brands  as well as commission fee income received on sales that are financed by and shipped directly to our customers 
the licensed apparel segment includes sales of apparel brands licensed by us from third parties 
see note m to our consolidated financial statements for financial information with respect to these segments 
in december  due to rapidly rising costs and losses associated with our indonesian facility  as well as the political and economic instability in indonesia  we decided to close our factory in indonesia 
the loss from the factory s operations prior to the closedown and the charge taken in connection with the closing of our facility had a negative effect on our results of operations for fiscal the results for the fiscal quarter and year ended january   include charges aggregating million million on an after tax basis in connection with this closedown 
in our income statement  million of these charges is included in unusual or non recurring charges and  of these charges is included in cost of goods sold 
the tragic events of september  aggravated a retail environment that had already begun to slow down due to the economic downturn in the united states 
the resulting uncertainty with respect to consumer spending caused our customers to slow the pace of reorders during what is the seasonal peak of our business 
retailers responded to this environment with increased promotional activity which required us to grant greater allowances and discounts in order to sell our products 
these factors  as well as the unseasonably warm weather that continued throughout the fall and winter seasons had a negative effect on our results of operations for fiscal during fiscal  together with black entertainment television bet  our joint venture partner  we decided to discontinue the bet design studio joint venture

gross profit for non licensed apparel was million in fiscal  or of net sales of non licensed apparel  compared to million in fiscal  or of net sales of non licensed apparel 
the decrease in gross profit for non licensed apparel was primarily a result of losses at the indonesian facility prior to its closedown  and the portion  of the aggregate charges relating to the closedown of the indonesian subsidiary that was included in cost of goods sold
