item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s revenues are derived from product sales  which include both licenses of the dct  mgts and lance system software and sales of dct  mgts and lance hardware  and from services  which include customer support under hardware and software support contracts as well as installation and training 
prices for the dct  mgts and lance systems vary widely depending upon overall system configuration  including the number and type of software protocol modules and the number of physical interfaces required by the customer 
a dct or mgts system sale typically ranges in price from approximately  to over  and a lance system sale from approximately  to  in addition to the initial system purchase  customers also may upgrade their systems by purchasing additional software protocol modules and hardware 
customers have the option to purchase a third party workstation or pc from the company or provide a workstation or pc to the company for configuration 
product sales are recognized upon shipment or  if installation services are purchased  when installation is complete  provided collection is probable 
the company offers product warranties for various lengths of time  depending on the product and country of purchase or operation 
customers may elect to purchase an annual software support contract which includes both ongoing technical support and any new software releases on a when and if available basis during the term of the support contract 
these software releases may include updates for protocols already licensed by the customer 
revenues from software support contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period  which is generally one year 
new customers often purchase onsite training  which is charged on a fixed price basis and recognized when the training is complete 
critical accounting policies the company has identified the accounting policies below as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on its business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect the company s reported and expected future financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition sales of the company s product arrangements normally include hardware and software 
certain of the company s sales may also include installation 
the company also offers training and maintenance services 
the company recognizes revenue on system sales upon shipment or when installation is complete  if installation services are purchased  provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
training and maintenance revenues are based on the company s established history of charging separate fees for training and maintenance 
revenues allocated to training are recognized at the time the training is complete 
revenues allocated to maintenance are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract 
foreign exchange risk and derivative financial instruments the company s foreign subsidiaries operate and sell the company s products in various global markets 
as a result  the company is exposed to changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated sales made to foreign subsidiaries 
the company utilizes foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options to hedge against future movements in foreign exchange rates that affect certain foreign currency denominated inter company receivables 
the company attempts to match the forward contracts with the underlying receivables being hedged in terms of currency  amount and maturity 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the cost of options and any gains or losses on forward contracts are included in other income expense 

table of contents use of estimates  allowance for doubtful accounts the preparation of financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
the company specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debt experience  customer concentration  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s accounts receivable balance as of september  was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the company s actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within its consolidated balance sheet 
the company then assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  establishes a valuation allowance 
to the extent that the company establishes or increases a valuation allowance in a period  the change is included as an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
goodwill and long lived assets effective october   the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization and an annual impairment test 
the company performed its most recent annual impairment test on september   showing no impairment of goodwill  and will continue to perform this test annually using the methodology described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
for assets to be held and used  including acquired intangibles  the company initiates a review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparing its carrying value to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
any impairment is measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the projected discounted future operating cash flows 
assets to be disposed of and that the company has committed to a plan to dispose of  whether through sale or abandonment  are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 
fiscal years ended september  and revenues  cost of revenues and operating expenses for the year ended september  include a full months of the results of the continuing operations of ndb 
the corresponding figures for the year ended september  include one month of the results of the continuing operations of ndb from august   the date it was acquired by the company  and exclude the results of the discontinued distribution and consulting businesses engaged in by tekelec limited in japan as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenues total revenues increased by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal despite the additional mgts revenues resulting from the ndb acquisition  product revenues increased by only approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to prevailing market 
table of contents weakness that negatively affected shipments of both dct and mgts products 
services revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to the increase in the number of systems under maintenance  primarily as a result of the ndb acquisition 
cost of revenues cost of product revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross margin on product revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal both the increase in cost of product revenues and the decrease in gross margin on product revenues reflected two factors first  the higher cost of goods on the more hardware intensive mgts product in comparison with the dct product  and second  the additional manufacturing costs incurred on mgts product during the six month period ended february  when this product was manufactured for the company by tekelec under a transitional services agreement 
cost of services revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of a corresponding increase in the costs of customer support personnel due to the ndb acquisition 
gross margin on services revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal as the cost of providing services revenues  consisting primarily of compensation costs  grew more than the associated revenues 
gross margin on services revenues may also vary depending on the timing of system sales and support contract renewals 
amortization of purchased technology increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal reflecting a full months of amortization in the latter year in comparison with a single month in the former 
research and development research and development expenses increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to a corresponding increase in compensation and other costs associated with ndb research and development activities 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the company expects the absolute annual level of research and development expenses to decrease by approximately in fiscal as a result of reductions made during fiscal in the number of employees and contractors engaged in research and development activities 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of two factors an increase of approximately million in compensation and other associated costs due to an increase in the number of personnel engaged in sales and marketing activities as a result of the ndb acquisition  and an increase of approximately  in the cost of sales and marketing activities outside the united states due to an increase in the values of the foreign currencies in which this cost is incurred 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased from of revenues in fiscal to in fiscal general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was due to four factors an increase of  in facilities costs due primarily to the ndb acquisition  an increase of  in compensation costs due to an increase in the number of personnel engaged in the performance of general and administrative activities  an increase of  in premiums for general liability  directors and officers and workers compensation insurance  and an increase of  in non cash amortization of acquisition related intangibles 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses increased from to over the same period 
the company expects the absolute annual level of general and administrative expenses to increase by up to approximately in fiscal due to increased regulatory compliance costs 

table of contents restructuring costs a restructuring charge of  was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to costs associated with the involuntary termination of employees  including in research and development  in sales and marketing  in the customer service component of services cost of goods and in the manufacturing component of product cost of goods 
the terminations represented of the company s pre termination workforce 
no restructuring charge was recorded in fiscal purchased in process research and development in fiscal  million in purchased in process research and development was charged to operating expenses 
this amount represented two ndb research and development projects in process as of august   the date of the acquisition of ndb 
the value of these projects was determined by an independent appraiser using established valuation techniques and was expensed because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed as of the date of acquisition 
there was no expense recorded in fiscal for purchased in process research and development 
interest income interest income decreased from million in fiscal to  in fiscal due to lower cash and short term investment balances resulting from the million paid on closing of the ndb acquisition and lower prevailing rates of return  partially offset by amortization of  of the convertible note valuation premium in fiscal in comparison with  in fiscal interest expense interest expense increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal due to a corresponding increase in interest accrued on the convertible notes payable 
other income expense  net other income improved from an expense of  in fiscal to income of million in fiscal due to two factors foreign exchange gains recorded in fiscal in contrast with the foreign exchange losses in fiscal and the receipt in fiscal of a japanese consumption tax refund in the amount of approximately  income taxes the company recorded a benefit from income taxes of million in fiscal as a result of three factors the identification of approximately  in additional taxes recoverable from a previous period  a reduction of approximately  in the estimated tax payable at the end of the fiscal year as a result of the likely favorable outcome of a tax audit of the company s japanese subsidiary  and the recognition of approximately  in future tax benefits of foreign tax credits created in the liquidation of the japanese subsidiary acquired from tekelec 
as a result  the company s effective tax rate changed from a provision of in fiscal to a benefit of in fiscal fiscal years ended september  and revenues  cost of revenues and operating expenses for the year ended september  include the results of the continuing operations of ndb from august   the date it was acquired by the company and exclude the results of the discontinued distribution and consulting businesses engaged in by tekelec limited in japan as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

services revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to the increase in the number of systems under maintenance and to the inclusion of one month of revenues from mgts services in fiscal cost of revenues cost of product revenues decreased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross margin on product revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase in gross profit margin occurred despite the inclusion of one month of revenues from the lower margin mgts product in the latter year  and reflected lower cost of goods on the hardware component of the company s dct product 
cost of services revenues increased by approximately from  in fiscal to million in fiscal due to increases in the number of customer support personnel and the associated costs 
gross margin on services revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal as the cost of providing services revenues  consisting primarily of compensation costs  grew more than the associated revenues 
gross margin on services revenues may also vary depending on the timing of system sales and support contract renewals 
amortization of purchased technology in the amount of  was recorded in fiscal  reflecting one month of amortization of the ndb technology 
no amortization of purchased technology was recorded in fiscal research and development research and development expenses increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due primarily to higher compensation costs resulting from a significant increase in the number of personnel engaged in research and development 
this increase in research and development personnel reflected both the addition of employees throughout fiscal and the personnel who joined with the acquisition of ndb one month prior to the end of fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses increased from to over the same 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses remained unchanged at million from fiscal to fiscal as the addition of one month of expenses related to ndb sales and marketing expenses was offset by a reduction in the number of non ndb personnel engaged in sales and marketing as well and by a reduction in variable compensation expense 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses remained unchanged at of revenues from fiscal to fiscal general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease was due primarily to decreases in performance related bonuses  recruitment costs and legal fees 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased from to over the same period 
purchased in process research and development in fiscal  million in purchased in process research and development was charged to operating expenses 
this amount represented two ndb research and development projects in process as of august   the date of the acquisition of ndb 
the value of these projects was determined by an independent appraiser using established valuation techniques and was expensed because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed as of the date of acquisition 

table of contents interest income interest income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to lower prevailing rates of return 
interest expense interest expense of  was recorded in fiscal reflecting interest accrued on the convertible notes payable 
no interest expense was recorded in fiscal other expense other expense decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal due to reduced foreign exchange losses  including losses realized on forward contracts entered into which were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  and to the absence in fiscal of a million loss incurred in fiscal on a sale of a marketable security 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease reflects an increase in the percentage of pre tax income derived from international operations by the company s irish subsidiary  which is subject to a lower income tax rate than the us parent company 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has financed its operations primarily through cash generated from operations and from the proceeds of its initial public offering completed in early the proceeds to the company from the offering  net of underwriter fees and other expenses  were approximately million 
the company s purchase of ndb was additionally financed through the issuance of two convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the convertible notes were issued by the company s irish subsidiary and are guaranteed by the company 
the notes are convertible at the option of the holder into an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock subject to adjustment for certain events between august  and the maturity date of august  if not converted by the holder  the company is entitled to pay the principal and accrued interest on one of the notes in the principal amount of million in cash or  in whole or in part  by issuing its common stock at a value of of the fair market value of the stock determined by a formula set forth in the note 
the company s operating activities provided cash of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  the major component of cash from operating activities was net income 
in  cash generated by net income was further increased by million in changes in working capital components  including an increase in accrued liabilities in that amount  and by adjustments to net cash provided by operating activities of million in non cash charges for depreciation  amortization  purchased in process research and development and deferred income taxes 
in  cash generated by net income was reduced by changes in working capital components  the largest of which was a million reduction in accrued liabilities 
the company s primary source of operating cash flow is the collection of accounts receivable from its customers and the timing of payments to its vendors and service providers 
the company measures the effectiveness of its collections efforts by an analysis of average accounts receivable days outstanding days outstanding 
collections of accounts receivable and related days outstanding will fluctuate in future periods due to the timing and amount of its future revenues  payment terms extended to its customers and the effectiveness of its collection efforts 
investing activities  consisting primarily of purchases and sales of short term investments  additions to property and equipment and the acquisition of ndb  provided cash of million in fiscal and used cash of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 

table of contents financing activities provided cash of million and  in fiscal and  respectively  from the exercise of stock options and the sale of shares under the employee stock purchase plan 
financing activities used cash of million in fiscal as the value of common stock repurchased exceeded the value issued 
as of september   the company had working capital of million  cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
as of september   the company had the following contractual obligations  in millions payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years principal and interest payable under convertible notes operating leases total contractual cash obligations the company expects that capital expenditures will total approximately million in fiscal the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its liquidity or cash requirements 
the company may require additional funds to support its working capital requirements or for other purposes 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available or that if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to the company or its stockholders 
the company believes that cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and funds generated from operations will provide the company with sufficient funds to finance its requirements for at least the next months  including the repayment of the convertible notes payable in the event that they are not converted 
factors that may affect future results the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report on form k are important factors that may affect future results and that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements that may be made by the company from time to time 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results  lengthy sales cycle the company has experienced  and anticipates that it will continue to experience  significant fluctuations in quarterly revenues and operating results 
the company s revenues and operating results are relatively difficult to forecast for a number of reasons  including i the variable size and timing of individual purchases by customers  ii seasonal factors that may affect capital spending by customers  such as the varying fiscal year ends of customers and the reduction in business during the summer months  particularly in europe  iii the relatively long sales cycles for the company s products  iv the timing of hiring sales and technical personnel  v changes in timing and amount of sales incentive compensation  vi competitive conditions in the company s markets  vii exchange rate fluctuations  viii changes in the mix of products sold  ix the timing of the introduction and market acceptance of new products or product enhancements by the company  its customers  competitors or suppliers  x costs associated with developing and introducing new products  xi product life cycles  xii changes in the level of operating expenses relative to revenues  xiii software defects and other product quality problems  xiv customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  xv delays in purchasing decisions or customer orders due to customer consolidation  xvi supply interruptions  xvii changes in the regulatory environment and xviii changes in global or regional economic conditions or in the telecommunications industry 
the company s revenues in any period generally have been  and are likely to continue to be  derived from relatively small numbers of sales and service transactions with relatively high average revenues per order 
therefore  the loss of any orders or delays in closing such transactions could have a more significant impact on the company s quarterly revenues and results of operations than on those of companies with relatively high 
table of contents volumes of sales or low revenues per order 
see dependence on limited number of customers below 
the company s products generally are shipped within to days after orders are received and revenues are recognized upon shipment or  if installation services are purchased  when installed  provided collection is probable 
as a result  the company generally does not have a significant backlog of orders  and revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked  shipped and installed in that quarter 
due to the relatively fixed nature of most of the company s costs  including personnel and facilities costs  and because operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue  a decline in revenue from even a limited number of transactions  failure to achieve expected revenue in any fiscal quarter or unanticipated variations in the timing of recognition of specific revenues can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and may in some future quarter result in losses or have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes  therefore  that period to period comparisons of its operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
for all of the foregoing factors  as well as other unanticipated factors  it is possible that in some future quarter  the company s results of operations could fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in such event  or in the event that adverse conditions prevail or are perceived to prevail generally or with respect to the company s business  the price of the company s common stock will likely be materially adversely affected 
dependence on limited number of customers the company s customer base is highly concentrated  and a relatively small number of companies have accounted for substantially all of the company s revenues to date 
in the fiscal year ended september   the company s top five customers represented approximately of total revenues 
the company expects that it will continue to depend upon a relatively limited number of customers for substantially all of its revenues in future periods  although no customer is presently obligated either to purchase a specific amount of products or to provide the company with binding forecasts of purchases for any period 
the loss of a major customer or the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more of the company s significant customers could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks relating to acquisitions as part of its business strategy  the company acquired ndb on august  and may make further acquisitions of  or significant investments in  companies  products or technologies that it believes are complementary  although no such acquisitions or investments are currently pending 
the ndb acquisition and any such future transactions would be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in making acquisitions of companies  products and technologies 
such risks include  among others  the difficulties associated with assimilating the personnel and operations of acquired companies  the potential disruption of the company s ongoing business  the distraction of management and other resources  the integration of personnel and technology of an acquired company  difficulties in evaluating the technology of a potential target  inability to motivate and retain new personnel  the maintenance of uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies and the impairment of relationships with employees and clients as a result of the integration of new management personnel 
the company has no experience in assimilating acquired companies or product lines into its operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with the ndb acquisition or any such future acquisitions 
furthermore  future acquisitions by the company could result in the issuance of dilutive equity securities  the incurrence of debt or contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operation or on the market price of the company s common stock 

table of contents stock market fluctuations in recent years  the stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular  including the company s common stock  have experienced extreme price fluctuations 
the market price of the company s common stock may be significantly affected by various factors such as quarterly variations in the company s operating results  changes in revenue growth rates for the company as a whole or for specific geographic areas or products  changes in earning estimates by market analysts  the announcements of new products or product enhancements by the company or its competitors  speculation in the press or analyst community and general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries 
there can be no assurance that the market price of the company s common stock will not experience significant fluctuations in the future 
risk associated with international operations international sales and operations are subject to inherent risks  including difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer customer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  changes in regulatory requirements or in economic or trade policy  costs related to localizing products for foreign countries  potentially weaker protection for intellectual property in certain foreign countries  the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and practices  tariffs and other trade barriers and potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on repatriation of earnings 
during the last three fiscal years  a significant portion of the company s sales has been to customers in japan 
if economic conditions in japan remain weak  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
an inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals in foreign markets on a timely basis could also have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of the company s international sales  including its sales in japan  are denominated in local currencies 
although the company currently engages in hedging transactions with respect to certain receivables resulting from certain inter company sales  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to do so or that its hedging activities will be successful 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may contribute to fluctuations in the company s operating results 
for example  changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect the revenues  net income  earnings per share and cash flow of the company s operations in affected markets 
similarly  such fluctuations may cause the company to raise prices  which could affect demand for the company s products and services 
in addition  if exchange or price controls or other restrictions are imposed in countries in which the company does business  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
management of growth the company s growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  significant demands on its management  administrative and operational resources 
to manage expansion effectively  the company needs to continue to develop and improve its operational and financial systems  sales and marketing capabilities and expand  train  retain  manage and motivate its employee base 
some of the company s senior management have not previously managed a business of the company s size  and these individuals have limited experience managing a public company 
there can be no assurance that the company s systems  procedures or controls will be adequate to support the company s operations or that the company s management will be able to successfully exploit future market opportunities or successfully manage the company s relationships with customers and other third parties 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to grow or  if it does  that the company will effectively manage such growth 
any failure to manage growth would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on customer outsourcing of test systems the company s success will depend on continued growth in the market for telecommunications test systems and services and the continued commercial acceptance of the company s products as a solution to 
table of contents address the testing requirements of telecommunications equipment manufacturers and network operators 
while most of the company s present and potential customers have the technical capability and financial resources to produce their own test systems and perform test services internally  to date  many have chosen to outsource a substantial proportion of their test system and service requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company s customers will continue  or that new customers will choose  to outsource any of their test systems and service requirements or that the company s products and services will be widely adopted 
if the market for telecommunications test systems and services  or the demand for outsourcing  declines or fails to grow  or if the company s products and services are not widely adopted as a telecommunications test solution  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
competitive market the market for the company s products is highly competitive 
many of the company s competitors are better known and have substantially greater financial  technological  production and marketing resources than the company 
while the company believes that the price performance characteristics of its products are competitive  price competition in the markets for the company s products is intense 
any material reduction in the price of the company s products without corresponding decreases in manufacturing costs and increases in unit volume would negatively affect gross margins  which could in turn have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
increased competition for the company s products that results in lower product sales could also adversely impact the company s upgrade sales 
the company s ability to maintain its competitive position will depend upon  among other factors  its success in anticipating industry trends  investing in product research and development  developing new products with improved price performance characteristics and effectively managing the introduction of new products into targeted markets 
dependence on rapidly evolving telecommunications industry the company s future success is dependent upon the continued growth of the telecommunications industry 
the global telecommunications industry is evolving rapidly  and it is difficult to predict its potential growth rate or future trends in technology development 
there can be no assurance that the deregulation  privatization and economic globalization of the worldwide telecommunications market that have resulted in increased competition and escalating demand for new technologies and services will continue in a manner favorable to the company or its business strategies 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the growth in demand for internet services and the resulting need for high speed or enhanced telecommunications equipment will continue at its current rate or at all 
the company s future success is dependent upon the increased utilization of its test solutions by network operators and telecommunications equipment manufacturers 
industry wide network equipment and infrastructure development driving the demand for the company s products and services may be delayed or prevented by a variety of factors  including cost  regulatory obstacles or the lack of or reduction in consumer demand for advanced telecommunications products and services 
there can be no assurance that telecommunications equipment manufacturers and network operators will develop new technology or enhance current technology or  if developed  that such new technology or enhancements will create demand for the company s products or services 
dependence on key personnel the company s future growth and success depends to a significant extent upon the continuing services of its executive officers and other key employees 
the company does not have long term employment agreements or non competition agreements with any of its employees 
competition for qualified management and other high level telecommunications industry personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
the loss of services of any key employees would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company maintains  and is the beneficiary of  a key person life insurance policy in the amount

rapid technological change  uncertainty of acceptance of the company s products and services the market for telecommunications test systems and services is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  rapid changes in customer requirements and frequent product and service introductions and enhancements 
the company s future success will depend in part on its ability to anticipate and respond to these changes by enhancing its existing products and services and by developing and introducing  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products  features and services that address the needs of its customer base 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in identifying  developing and marketing new products  product enhancements and related services that respond to technological change or evolving industry standards or that adequately meet new market demands 
in addition  because of the rapid technological change characteristic of the telecommunications industry  the company may be required to support legacy systems used by its customers  which may place additional demands on the company s personnel and other resources and may require the company to maintain an inventory of otherwise obsolete components 
the company s test systems currently operate only on the sun unix and the linux operating systems 
the company s current and prospective customers may require other operating systems  such as windows or windows xp  to be used in their telecommunications test systems or may require the integration of other industry standards 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to successfully adapt its products to such operating systems on a timely or cost effective basis  if at all 
the failure of the company to respond to rapidly changing technologies and to develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s success will depend in part on whether a large number of telecommunications equipment manufacturers and network operators purchase the company s products and services 
because the telecommunications market is rapidly evolving  it is difficult to predict the future success of products and services in this market 
the customers in this market use products from a number of competing suppliers for various testing purposes  and there has not been broad adoption of the products of one company 
there can be no assurance that the company s current or future products or services will achieve widespread acceptance among telecommunications equipment manufacturers  network operators or other potential customers or that solutions developed by competitors will not render the company s products obsolete or uncompetitive 
in the event the telecommunications industry does not broadly adopt the company s products or services or does so less rapidly than expected by the company  or in the event the company s products are rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by more advanced solutions  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
dependence on sole and single source suppliers the company purchases many key components  including certain microprocessors  workstations  bus interface and other chips  connectors and other hardware  from the sole supplier of a particular component 
for other components  even though multiple vendors may exist  the company may purchase components from only a single source 
the company does not have any long term supply agreements with these vendors to ensure uninterrupted supply of these components 
in the event of a reduction or interruption in the supply of a key component  a significant amount of time could be required to qualify alternative suppliers and receive an adequate flow of replacement components 
reconfiguration of the company s products to adapt to new components may also be required and could entail substantial time and expense 
in addition  the process of manufacturing certain of these components is extremely complex  and the company s reliance on the suppliers of these components exposes the company to potential production difficulties and quality variations  which could negatively affect cost and timely delivery of the company s products 
the company has from time to time in the past experienced supply problems as a result of the financial or operational difficulties of its suppliers  shortages and discontinuations resulting from component obsolescence 
although the company  to 
table of contents date  has not experienced material delays in product deliveries to its customers resulting from such supply problems  there can be no assurance that supply problems will not recur or  if such problems do recur  that satisfactory solutions would be found 
any prolonged inability to obtain adequate amounts of fully functional components or any other circumstances that would require the company to seek alternative sources of supply could have a material adverse effect on the company s relationship with its customers as well as on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on third party manufacturers the company relies on a limited number of independent manufacturers  some of which are small  privately held companies  to provide certain assembly services to the company s specifications 
the company does not have any long term supply agreements with any third party manufacturer 
in the event of a reduction or interruption in assembly services to the company  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected until the company was able to establish sufficient assembly services supply from alternative sources 
there can be no assurance that alternative manufacturing sources will be able to meet the company s future requirements or that existing or alternative sources will continue to be available to the company at favorable prices

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s foreign exchange risk and derivative financial instruments the company s foreign subsidiaries operate and sell the company s products in various global markets 
as a result  the company is exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on foreign currency denominated sales made to foreign subsidiaries 
the company utilizes foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options to hedge against future movements in foreign exchange rates that affect certain foreign currency denominated inter company receivables 
the company attempts to match the forward contracts with the underlying receivables being hedged in terms of currency  amount and maturity 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
because the impact of movements in currency exchange rates on forward contracts offsets the related impact on the exposures hedged  these financial instruments do not subject the company to speculative risk that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
realized gains and losses on forward exchange contracts offset foreign exchange transaction gains or losses from revaluation of foreign currency denominated inter company receivable balances which otherwise would be charged to other income expense 
to date  the company has not fully hedged all risk associated with its sales denominated in foreign currencies  and there can be no assurance that the company s hedging activities  if any  will be successful 
at september   the company had forward exchange contracts maturing in fiscal to sell approximately  in japanese yen designed to hedge against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
the fair market value of these contracts and options at september  was not material

if the market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of september   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material to the company s financial position
