business overview for almost years  zarlink semiconductor has delivered the integrated circuit ic building blocks that drive the capabilities of voice  enterprise  broadband and wireless communications 
management believes that the company s success is built on its technology strengths encompassing voice and data networks  consumer and ultra low power communications  and high performance analog 
at march   the company employed  people worldwide  including designers 
the company segments its business as network communications  consumer communications and ultra low power communications 
the company previously reported its business segments as communications and medical 
the change in segments resulted from the evolution of the company s business model and growth strategies along the lines of these three segments 
network communications was previously known as network access and was part of the communications segment 
consumer communications was previously known as user access and was also part of the communications segment 
the ultra low power communications segment  previously known as medical  now better reflects the expanded opportunities arising in healthcare and communications from the company s ultra low power expertise 
the following discussion and analysis explains trends in zarlink s financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended march   compared with the two previous fiscal years 
this discussion is intended to help shareholders and other readers understand the dynamics of zarlink s business and the key factors underlying its financial results 
the consolidated financial statements  notes to the consolidated financial statements and supplementary information constitute an integral part of  and should be read in conjunction with  this management s discussion and analysis 
results of operations summary of results from operations millions of us dollars  except per share amounts consolidated revenue network communications consumer communications ultra low power communications operating income loss from continuing operations network communications consumer communications ultra low power communications unallocated income costs net loss from continuing operations net loss per common share from continuing operations basic net loss net loss per common share basic weighted average common shares outstanding millions fiscal revenue decreased by  or  from fiscal the decrease in revenue was due to lower sales volumes  caused by the continued downturn in the semiconductor industry  in the consumer communications segment  principally in cellular wireless  and in the audiologic component market within the ultra low power communications segment 
higher channel inventory levels and lower end customer demand continued to keep sales levels suppressed during the year  however increased customer bookings are beginning to show an indication of improved inventory positions with customers 
revenue in fiscal decreased by  or  from revenue in fiscal the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was due to lower network and consumer communication semiconductor sales volumes caused by a prolonged slump that was widely recognized as the sharpest downturn in the history of the semiconductor industry 
in fiscal  the company recorded a net loss from continuing operations of  or per share 
this compares to a net loss from continuing operations of  or per share  in fiscal the fiscal net loss included a recovery of stock compensation expense of  as well as an non cash write down of its investment in mitel networks and the impact of settling a defined benefit pension plan in the united kingdom 
the company also incurred of mostly non cash foreign exchange charges  principally related to holding significant us dollar cash balances in the canadian parent company 
this was partially offset by reductions in accruals related to prior years exit activities amounting to and by a cash settlement gain of on the early termination of a lease by a tenant 
the fiscal net loss included a special inventory write down of  special charges of related to restructuring and asset impairments  stock compensation expense of  a loss on the sale of the bromont foundry  amortization of acquired intangibles of  and a write off of related to the company s investment in optenia  inc which ceased to operate 
in fiscal  the net loss from continuing operations was  or per share  after the amortization of acquired intangibles of and a pre tax charge for the impairment of goodwill and its fabrication facilities totaling zarlink s operations are comprised of three reportable business segments network communications  consumer communications  and ultra low power communications 
zarlink s network communications segment specializes in voice and data network products  while the consumer communications segment offers semiconductor solutions for wireless handsets and digital set top boxes 
zarlink s ultra low power communications business provides asic and assp solutions for applications such as pacemakers  hearing aids  portable instruments  and personal area communication devices 
zarlink sells its products through both direct and indirect channels of distribution 
factors affecting the choice of distribution include  among others  end customer type  the level of product complexity  the stage of product introduction  geographic presence and location of markets  and volume levels 
network communications millions of us dollars revenue as a of total revenue operating loss zarlink s network communications products provide connectivity to the enterprise and metropolitan markets through feeder  aggregation and transmission applications and products that address the multi protocol physical and network layers 
in simple terms  network communications semiconductor products connect network equipment together 
revenue for fiscal totaled  up from in fiscal and down from in fiscal revenue continued to be adversely affected by customer and channel inventory adjustments  a trend that began during the second half of fiscal and continued through fiscal the revenue growth in fiscal was partially offset by the loss of foundry revenue resulting from the disposal of two complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos fabrication facilities in the fourth quarter of fiscal the segment s operating loss improved to in fiscal from an operating loss of in fiscal  and down from an operating loss of in fiscal the fiscal results of the network communications segment were adversely affected by an excess inventory charge of to cost of sales for inventories estimated to be beyond its needs for the following months 
this write down was necessary in light of the downturn in the communications semiconductor industry 
in addition to the above market conditions  the network communications results were reduced by the company s continuing significant investment in research and development to develop and launch new products 
the impact of new products on revenue in the year of introduction is not normally significant 
however  management believes that new product introductions are critical to supporting future revenue growth 
during fiscal  the company continued to secure design wins and introduced new products to the market  up from new products introduced in fiscal and eight in fiscal consumer communications millions of us dollars revenue as a of total revenue operating income loss zarlink s consumer communications products allow users to connect to the network 
these products include wireless for example  cellular chipsets and infotainment applications for example  set top boxes and digital tv 
revenue for fiscal totaled  down from in fiscal and down from in fiscal the adverse business conditions described above for network communications also had a similar negative impact on the consumer communications business in fiscal the segment s operating loss increased to in fiscal from an operating loss of in fiscal and down from operating income of in fiscal the fiscal results were adversely affected by an excess inventory charge of to cost of sales for inventories estimated to be beyond its needs for the following months 
this write down resulted from the downturn in the communications semiconductor industry 
despite lower sales volumes and margins  the consumer communications segment continues to invest in research and development to expand its new product portfolio of wireless and set top box semiconductor solutions 
during fiscal  the company continued to secure design wins and introduced ten new products to the market  up from nine new products introduced in fiscal and six in fiscal ultra low power communications millions of us dollars revenue as a of total revenue operating income loss zarlink s ultra low power communications business provides asic and assp solutions for applications such as pacemakers  hearing aids  portable instruments and personal area communications devices 
fiscal ultra low power communications sales of were down from in fiscal and down from in fiscal due to higher customer inventories and reduced demand in the analog audiologic business 
the ultra low power communications operating results declined when compared with fiscal and fiscal results due to lower revenues combined with a weaker product mix which produced lower gross margins 
during fiscal  the ultra low power communications group introduced seven new products in addition to the seven new products introduced in fiscal and the two new products introduced in fiscal geographic revenue revenue from continuing operations  based on the geographic location of customers  was distributed as follows millions of us dollars of total of total of total asia pacific europe united states canada other regions total for the year ended march   the net movement in exchange rates from fiscal favorably impacted total revenue from continuing operations by 
for the year ended march   the net movement in exchange rates from fiscal favorably impacted total revenue from continuing operations by asia pacific asia pacific sales represented of the company s total sales in fiscal  and increased by compared to fiscal due to higher product sales within the network communications and consumer communications segments 
ultra low power communications sales in asia pacific decreased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal sales in the asia pacific region decreased by in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was due to lower demand for the company s network communications and consumer communications products 
europe european sales decreased by in fiscal from fiscal due to lower network communications and consumer communications product sales 
ultra low power communications sales in europe showed a minor increase over sales in fiscal fiscal sales into europe decreased by from fiscal due to lower sales of network communications and consumer communications products 
united states sales into the united states decreased by in fiscal from fiscal the decrease was due to lower product sales  predominantly in the consumer communications segment and also in the ultra low power communications segments 
sales decreased by in the united states in fiscal from fiscal the decrease was due to lower sales of network communications and consumer communications products 
canada canadian sales decreased by in fiscal from fiscal due to lower network communications sales in canada 
sales in canada increased from fiscal to fiscal by  mostly due to the inclusion of sales to mitel networks corporation  successor to the systems business that was sold on february  mitel networks corporation ceased its affiliation with zarlink on february  other regions sales into other regions increased by in fiscal compared with fiscal  and decreased by as compared to fiscal gross margin millions of us dollars gross margin as a of total revenue the company s gross margin as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended march   compared to in fiscal when the company recorded an inventory obsolescence charge of the gross margin improvements in fiscal compared to fiscal were attributable to lower overall manufacturing costs  and a favorable product mix in the network communications and consumer communications segments 
the fiscal gross margin was favorably impacted by one percentage point principally due to selling previously written down network communications inventory 
the improvement was partially offset by severance costs of related to cost reductions undertaken within the operations group 
the lower gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal was principally attributable to the excess inventory charge to cost of sales for inventories estimated to be beyond its needs for the following months 
margins were also lower due to the declining sales volumes of network communications and consumer communications products in fiscal and the associated negative manufacturing variances resulting from lower plant utilization 
operating expenses research and development r d millions of us dollars r d expenses as a of total revenue r d expenses increased by  or  in fiscal from fiscal  primarily due to new product development  increased headcount in certain r d projects to accelerate time to market initiatives and certain severance costs associated with project cancellations 
in fiscal  the company recorded r d severance costs of  which were mainly related to the company s decision in the third quarter of fiscal to cease product development in the vdsl very high rate digital subscriber line market in order to concentrate its r d resources on higher and more immediate growth opportunities 
management decided to cease its vdsl product development due to revised expectations of unacceptably long time to revenue and volume deployment 
fiscal r d decreased by  or  relative to fiscal r d due to restructuring and the consolidation of r d activities 
investments are being made in high growth areas such as network communications  consumer communications  and in ultra low power communications devices 
in the network communications product line  r d activities focused on the following areas o time division multiplex tdm switch development to set new industry standards in terms of channel density  levels of integration  feature sets and power density  o development of voice processing products for today s emerging carrier class gateways and voice over ip internet protocol networks for mobile telephony  addressing the problem of voice echo cancellation in the system 
new products will include zarlink technology to improve convergence time and voice quality thereby allowing the product to consume even less power and also enable better power consumption for voice transmitted through the mobile network  o planned development of higher speed phase lock loops pll for network timing synchronization 
these high speed plls will be used to provide the timing for transporting information over sonet sdh links that operate up to mbits s  o meeting convergence with tdm ip processing in packet processing  and ethernet switching for backplanes  linecard  edge metro and virtual private network vpn switches in packet switching  o utilization of its radio frequency rf expertise for timing  synthesizers  interface drivers  and amplifiers for its high performance analog product development  and o very short reach vsr parallel optical solutions targeted at terabit speeds and higher

selling and administrative s a millions of us dollars s a expenses as a of total revenue s a expenses decreased in fiscal by  or from fiscal  principally as a result of cost reductions implemented in fiscal in response to the industry downturn 
during fiscal  the company continued to implement cost reduction strategies within the sales and marketing organizations and various general administration functions across all geographic regions 
severance costs of were recorded in s a operating costs during fiscal in fiscal  s a expenses decreased by  or  from fiscal as a result of cost reductions implemented during that year in response to the industry downturn 
management expects that s a expenses will remain relatively flat in fiscal as compared to fiscal stock compensation expense the company records stock compensation expense or recovery arising from retention conditions associated with the stock awarded to certain employees of vertex networks  inc vertex  which was acquired in july  and from certain stock options subjected to option exchange programs 
the company recorded of stock compensation expense in fiscal due to the vesting of restricted stock awarded to certain employees of vertex as compared to expense of in fiscal and in fiscal no further stock compensation expense will be recorded against these formerly restricted shares 
during fiscal  the company recorded a net stock compensation recovery of  as compared to a stock compensation expense of in fiscal and in fiscal the compensation recovery in fiscal was the result of the decrease in market price of the underlying common stock in fiscal the reduced market price resulted in a recovery of previously recorded stock compensation expense on outstanding unvested options 
special charges special charge recorded in fiscal during fiscal  the company recorded a special charge of related to restructuring and certain asset impairments 
in response to the industry downturn  the company announced on may  that it had implemented a cost containment plan in order to preserve cash resources 
the cost containment plan included a workforce reduction of approximately of the company s total employee base or employees globally 
the workforce resizing was in addition to a workforce reduction that was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal accordingly  the company recorded a pre tax special charge of related to that program in the quarter ended june  the special charge was comprised of a workforce reduction charge of approximately primarily relating to the cost of severance and benefits for the termination of employees throughout the world in fiscal  and a charge of approximately relating to the cost of lease and contract settlements 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company took additional measures to reduce its operating costs by increasing its workforce reduction program and providing for excess office space 
prior to march   the company incurred additional severance and benefit costs of related to the termination of employees throughout the world 
in addition  the special charge in the fourth quarter included the cost of excess space in ottawa  canada of approximately the company also reviewed the carrying value of certain manufacturing assets in the year ended march  based on an analysis of estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from changes in the expected use of these fixed assets  the company determined that the carrying value of these fixed assets was impaired and recorded a write down of the company also recorded a write down of in the year ended march  related to the economic uncertainty of certain long term investments held at cost 
the fourth quarter special charge was net of a reversal of from the first quarter restructuring provision that was no longer required 
the reversal was due to savings on the workforce reduction program and to the subsequent sub letting of vacant space in irvine  california just after the close of fiscal special charge recorded in fiscal the company recorded an impairment charge  before taxes  of in the fourth quarter of fiscal in respect of certain capital assets 
the basis for the impairment charge is described below 
the industry slowdown was one of the key factors that led to a review of the company s carrying value of acquired intangible assets related to vertex 
management believed the unfavorable market conditions would continue  for the foreseeable future  to negatively affect the timing of expected future cash flows resulting from the acquired technology 
management believes the technology itself is sound and is a critical element in the company s focus on ip based products 
accordingly  the company reviewed the carrying value of the acquired intangible assets associated with vertex in the fourth quarter ended march  based on an analysis of undiscounted estimated future cash flows and current and expected adverse market conditions  the company determined that the carrying value of the acquired intangible assets was impaired 
accordingly  the company recorded a charge of in the fourth quarter of fiscal to write down the carrying value of the goodwill relating to vertex 
as at march   the carrying value of the acquired intangible assets related to vertex amounted to the balance was expensed in fiscal the company also reviewed the carrying value of its fabrication fab facilities in the fourth quarter of fiscal factors leading to the review for impairment included management s expectation that fab utilization would fall to less than  resulting in lower cash flows to recover the investment in the fabs 
the lowered expectation resulted from recent partnerships that were developed with outside fabs for new zarlink designs based on future technologies that are beyond existing capabilities at the company s fabs 
this review also considered the adverse market conditions  which resulted in a low operating rate for these facilities as well as the company s manufacturing strategy  described elsewhere in this annual report on form k  that is expected to incorporate higher degrees of outsourcing 
based on an analysis of undiscounted expected future cash flows reflecting these conditions  the company determined that the fabrication buildings and equipment were impaired and recorded a charge of  before income tax recoveries of  to write down these carrying values 
the tax recovery was separately included in the company s total income tax expense 
loss recovery on sale of busines on february   zarlink sold its foundry facility in bromont  quebec  and related business to dalsa semiconductor inc dalsa for under the agreement  zarlink received in cash from dalsa and retained a investment in the bromont foundry which was subsequently sold in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a loss on sale of the bromont foundry business of  before income tax recoveries of on march   the company sold its wafer fabrication facility in plymouth  uk  as well as certain intellectual property and related foundry businesses to companies controlled by x fab semiconductor foundries ag x fab of erfurt  germany for  represented by in cash on closing and a note of repayable over three years 
the gain on sale was deferred and netted against the carrying value of the note receivable 
the two companies also signed a three year agreement to ensure continuity of supply for zarlink products manufactured at bromont 
there is no minimum unit volume purchase requirement under the agreement 
approximately zarlink employees affiliated with the bromont operation were transferred to dalsa as part of the agreement 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a reversal of related to the reduction of certain provisions accrued at the time of the bromont and plymouth foundry sales in fiscal the excess provision was reversed as a result of a reduction in the remaining costs to separate the businesses and to settle claims 
amortization of acquired intangibles amortization of acquired intangibles decreased to nil in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the remaining acquired intangibles  including goodwill  resulting from the acquisition of vertex on july  were expensed in fiscal the fiscal expense was comprised of regular amortization of and an accelerated write down of associated with the impairment of other acquired intangibles to reduce the carrying value to nil as at march  the fiscal amortization of acquired intangibles was related to the acquisition of vertex in fiscal other income expense in fiscal  other expense was  as compared to income of in fiscal  and an expense of in fiscal other income expense was comprised of interest income  foreign exchange gains and losses  and other non operating gains and losses 
interest income was for the year ended march  as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the year over year decreases from fiscal to fiscal were due to lower average cash balances on hand and to lower interest rates 
foreign exchange losses in fiscal amounted to gain of  loss of 
gains and losses are realized on short term investments held in currencies other than the functional currency of the parent company  and according to month end foreign exchange rates 
during fiscal  there was a net decrease in earnings due to the foreign exchange revaluation of short term investments held in currencies other than the functional currency of the parent company 
other foreign exchange losses amounted to in fiscal the company sold its investment in dalsa in the third quarter of fiscal for cash proceeds of and recorded a gain on sale of during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and as a result of the company s assessment of financial information received in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and of ongoing challenges in the enterprise communications market  the company recorded an non cash write down of its investment in mitel networks corporation mitel 
reference is made to the company s policy on investments in private companies  included in critical accounting policies and significant estimates  located elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a charge of related to the settlement of the uk defined benefit pension plan 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company negotiated the settlement of a long term lease contract with a tenant at the company s sweden plant 
the company recorded a recovery of in the fourth quarter of fiscal in connection with the cash proceeds from the lease settlement 
during fiscal  the company recorded an equity loss from its investment in optenia  inc amounting to the equity loss in fiscal was  representing only one quarter of activity since the original investment in january there were no further equity losses recorded during fiscal as the investment in optenia  inc was written off to nil in the fourth quarter of fiscal after it went into bankruptcy 
interest expense interest expense was for fiscal  compared with and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
interest expense related primarily to capital leases 
income taxes income tax expense for fiscal was  compared with an income tax recovery of for fiscal and an expense of for fiscal the tax expense in fiscal was mainly comprised of canadian income and capital taxes 
the recovery in fiscal was principally due to the loss on sale of the cmos foundry in bromont  canada while the expense in fiscal was mostly attributable to taxable income in canada 
the company s effective tax rate was an expense of in fiscal this tax rate was lower than the domestic tax rate due to unrecorded temporary differences and losses incurred during the year 
in fiscal  zarlink s effective tax rate was a recovery of 
this tax rate was lower than the domestic tax rate primarily due to unrecorded temporary differences and losses incurred during fiscal in fiscal  zarlink s effective tax rate from continuing operations was an expense of 
this tax rate was lower than the domestic tax rate primarily due to the write down of non deductible goodwill and purchased in process research and development  and unrecorded losses and temporary differences in the company s foreign operations 
the company had a valuation allowance at the end of fiscal of fiscal  fiscal 
management has determined that sufficient uncertainties continue to exist regarding the realization of certain of its deferred tax assets and consequently a valuation allowance has been required to reduce the recorded value of these assets 
the increase in the allowance relates mainly to unrecorded investment tax credits and losses incurred in fiscal in the company s domestic and foreign jurisdictions  which were partially offset by the reversal of temporary differences in those same jurisdictions 
backlog millions of us dollars day backlog generally  manufacturing lead times for semiconductor products are longer because of the nature of the production process 
however  as orders are sometimes booked and shipped within the same fiscal quarter often referred to as turns  order backlog is not necessarily indicative of a sales outlook for a quarter or year 
the backlog has increased as a result of improved bookings in the network communications and ultra low power communications business segments when compared with fiscal levels 
discontinued operations communications systems business systems during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and on the second anniversary of the sale of the systems business  the company recorded a reversal of  related to the release of excess provisions related to the discontinued operations 
there were no discontinued operations included in the results of operations for the year ended march  on february   the company concluded the sale of the systems business to dr 
terence h 
matthews for net proceeds of  after adjustments 
as a result of this sale  the company recorded a net gain of  after transaction costs and income taxes in the year ended march  systems recorded revenue of during the period from april  to february   down from for the full year in fiscal the revenue decrease from the prior year was principally due to industry wide market softness while end customers delayed capital spending on systems and applications 
management believed industry announcements regarding new voice communications systems moving to an ip platform resulted in certain customers deferring capital spending in order to acquire the advanced functionality afforded by the new ip platforms in the future 
during the period up to the measurement date of november  the date the company adopted formal plans to pursue divestiture opportunities related to the systems business  the systems business had an operating loss  net of tax recoveries of  of  net of taxes of 
net loss the company recorded a net loss of  or per share in fiscal this compares to a net loss of  or per share  in fiscal in fiscal  net loss was  or per share 
the net loss in fiscal was mainly due to lower revenue  caused by the continued downturn in the semiconductor industry  and to non operating charges described and included in other expense 
the fiscal net loss resulted primarily from lower revenue due to the communications industry downturn  which in turn led to a charge for excess inventory of and special charges of the loss also included the loss on sale of the bromont foundry business  stock compensation expense of  and the impairment of the company s equity investment in optenia amounting to the net loss in fiscal resulted primarily from the charge for impairment of capital assets of  the amortization of acquired intangibles of and the expense of associated with early repayment of long term debt  partially offset by income  net of taxes  from discontinued operations amounting to liquidity and capital resources at march   cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash balances totaled  down from at march  cash and cash equivalents at march   included in the amount above  were cash flow used in operations before working capital changes was during fiscal compared to cash flow used in operations of during fiscal the decrease in cash flow used in operations during fiscal mainly resulted from improved operating earnings compared to fiscal since march   the company s working capital  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows  decreased by  mostly due to the reduction of inventories and prepaid expenses and improved cash collections from trade receivables 
this was offset by reductions of trade accounts payable and other accrued liabilities and on the settlement of certain pound sterling denominated hedge contracts 
management expects to further draw down inventory levels in fiscal by reducing cycle times and managing inventories on a build to order basis 
in comparison  the company s working capital decreased by during fiscal  mainly as a result of inventory reduction and improved cash collections from trade receivables 
this was offset by a reduction of trade accounts payable and other accrued liabilities  including payments in respect of exit activities 
cash used in investing activities was for the year ended march  compared to used during fiscal the net cash outflow from investing activities during fiscal primarily resulted from net purchases of short term investments totaling cash balances were also reduced by purchases of fixed and other assets totaling  offset by proceeds of from the disposal of certain fixed assets 
the fixed asset additions were primarily related to design tools and continuing improvements to information technology resources 
capital expenditures declined significantly in fiscal when compared with fiscal management expects capital spending to decrease further in fiscal a net reduction of long term investments of in fiscal resulted from cash proceeds of received during the third quarter as a result of the sale of the company s minority investment in dalsa  offset by a small investment purchased earlier in the year 
the cash outflow from investing activities during fiscal was primarily the result of net purchases of short term investments in the amount of cash payments of were offset by sale proceeds of for fixed and other assets 
fixed asset additions were primarily related to the construction of  and leasehold improvements to  the company s new head office in ottawa  canada  continuing improvements to information technology resources  and design tools 
cash inflows were primarily a result of the sale of the corporate headquarters and both of its cmos fabrication facilities in fiscal a cash inflow of from the repayment of a note receivable and net proceeds of from the sale of discontinued operations were offset by a increase in long term investments in fiscal cash used in financing activities during fiscal totaled the cash outflow was primarily the result of an payment to settle the company s defined benefit pension plan in the united kingdom 
during fiscal  the company also hypothecated of cash and cash equivalents under its revolving global credit facility to cover outstanding letters of credit  described below 
the repayment of capital lease liabilities in the amount of  the repurchase of of the company s redeemable preferred shares  and the payment of for dividends on the preferred shares also negatively impacted cash flows 
these cash outflows were offset by received from the issuance of new common shares upon the exercise of stock options 
during fiscal  cash flows used in financing activities totaled  primarily as a result of the repayment of long term debt and capital lease liabilities 
repurchases of the company s redeemable preferred shares and the payment of dividends on the preferred shares also negatively impacted cash flows 
this was offset by the receipt of for the issuance of common shares upon the exercise of stock options 
on june   the company announced its board of directors had authorized the continuation of its normal course issuer bid program to repurchase and cancel up to  common shares  representing of the  common shares issued and outstanding at may  the purchases would take place on the open market through the stock exchanges of new york and toronto over a twelve month period beginning on june  and ending on june   or on such earlier date as the company may have completed its purchases pursuant to the notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid filed with the toronto stock exchange 
no common shares were repurchased under the renewed program for the year period ended june   nor under the previous program during the period from june  to june  the program expired on june  and was not renewed by the company 
in addition to cash  cash equivalents  short term investment and restricted cash balances totaling as at march   the company had a revolving global credit facility of approximately cdn  of which in letters of credit were outstanding 
accordingly  the company had unused and available demand bank lines of credit of as at march  as a result of the non cash write down of the mitel investment in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company did not meet a quarterly financial covenant under the company s credit facility 
a waiver was obtained from the bank in respect of the financial covenant 
the credit facility is subject to periodic review  including the determination of financial covenants 
it is uncertain if the company will be able to meet these financial covenants in the future and  if not  to obtain a waiver from the bank  which may result in the availability of the credit facility being reduced or restricted 
management does not anticipate that this would have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company 
management believes the company is in a position to meet all foreseeable business cash requirements and capital lease and preferred share payments from its cash balance on hand including cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash  existing financing facilities and cash flow from operations 
commitments and guarantees performance guarantees performance guarantees are contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on another entity s failure to perform under an obligating agreement 
the company has an outstanding performance guarantee related to a managed services agreement project agreement undertaken by the discontinued systems business  which was sold to companies controlled by dr 
terence h 
matthews on february  and now operated as mitel networks corporation 
this performance guarantee remained with the company following the sale of the systems business to dr 
matthews 
the project agreement and the company s performance guarantee extend until july  the terms of the project agreement continue to be fulfilled by mitel 
the maximum potential amount of future undiscounted payments the company could be required to make under the guarantee  at march   was british pounds  assuming the company is unable to secure the completion of the project 
the company is not aware of any factors as at march  that would prevent the project s completion under the terms of the agreement 
in the event that mitel is unable to fulfill the commitments of the project agreement  the company believes that an alternate third party contractor could be secured to complete the agreement requirements 
at march   the carrying value of these guarantees was nil 
the company periodically has entered into agreements with customers and suppliers that include limited intellectual property indemnifications that are customary in the industry 
these guarantees generally require the company to compensate the other party for certain damages and costs incurred as a result of third party intellectual property claims arising from these transactions 
the nature of the intellectual property indemnification obligations prevents the company from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount it could be required to pay to its customers and suppliers 
historically  the company has not made any significant indemnification payments under such agreements and no amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification obligations 
in connection with the sale of the systems business described in note  the company provided to the purchaser certain income tax indemnities with an indefinite life and with no maximum liability for the taxation periods up to february   the closing date of the sale 
as at march   the taxation years to february  are subject to audit by taxation authorities 
as at march   the company has guaranteed a custom bond amounting to to a third party on behalf of a subsidiary 
supply agreements the company has wafer supply agreements with three independent foundries  which expire from to under these agreements  the suppliers are obligated to provide certain quantities of wafers per year 
none of the agreements have minimum unit volume purchase requirements 
other critical accounting policies and significant estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
management believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that currently affect zarlink s financial condition and results of operations 
in general  any changes in estimates or assumptions relating to revenue recognition and provisions for inventory are directly reflected in the results of our reportable operating segments 
changes in estimates or assumptions pertaining to provisions for restructuring or income tax asset valuations are not reflected in our reportable operating segments  but are reflected on a consolidated basis 
management has discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and with the full board of directors 
this review is conducted annually 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
the company s semiconductor products are primarily non commodity  specialized products that are proprietary in design and used by multiple customers 
customer acceptance provisions for performance requirements are generally based on seller specified criteria  which we demonstrate prior to shipment 
should management determine that these customer acceptance provisions are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for future reporting periods could be affected 
inventory the company periodically compares its inventory levels to revenue forecasts for the future twelve months on a part by part basis and records a charge for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated twelve month demand 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company s inventory of network communications and consumer communications products exceeded the estimated month demand by as a result of the industry downturn to result in a charge of the same amount 
if future demand for the company s products continues to decline  an additional write down of inventory may be necessary 
restructuring beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company began accounting for restructuring activities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  which requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under the company s previous accounting policy  which was in accordance with eitf  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas concludes that an entity s commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create a present obligation to others that meets the definition of a liability 
therefore  sfas eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in eitf the new pronouncement also establishes that fair value should be used for initial measurement of the liability 
implementation of sfas had no impact on the company s financial statements for fiscal but will impact the accounting treatment of future exit or disposal activities should they occur 
during fiscal  zarlink continued to reduce its workforce across all geographic regions and withdrew from the vdsl market in order to concentrate its r d resources on higher and more immediate growth opportunities 
as a result  the company incurred and paid severance costs 
all severance costs related to fiscal vdsl restructuring activities were accrued and paid by march  during fiscal  the company recorded significant reserves in connection with a restructuring program 
these reserves included estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and the settlements of contractual obligations resulting from our actions 
although management does not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from these estimates 
income taxes zarlink has incurred losses and other costs that can be applied against future taxable earnings to reduce the tax liability on those earnings 
as management is uncertain of realizing the future benefit of those losses and expenditures  the company has taken a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets and recorded only deferred tax assets that can be applied against income in currently taxable jurisdictions or applied against deferred tax liabilities that will reverse in the future 
in establishing the appropriate valuation allowance for tax loss carry forwards and temporary differences  it is necessary to consider all available evidence  both positive and negative 
historical information of profitability is supplemented by current information that is available about future years 
changes in the business environment and available information in the future may require the valuation allowance to be adjusted to account for the revised uncertainties  and such adjustment may be material 
investment in private companies management periodically reviews the company s investment to determine if there has been other than a temporary decline in the market value of this investment below the carrying value 
management s assessment of impairment in carrying value is based on the market value trends of similar public companies and the current business performance of those investments 
as at march   the company had an investment in mitel  a canadian corporation that files annual and other reports with the united states securities and exchange commission under the securities and exchange act of as a result of the company s assessment of financial information received in the fourth quarter of fiscal and of ongoing challenges in the enterprise communications market  the investment in mitel was written down to a nil value in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as the company believes that the carrying value will not be realized in the foreseeable future 
foreign currency translation management periodically evaluates the financial and operational independence of its foreign operations 
should a foreign subsidiary s local currency cease to be its functional currency  then translation gains or losses on consolidating the foreign subsidiary s financial statements subsequent to the change in functional currency would be charged to operating income instead of a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
effective march   the beginning of fiscal  as a result of the company s increased economic activities denominated in us dollars  the us dollar has become the functional currency across the company s operations

those changes will result in more consistent reporting of contracts that are derivatives in their entirety or that contain embedded derivatives that warrant separate accounting 
this statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   except as stated below and for hedging relationships designated after june  the guidance will be applied prospectively 
the provisions of this statement that relate to statement implementation issues that have been effective for fiscal quarters that began prior to june   will continue to be applied in accordance with their respective effective dates

forward looking statements certain statements in this management s discussion and analysis constitute forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of zarlink  or industry results  to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such risks  uncertainties and assumptions include the following general economic and business conditions  increasing price and product service competition by foreign and domestic competitors  including new entrants  demographic changes  import protection and regulation  rapid technological developments and changes  the ability to continue to introduce competitive new products on a timely  cost effective basis  delays in product development  changes in environmental and other domestic and foreign governmental regulations  the mix of products services  protection and validity of patent and other intellectual property rights  industry competition  industry capacity and other industry trends  the ability of zarlink to attract and retain key employees and other factors referenced elsewhere in this form k 
the above factors are representative of the risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome of the forward looking statements 
in addition  such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates  general domestic and international economic conditions including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations and other risks  uncertainties and assumptions  as described elsewhere in this form k  including those identified under forward looking statements and risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial statements of the company due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
zarlink is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
to manage these risks  the company uses certain derivative financial instruments including foreign exchange forward contracts and other derivative instruments from time to time  which have been authorized pursuant to board approved policies and procedures 
zarlink does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company uses forward contracts  and to a lesser extent foreign currency options  to reduce the exposure to foreign exchange risk 
the most significant foreign exchange exposures for the company  after the change to the us dollar as the functional currency in fiscal  relate to the canadian dollar and the uk pound sterling 
at march   there were unrealized losses of on the forward contracts relating to fiscal the unrealized loss is calculated as the difference between the actual contract rates and the applicable current market rates that would be used to terminate the forward contracts on march   if it became necessary to unwind these contracts 
additional potential gains in the net fair value of these contracts  assuming a appreciation in the us dollar against all currencies  at march   would have been approximately conversely  a depreciation in the dollar against all currencies would have produced a loss of management believes that the established hedges are effective against its known and anticipated cash flows  and that potential future losses from these hedges being marked to market would be largely offset by gains on the underlying hedged transactions 
for fiscal  the company s primary exposure to interest rates is expected to be in the rollover of its short term investment portfolio 
in accordance with company policy  cash equivalent and short term investment balances are primarily comprised of high grade money market instruments with original maturity dates of less than one year 
the company does not hedge the re investment risk on its short term investments 
based on a sensitivity analysis performed on the financial instruments held at march  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  the impact to the fair value of our cash equivalents and short term investments portfolio by an immediate hypothetical parallel shift in the yield curve of plus or minus  or basis points would result in a decline or increase in portfolio value of approximately nil  and respectively 
the estimated potential losses discussed previously assume the occurrence of certain adverse market conditions 
they do not consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors and do not represent projected losses in fair value that the company expects to incur 
any future financial impact would be based on actual developments in global financial markets 
management does not foresee any significant changes in the strategies used to manage interest and foreign exchange rate risks in the near future
