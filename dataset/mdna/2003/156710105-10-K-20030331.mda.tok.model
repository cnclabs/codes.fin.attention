item business introduction ceradyne  inc ceradyne or the company develops  manufactures and markets advanced technical ceramic products and components for industrial  defense  consumer  microwave communications and automotive applications 
in many high performance applications  products made of advanced technical ceramics meet specifications that similar products made of metals or plastics cannot achieve 
advanced technical ceramics can withstand extremely high temperatures  combine hardness with light weight  are highly resistant to corrosion and wear  and have excellent electrical insulation capability and other special electronic properties 
ceradyne s technology was originally developed primarily for defense and aerospace applications which have historically represented a substantial portion of its business 
however  the company has diversified its product lines based on the development of new ceramic materials applications for domestic and international markets 
the company continues to serve its historical customer base which accounts for a substantial portion of ceradyne s business 
the company derives a portion of its revenues from its traditional products  lightweight ceramic armor for military helicopters and microwave tube products 
however  newer products developed or being developed by the company for defense  industrial and consumer applications represent an increasing share of its business 
examples of these newer products include i lightweight ceramic armor vests for military personnel  ii a translucent ceramic orthodontic bracket  which is sold to unitek corporation  a subsidiary of m  under an exclusive marketing agreement and marketed by unitek under its brand name clarity  iii silicon nitride advanced technical ceramic components cam rollers used in diesel engines  iv wear resistant components for industrial machinery  such as paper making equipment  made from the company s ceralloy silicon nitride advanced technical ceramic  v missile nose cones or radomes for the defense industry  vi large corrosion resistant ceramic components sold to semiconductor equipment manufacturers and vii supplying lightweight ceramic armor systems components which will be incorporated into the ford lincoln town car ballistic protection series bps 
industry background developments in industrial processing  military systems  microwave electronics  consumer electronics  automotive diesel engine products  and orthodontics have generated a demand for high performance materials with certain properties not readily available in metals or plastics 
in certain high performance applications  this demand has been met by products made of advanced technical ceramics 
the following table compares certain favorable properties of selected advanced technical ceramics commonly used by the company with those of other selected materials 
materials melting point degrees fahrenheit hardness vickers scale chemical resistance to acids electrical properties density gms per cc advanced technical ceramics  to   to  excellent from conductors to excellent insulators to high strength alloy steel  to  to fair conductors to high performance plastics to to good to excellent good to excellent insulators to ceramics such as earthenware  glass  brick and tile have been made for centuries and are still in common use today 
the inertness and lasting qualities of ceramics are illustrated by the artifacts uncovered intact in modern times 
almost all traditional ceramics  including those of ancient times  were based on clay 
in recent years  significant advances have been made in ceramic technology through the application of specialized processes to produce man made ceramic powders 
in the s and s  developments in aluminum oxide and other oxides provided ceramics that were excellent electrical insulators and were capable of withstanding high temperatures 
in the s  these and other developments resulted in the ability to manufacture advanced technical ceramics with great strength at elevated temperatures and reduced brittleness  historically a primary limitation of ceramics 
the products that have emerged from these advances are known as advanced technical or structural ceramics 
the properties of advanced technical ceramics present a compelling case for their use in a wide array of applications 
however  manufacturing costs associated with the production of these materials need to be reduced in order to accelerate the use of advanced technical ceramics as a direct replacement for metals  plastics or other ceramics 
a portion of these costs is related to the need for diamond grinding finished components to exacting tolerances 
industry cost reduction efforts have included the production of blanks or feed stock to near net shape configurations  thus reducing the need for final finishing 
manufacturers are also seeking to reduce costs through the use of high volume automated processing and finishing equipment and techniques  and to achieve economies of scale in areas such as powder processing  blank fabrication  firing  finishing and inspection 
ceradyne strategy the company s strategy is to capitalize on its existing technologies  developed originally for defense and aerospace applications  and to broaden its product and customer base through increased marketing efforts  both domestically and internationally 
the company is focusing on additional customer requirements for existing products  and on emerging markets and products which require or can benefit from the physical  chemical or electronic properties of advanced technical ceramics 
to support this strategy  the company s advanced ceramic operations in costa mesa  california created a new research development department in early to focus on new materials technology 
ceradyne seeks to increase sales of its traditional products primarily through expanded domestic and global marketing efforts 
in  ceradyne established a european sales office in england and in early an asian sales office in beijing  china 
the european office will concentrate its sales efforts in the area of industrial applications and lightweight ceramic armor for military applications 
the china office will concentrate its sales efforts in the area of industrial ceramics  utilizing fused silica ceramics for the glass tempering and metal forming markets 
approximately of the company s sales and production originate at its west coast facility in costa mesa  california 
the company is seeking to reduce its operating and production costs including energy  logistics  occupancy and other costs incurred in california by establishing a manufacturing center and relocating some of its california production operations to an area in the united states that is less expensive 
the company is presently investigating a relocation strategy that would enable it to effectively move some of its operations out of california 
the company is attempting to reduce its production costs and levels of work in process and finished goods inventory by implementing and employing demand flow technology dft 
dft is a scalable  mathematically based business strategy  specifically designed to allow manufacturers to respond faster and more efficiently to the needs of their customers and the marketplace 
its primary purpose is to increase the flow of goods in a manufacturing environment to lower costs and gain efficiencies 
in addition to the company s strategy to leverage its existing technologies  the company expects much of its future growth to come from products which are currently in early production or still in development 
there can be no assurances  however  that products still under development will be successfully completed  or that any of these newer products  including those already in production  will achieve wide market acceptance 
see risk factors 
the following table illustrates these newer and planned products and the markets for which they are intended 
market opportunity technical demands of market ceradyne s strategic response industrial corrosion resistant non oxide ceramics for use as semiconductor equipment chamber components that handle wafers

ceradyne s r d group is continually working with semiconductor equipment suppliers to tailor ceradyne s ceramic materials to meet new equipment requirements 
wear resistant components required on the rubbing or cutting surfaces of industrial machinery  such as in paper making equipment  centrifuges  and cutting tool inserts 
failure of industrial equipment is often caused by premature wearing out of surfaces due to abrasive action 
examples include paper making where the pulp slurry runs at feet per minute  or in metal cutting where as much as 
inch depth of cut are removed in a single pass 
ceralloy sintered reaction bonded silicon nitride srbsn industrial wear parts and cutting tool inserts are designed to replace hard metal or even oxide ceramic wear surfaces  resulting in great productivity  quality and longer uptime 
defense lightweight armor for military personnel 
as tactical conflicts as well as terrorist and other activities result in the increased use of automatic weapons  it has become necessary to stop bullets as great as a 
caliber machine gun round 
however  vests or other armor must be light enough in weight to allow freedom of movement without undue fatigue 
ceradyne has developed imp act improved multihit protection advanced composite technology to improve the performance of ceralloy boron carbide in body armor and other military applications 
further research is focused on flexible armor solutions utilizing ceralloy silicon carbide and ceralloy silicon nitride 
missile nose cones radomes 
next generation defensive missiles standard missile block iv and block iva and patriot pac will be required to fly at extremely high velocities  tight turning radii  and severe weather conditions 
these operating conditions may preclude the use of conventional polymer materials 
the company s advanced technical ceramic radomes are designed to address demanding specifications of next generation missile nose cones 
lightweight appliqu armor for ground combat vehicles 
the increased necessity for worldwide military police actions and rapid response peacekeeping missions is driving the military vehicle force to lightweight systems that are air transportable 
these vehicles must provide armor protection beyond their original design specification  which can only be met through the addition of lightweight modular armor appliqu 
new armor development initiatives at ceradyne are focused on a low cost  durable modular armor kit technology called ramtech that can be added to many different vehicles 
multi hit protection is provided against mm  mm and mm armor piercing ammunition 
consumer orthodontic brackets traditional stainless steel orthodontic ceramic brackets are often considered unsightly 
substitute clear plastic materials can be weak and may stain 
some orthodontic patients prefer aesthetically pleasing brackets which can be affixed to each tooth to support the archwire 
ceradyne s transtar translucent orthodontic brackets are inert  pick up the color of the patient s teeth and allow the orthodontist to correct the patient s bite 
the company and its marketing partner  m unitek  introduced an enhanced version of this ceramic bracket in  which is marketed by unitek under the brand name clarity 
automotive heavy duty diesel engine valve train components and high pressure fuel pump components 
in order to achieve diesel engine life of one million miles and automobile engine life of over  miles without major maintenance  it may be necessary to replace metal engine components with longer lasting  lighter weight  higher temperature resistant ceramic parts at acceptable unit costs 
ceradyne s ceralloy srbsn is a candidate for a variety of engine components including cam rollers  fuel pump parts and other wear components 
the company is in production of cam rollers for diesel engines and rollers for fuel pumps 
ceradyne continues prototype development with a number of engine and fuel systems manufacturers worldwide to expand the application of its cam roller products 
as part of the company s strategy  management has and intends to further establish additional sales representative and distributor relationships  particularly in international markets 
the company will also seek to develop strategic product development or marketing relationships with other manufacturing companies or key customers whose expertise  marketing or financial resources will assist the company in accomplishing these objectives 
see risk factors 
strategic relationships the company has established two strategic relationships which have been  and the company expects will continue to be  important factors in the company s efforts to develop and expand its advanced technical ceramic technology into new products and markets 
these relationships are described below 
ford motor company joint development program 
ceradyne completed a series of transactions with the ford motor company ford in march with a long term objective of developing ceramic components for automobiles 
key to this venture was the transfer of technology developed by ford relating to technical ceramics  including a portfolio of united states and corresponding foreign patents and patent applications  and the investment by ford of million in the company in exchange for common stock which eventually resulted in an ownership interest in ceradyne of approximately 
ford and the company also entered into a joint development program pursuant to which ceradyne has been applying its experience and expertise in technical ceramics to develop this technology into commercial products with a view to eventually develop components for automobile engines 
the technology acquired from ford and the efforts of this joint development program have led to the development of ceradyne s ceralloy sintered reaction bonded silicon nitride srbsn advanced technical ceramic  from which the company now produces a line of industrial wear components and has a line of components for use in diesel engines and fuel pumps 
in january  ford sold its entire remaining ownership interest in ceradyne of  shares to mutual funds and private investment funds associated with needham company  inc the company continues to maintain a good relationship with ford and has been selected by ford to supply lightweight ceramic armor system components which will be incorporated into the lincoln town car ballistic protection series 
m unitek orthodontic bracket joint program 
in march  ceradyne entered into a joint development and supply agreement with unitek corporation  a subsidiary of minnesota mining and mfg m unitek for the development of a translucent ceramic bracket for orthodontic appliances commonly known as braces 
under this agreement  m unitek  which is a major manufacturer of stainless steel orthodontic brackets  provided ceradyne with information regarding the functional specifications and properties which ceramic brackets would be required to satisfy 
based on this information and utilizing its experience with translucent ceramics originally produced by ceradyne for defense electronic countermeasure applications  ceradyne developed  and in began manufacturing  translucent ceramic brackets 
these brackets cosmetically blend with the natural color of the patient s teeth while performing the structural functions formerly performed by traditional stainless steel brackets 
ceradyne and m unitek have obtained and jointly own two united states patents covering the basic use of translucent ceramics for an orthodontic bracket 
m unitek has an exclusive right to market brackets based on this technology until market applications the company s products can be categorized by the table below which represents principal market applications they address in percent of total sales 
year ended december  industrial defense consumer microwave tube products automotive total set forth below is a description of the company s principal products itemized by market industrial industrial wear components 
ceradyne s industrial wear components are made primarily of its ceralloy sintered reaction bonded silicon nitride srbsn 
these srbsn ceramic components are generally incorporated in industrial machinery where severe abrasive conditions exist which wear out vital components 
the ceradyne wear resistant parts are used to replace conventional wear materials such as tungsten carbide or ceramics such as alumina or zirconia 
often these parts are incorporated in high wear areas at the original equipment manufacturer s plant 
applications include metal cutting tool inserts  paper making equipment  abrasive blasting nozzles as well as custom applications 
semiconductor equipment components 
the equipment used to make semiconductor wafers is extremely advanced and the newest generation has operating environments that are harsh enough to limit the life of the traditional ceramic and metal components 
ceradyne offers the industry non oxide ceramics that have exceptional corrosion resistance and other key properties  such as high thermal conductivity  that are essential to the manufacture of high quality semiconductor wafers 
tempered glass furnace components and metallurgical and industrial tooling 
fused silica ceramic is a ceramic which does not materially expand when heated  nor materially contract when cooled 
it is used to produce industrial tooling components and molds where complicated shapes and dimensions must be maintained over a wide range of temperatures 
such applications include the forming and shaping of titanium metal  used in the manufacturing of aircraft 
other applications take advantage of fused silica s excellent thermal shock resistance and inertness when in contact with glass 
these include components for equipment used in the fabrication of flat plate and tempered glass  such as tempering furnace rollers  and contoured shapes such as automobile windshields and architectural glass 
fused silica ceramic shapes of up to feet in length are produced in the company s facility located near atlanta  georgia 
defense lightweight ceramic armor 
ceradyne has developed and currently produces lightweight ceramic armor capable of protecting against threats as great as mm armor piercing machine gun bullets 
compared to traditional steel armor plates  ceradyne s ceramic armor systems offer weight savings as great as for mm  mm and mm armor piercing projectiles 
utilizing hot pressed ceralloy ceramic  the company s armor plates are laminated with either kevlar tm  spectra tm  fiberglass  zylon or custom hybrid laminates and formed into a wide variety of shapes  structures and components 
historically  ceramic armor manufactured by the company has been used principally for military helicopter crew seats and airframe panels 
the company believes it is a leader in producing lightweight ceramic armor for military helicopters 
recently  ceradyne has become a major supplier of lightweight ceramic body armor for the us army  and is rapidly expanding in new areas that require protection  including ground combat vehicles  marine craft and architectural infrastructure 
see risk factors we must successfully increase manufacturing capacity and improve product yields or our gross margins and profitability may suffer 
the company received its first production contract for ceramic armor vests for military personnel in january this order  from the defense logistics agency of the united states government  was for million in vests  which the company shipped during on march   a us government agency selected ceradyne to provide certain ceramic armor products over a multi year period 
the multi year contract provides for total orders over the year life of the program which could exceed million 
the company was notified in september that the contract would be extended for at least two more years into through december   the company has received production orders under this program totaling million 
however  there can be no assurances as to the exact quantities or deliveries under this program as the government is not required to purchase any minimum amount and all orders are at the full discretion of the government 
additionally  in  ceradyne received further new firm orders for body armor products under two new contracts worth approximately million  all of which are scheduled to ship during the first seven months of missile nose cones radomes 
the company produces conical shaped  precision machined ceramic components which are designed for the front end of defensive missiles 
these nose cones  or radomes  are used where the velocities and operating environments are severe and the thermal shock and erosion resistance  high strength and microwave transparency properties of advanced technical ceramics are required 
radomes manufactured by the company have been qualified for the standard missile block iv and block iva missile program and for the patriot pac missile program 
the pac missile is now in the low rate production phase 
consumer ceramic orthodontic brackets 
in the orthodontic process of correcting a patient s tooth alignment  typically small about stainless steel brackets are adhered to each individual tooth in order to serve as a guide to the archwire which is the wire that sets into each bracket 
the cosmetic appearance of all this metal is often considered quite unattractive 
ceradyne  together with its marketing partner  m unitek  have developed and are marketing ceramic orthodontic brackets made of ceradyne s translucent ceramic  transtar 
the translucency of this ceramic bracket  together with the classic ceramic properties of hardness  chemical inertness and imperviousness  have resulted in a cosmetic substitute for traditional stainless steel brackets 
these products are generally sold as aesthetic alternatives to conventional metal brackets and have been in production since ceradyne and m unitek introduced a new enhanced ceramic bracket called clarity in october of this product has patent protection and offers new features which improve the bracket s strength and functionality  compared to earlier designs manufactured by the company 
comments from orthodontists who have purchased clarity brackets have been positive 
the company believes clarity brackets offer the orthodontist a more robust product that will minimize treatment and chair time while providing superior aesthetic appearance 
microwave tube products microwave ceramic impregnated dispenser cathodes 
the company manufactures ceramic impregnated dispenser cathodes which are used in microwave tubes for applications in radar  satellite communications  electronic countermeasures and other uses 
dispenser cathodes  when heated  provide the stream of electrons which are magnetically focused into an electron beam 
microwave frequency signals which interact with this beam of electrons are substantially increased in power 
microwave dispenser cathodes are primarily composed of a porous tungsten matrix impregnated with ceramic oxide compounds 
samarium cobalt permanent magnets 
the company s samarium cobalt magnets are sold as components primarily for microwave tube applications 
electron beams in microwave tubes generated by the dispenser cathodes described above can be controlled by the magnetic force provided by these powerful permanent magnets 
the magnets are generally small sub components of microwave traveling wave tubes 
precision ceramics 
ceradyne produces a wide variety of hot pressed ceralloy ceramic compositions  precision diamond ground to close tolerances  primarily for microwave tube applications 
the interior cavities of microwave tubes often require ceramic components capable of operating at elevated temperatures and in high vacuums 
automotive market internal combustion and diesel engine components 
the demand for higher performance  cleaner burning  more efficient and more durable engines for heavy duty diesel trucks and automobiles creates additional opportunities for advanced technical ceramics 
the company believes that if engines could be produced using certain advanced technical ceramic components  they could be lighter and last longer than those using metal components  and could operate at higher temperatures and pressures with reduced cooling and lubrication requirements 
as a result  engines would use less fuel  achieve more complete combustion thereby reducing emissions  and be less costly to maintain 
because of these potential benefits  industry wide efforts are being made to replace selected metal components in heavy duty diesel engines and fuel pumps with advanced technical ceramic components 
ceradyne has produced a number of prototype parts made from ceradyne s ceralloy silicon nitride for evaluation and testing in internal combustion and diesel engines 
ceradyne has been producing cam rollers for heavy duty diesel engines since  and now has sole source contracts with two major engine companies 
ceradyne also has a sole source contract with a fuel systems manufacturer for components for a light duty diesel fuel pump 
in addition  ceradyne has development projects in place with a number of engine and fuel systems manufacturers world wide for various ceramic components 
furthermore  ceradyne is engaged in a joint development program with ford to develop ceramic components for automobile engines 
ford is not obligated to purchase any minimum quantities of components developed under this program and ceradyne s efforts in this area are still in the experimental stage with future success greatly dependent on achieving cost reductions while maintaining a high quality level 
ceramic armor system components for ford motor company 
the demand for ballistic protection vehicles has been growing due to ever increasing geopolitical threats 
the company has been selected by ford motor company to supply lightweight ceramic armor systems components which will be incorporated into the lincoln town car ballistic protection series bps 
the components supplied by ceradyne will incorporate technology and ballistic protection similar to that developed by the company for several defense related applications 
the introduction of this car culminates two years of working with a ford assembled team of experts in ballistic steel  ballistic grade windows and run flat tires 
ford is the only domestic original equipment manufacturer oem of armored vehicles  and the lincoln town car bps is the only armored automobile that provides protection from powerful handgun and high power rifle rounds compared to only hand gun level protection offered by others 
marketing and customers each of ceradyne s three manufacturing locations maintains an autonomous sales and marketing force promoting their individual products 
the company has more than employees directly involved in sales and marketing  including a marketing manager located in the united kingdom who was hired in february   and a sales manager located in beijing  china  who was hired in january the company also has agreements with manufacturers representatives in the united states and other countries who are compensated as a percent of sales in their territory 
ceradyne is focusing much of its marketing effort outside the united states through direct involvement of senior management personnel from the company s us facilities in concert with local manufacturing representatives 
revenues from export sales represented approximately in  in and in generally  the company sells components to contractors or original equipment manufacturers 
to a lesser extent  ceradyne sells its products directly to the end user 
the company sells its translucent ceramic orthodontic brackets only to m unitek pursuant to an exclusive marketing agreement with that customer 
sales to m unitek represented approximately of total net sales in  in  and in see risk factors sales of our ceramic orthodontic brackets depend on our exclusive marketing and sales relationship with unitek  a division of m corporation 
the company continues to explore various domestic and international marketing  and other relationships to increase its sales and market penetration 
furthermore  ceradyne is attempting to create long term relationships with its customers to promote a smoother  more predictable flow of orders and shipments by entering into multi year agreements or exclusive relationships where possible 
manufacturing processes ceradyne has a number of manufacturing processes which are dedicated to specific products and markets 
these processes and the product applications are described below 
hot pressing 
the company s hot pressing process is generally used to fabricate ceramic shapes for lightweight ceramic armor and semiconductor equipment components 
ceradyne has developed and constructed induction heated furnaces capable of operating at temperatures exceeding f in inert atmospheres at pressures up to lbs 
per square inch 
this equipment enables ceradyne to fabricate parts more than inches in diameter  which is considered large for advanced technical ceramics 
through the use of multiple cavity dies and special tooling  the company can produce a number of parts in one furnace during a single heating and pressing cycle 
ceradyne procures its raw materials fine powders from several outside suppliers 
after processing by the company  the powders are either loaded directly into the hot pressing molds or are shaped into pre forms prior to loading into the hot pressing molds 
the powders are placed in specially prepared graphite tooling  most of which is produced by ceradyne 
heat and pressure are gradually applied to the desired level  carefully maintained and finally reduced 
the furnace is removed from the press while cooling to permit the press to be used with another furnace 
for most products  approximately hours are required to perform this cycle 
the resultant ceramic product generally has mechanical  chemical and electrical properties of a quality approaching that only theoretically obtainable 
almost all products are then finished by diamond grinding to meet precise dimensional specifications 
sintering of fused silica ceramics 
sintering of fused silica ceramics is the process ceradyne uses to fabricate fused silica ceramic shapes for applications in glass tempering furnaces  metallurgical tooling and other industrial uses 
to fabricate fused silica ceramic shapes  fused silica powders are made into unfired shapes through slip casting or other ceramic compaction processes 
these unfired green shapes are fired as they move through a continuously operated foot long tunnel kiln at temperatures up to f 
the final shapes are often marketed in the as fired condition or  in some cases  precision diamond ground to achieve specific dimensional tolerances or surface finishes required by certain customers 
see business  manufacturing processes diamond grinding 
ceramic impregnated dispenser cathode fabrication 
ceramic impregnated dispenser cathode fabrication is used to produce cathodes for microwave power tube applications 
to produce ceramic impregnated dispenser cathodes  both tungsten metal powders and ceramic powders are used 
the tungsten metal powders are isostatically pressed in polymer tooling  removed and fired in special atmospheres at temperatures in excess of f 
the tungsten billets are machined into precision shapes with exacting tolerances 
the tungsten machined shapes are impregnated with a ceramic composite and fired at high temperatures in special atmospheres 
the ceramic impregnated components are assembled and furnace brazed 
final processing includes the insertion of a metal heating element within a ceramic insulating compound and the addition of an extremely thin layer of precious metals to the surface 
the company s final quality inspection often includes a test of the cathode s electron emitting capabilities at normal operating temperatures 
sintering and reaction bonding of silicon nitride 
the sintering of reaction bonding silicon nitride results in the company s ceralloy srbsn  which is used in industrial and automotive applications 
ceradyne s srbsn is based on technology acquired from ford 
see strategic relationships 
this srbsn process begins with relatively inexpensive high purity elemental silicon si powders  which contrasts sharply with most other competitors manufacturing techniques which start with relatively more expensive silicon nitride sin powders 
after additives are incorporated by milling and spray drying  the silicon powders are formed into shapes through conventional ceramic processing such as dry pressing 
these shapes are then fired in a nitrogen atmosphere which converts the silicon part to a silicon nitride part 
at this step reaction bonding  the silicon nitride is pressure sintered in an inert atmosphere increasing the strength of the component threefold 
as a result of srbsn processing  the ceramic crystals grow in an intertwining needle like fashion which the company has named needlelok tm 
ceradyne s needlelok tm structure results in a tough  high fracture energy part 
the process is economical due to the low cost of the starting powders and can be used to produce extremely high production volumes of parts due to the use of conventional pressing processes 
fabrication of translucent ceramics transtar 
ceradyne produces translucent aluminum oxide transtar components primarily for use as orthodontic ceramic brackets 
the high purity powders are purchased from outside vendors and processed by dedicated conventional ceramic mechanical dry presses 
the formed blanks are then fired in a segregated furnace in a hydrogen atmosphere at f until the ceramics enter into a strong translucent condition 
these fired aesthetic brackets then have certain critical features diamond ground into them 
the final step is a proprietary treatment of the bonding side in order to permit a sound mechanical seal when bound to the patient s teeth 
diamond grinding 
many of ceradyne s advanced technical ceramic products must be finished by diamond grinding because of their extreme hardness 
the company s finished components typically are machined to tolerances of 
inch and occasionally are machined to tolerances up to 
inch 
to a limited extent  the company also performs diamond grinding services for customers independently of its other manufacturing processes to specifications provided by the customer 
the company s diamond grinding department can perform surface grinding  diameter grinding  ultrasonic diamond grinding  diamond lapping  diamond slicing and honing 
the equipment includes manual  automatic and computer numerically controlled cnc grinders 
the cnc grinders have been specially adapted by the company for precision grinding of ceramic contours to exacting tolerances 
fabrication of samarium cobalt permanent magnets 
the fabrication of samarium cobalt permanent magnets results in various magnet shapes which are primarily used in microwave tube applications 
the company procures premixed samarium cobalt powder either as smco or smcoco 
compositions 
the powders are then milled and formed into the final configuration by pressing in a magnetic field using a specially designed magnet press 
these pre fire or green magnets are then sintered at f in helium or vacuum 
the magnets may then be subsequently diamond ground and characterized as to each individual magnet s strength 
raw materials 
the starting raw materials for ceradyne s manufacturing operations are generally fine  man made powders available from several domestic and foreign sources 
the raw materials  such as kevlar tm  graphite  metal components and ceramic powders are readily available from several commercial sources 
quality control 
ceradyne products are made to a number of exacting specifications 
in order to meet both internal quality criteria and customer requirements  the company has implemented a number of quality assurance and in process statistical process control programs 
these quality programs are implemented separately at each of ceradyne s three manufacturing locations 
the company s thermo materials division in scottdale  georgia received its iso certification in the company s advanced ceramic operations in costa mesa  california received its iso certification in both certifications have been renewed 
engineering and research ceradyne s engineering and research efforts consist of applications engineering in response to customer requirements  in addition to new materials and product development performed by its research and development department 
these efforts are directed toward the creation of new products  the modification of existing products to fit specific customer needs  or the development of enhanced ceramic process technology 
the company is also engaged in research to develop new products 
costs associated with application engineering and research are generally expensed as incurred and are included in cost of product sales  or in research and development expense 
costs associated with research were approximately  in   in and  in the totals consist of   and  from the research and development department  and   and  from the engineering department included in cost of product sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
competition ceradyne competes on the basis of product performance  material specifications  applications engineering capabilities  customer support  reputation and price 
competitive pressures vary in each specific product market  depending on the product and program 
in many instances  the competitors are well known companies with greater financial  marketing and technical resources than ceradyne 
ceradyne intends to continue to focus on selected business areas in which it can exploit its technological  manufacturing and marketing strengths 
some of ceradyne s competitors are divisions of larger companies  with each of ceradyne s product lines subject to completely different competitors 
some of the competitors of the company include kyocera corporation s industrial ceramics group  vesuvius  cercom  coorstek  inc  spectra mat  armor holdings  inc  and others 
in many applications  the company also competes with manufacturers of non ceramic materials 
for future automotive applications  there is a wide range of both current and potential domestic and international competitors 
see risk factors the advanced technical ceramic markets are highly competitive 
backlog ceradyne records an item as backlog when it receives a contract or purchase order indicating the number of units to be purchased  the purchase price  specifications and other customary terms and conditions 
ceradyne customarily includes unexercised options as a separate item in its backlog because the purchase orders are given on the basis of the total order  including options 
total backlog as of december  was approximately million  consisting of million of firm scheduled orders and million of unexercised options 
as of december  total backlog approximated million  consisting of million of firm scheduled orders and million of unexercised options 
typically  firm orders are scheduled to be initially shipped within to weeks from receipt of order 
patents  licenses and trademarks the company relies primarily on trade secrecy to protect compositions and processes that it believes are proprietary 
in certain cases  the disclosure of information concerning such compositions or processes in issuing a patent could be competitively disadvantageous 
however  management believes that patents are important for technologies where trade secrecy alone is not a reliable source of protection 
accordingly  ceradyne has applied for  or has been granted  several united states patents relating to compositions  products or processes that management believes are proprietary  including lightweight ceramic armor 
two us patents have been issued to the company relating to translucent ceramics for orthodontic brackets 
the earliest of these patents expires in these patents are co invented and co owned by ceradyne and m unitek 
ceradyne and m unitek have granted licenses to eight companies whose ceramic orthodontic brackets infringe the ceradyne m unitek patents  wherein those companies pay royalties to ceradyne and m unitek based on sales of their orthodontic ceramic brackets for the remaining life of the patents 
see risk factors we may be adversely affected if we are unable to adequately safeguard our intellectual property or if we infringe others intellectual property 
through its association with ford  ceradyne acquired in excess of us patents  of which are still active  and corresponding foreign patents and applications relating to technical ceramics for automotive technology 
the last of these patents will expire in august see strategic relationships 
in addition to the above  ceradyne has been issued us patents and has patents pending and has applied for corresponding foreign patents in various foreign countries 
the earliest of these patents expires in ceralloy  the name of ceradyne s technical ceramics  ceradyne and the ceradyne logo  comprising the stylized letters cd  are major trademarks of the company which have been registered in the united states and various foreign countries 
the company also has other trademarks  including transtar  semicon  thermo  netshape  defender  needlelok  and ramtech 
employees at december   ceradyne employed approximately persons versus in the prior year 
the company utilizes temporary labor in some of its production operations 
management considers its employee relations to be excellent 
the company has not experienced difficulty in attracting personnel 
none of the company s employees are represented by a labor union 
risk factors this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of our actual results may differ materially from the results projected in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  the following we depend upon sales to agencies of the united states government  we face the risk that a key government contract may be terminated we have a million backlog of orders as of december  of this amount  approximately million  or  represents orders for defense applications  primarily ceramic armor plates for military personnel 
these orders are closely tied to the level of us defense spending 
certain contracts for ceramic armor or radomes are directly or indirectly with agencies of the united states government 
moreover  we anticipate that a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future will derive from direct or indirect sales to government agencies 
recently  the us military has been accelerating its program to equip its ground based combat personnel with ceramic body armor systems 
we believe the us military s requirements for ceramic armor plates will continue for an indefinite period of time 
however  demand for ceramic armor plates may decline when the number of body armor systems shipped is sufficient to equip front line troops  if conflicts in the middle east and other high risk areas subside  or if us defense budget appropriations are reduced 
furthermore  we must win future orders in an open  competitive government bid process to maintain our current level of business 
under us law  defense related contracts may be canceled by the government for convenience at any time and without cause 
if contracts are cancelled  we receive reimbursement only for the expenses we actually incurred 
any such cancellations could have material adverse effects on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we also operate in a geopolitical climate that is very sensitive and potentially volatile and could contribute to a disruption of orders and production 
we must successfully increase manufacturing capacity and improve product yields or our gross margins and profitability may suffer recently we have experienced a substantial increase in orders for ceramic armor vests for military personnel and for cam rollers for diesel engines 
we currently expect that demand for these products will require us to increase our production of ceramic armor vests in over  and increase production of cam rollers in over during  we invested in capital expenditures to increase production capacity for these two products  and we expect to make additional capital expenditures in to further expand our capacity 
even with these additions to production capacity there can be no assurance that we will be able to manufacture the required quantities of these products in a timely manner or on a profitable basis 
in order to successfully satisfy customer demand for these products while achieving acceptable profits  we must achieve significant manufacturing cost reductions  add manufacturing capacity and personnel  and improve product yields 
we have experienced inefficiencies inherent with the rapid ramp up in our manufacturing volumes that put pressure on our gross profit margins in  particularly in the first quarter 
for  we expect gross profit margins to gradually improve as we increase our product yields  manufacturing efficiencies and production processes 
however  there can be no assurance that the gross profit margins we ultimately achieve on higher volumes of these products will be comparable to our historical gross profit margins  especially in the automotive product line of ceramic cam rollers for diesel engines 
failure to manage our growth could adversely affect us the increase in orders for ceramic armor vests for military personnel and cam rollers for diesel engines  as well as the introduction of new products  is placing  and will continue to place  a significant strain on our resources and personnel 
to continue our growth  we must increase our production capacity for our existing products and introduce new products that apply our core advanced technical ceramic technologies 
managing this growth will strain our operational  financial and managerial resources into the foreseeable future 
to effectively manage growth  we must add manufacturing capacity and personnel  continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and management information systems  develop the management skills of our managers and supervisors  add new management personnel and improve the expertise of existing management personnel  and train  motivate and manage our employees 
any failure to effectively manage growth could have material adverse effects on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are considering relocating some of our california operations  the move would be expensive and  if not managed properly  could adversely affect our business ceradyne s goal is to be a low cost producer of its products 
however  certain costs of our california operations continue to increase 
the costs of energy  rental of production facilities and logistics are cheaper in other parts of the united states 
consequently  we are investigating the relocation of some of our california manufacturing operations to a location outside of california 
managing this relocation effort will put pressures on our operational  financial and managerial resources 
to effectively manage this relocation effort  we must reduce  close and move certain manufacturing capacity  equipment and personnel  retain and relocate managerial and production personnel  implement and improve our operational  financial and management information systems in a new location  add new personnel and develop their production skills  add new management personnel and improve the expertise of existing management personnel  and train  motivate and manage our employees 
the relocation will involve substantial expense  including capital expenditures  and could disrupt operations 
any failure to effectively manage this relocation effort could have material adverse effects on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we depend on joel p 
moskowitz and our other key personnel our success largely depends on the continued service of our principal managers 
many of these managers  and in particular joel p 
moskowitz  who is chairman  chief executive officer and president  and a principal stockholder of ceradyne  would be extremely difficult to replace 
we also depend on other key personnel  and our ability to attract  motivate and retain highly qualified personnel 
competition for skilled employees is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to recruit and retain such personnel 
if we are unable to retain our existing managers and employees or hire and integrate new employees  it could have material adverse effects on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the advanced technical ceramics markets are highly competitive the markets for applications of advanced technical ceramics are competitive 
we believe the principal competitive factors in these matters are product performance  material specifications  application engineering capabilities  customer support  reputation  and price at present  while we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors  this may change 
if we fail to address our competitive challenges  there could be material adverse effects on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our competitors include divisions of larger companies and manufacturers of non ceramic materials 
many of these competitors  both domestic and international  have greater financial  marketing and technical resources than we do 
our primary competitors include kyocera corporation s industrial ceramics group  vesuvius  cercom  coorstek  inc  spectra mat  armor holdings  inc  and others 
not only do we compete with many large companies  but each of our product lines compete with completely different companies 
we cannot guaranty that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competition will not have material adverse effects on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we could be liable for violations of environmental laws and regulations we are subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous materials used to manufacture our products 
authorities could impose fines  suspend production  alter our manufacturing processes  or stop our operations if we do not comply with these regulations 
in the past  we produced certain products using beryllium oxide  which is highly toxic in powder form 
this powder  if inhaled  can cause chronic beryllium disease in a small percentage of the population 
we have been sued in the past by former employees and by employees of one of our customers and by their family members alleging that they had contracted chronic beryllium disease as a result of exposure to beryllium oxide powders used in our products 
all of these claims have been dismissed without incurring material liability 
we cannot guaranty that we will avoid future liability to persons who may allege that they contracted chronic beryllium disease as a result of exposure to beryllium oxide utilized by ceradyne in prior years 
while we believe we are in material compliance with all applicable environmental statutes and regulations  any failure to comply with current or subsequently enacted statutes and regulations could subject us to liabilities  fines or the suspension of production 
furthermore  any claims asserted against us in the future related to exposure to beryllium oxide powder may not be covered by insurance 
even if covered  the amount of insurance may be inadequate to cover any adverse judgment 
fines and other punishments imposed in connection with environmental violations and expenses related to remediation or compliance with environmental regulations and future liability for incidences of chronic beryllium disease contracted by employees or employees of customers could have material adverse effects on our business  operating results and financial condition 
sales of our ceramic orthodontic brackets depend on our exclusive marketing and sales relationship with unitek  a division of m corporation we developed our translucent ceramic orthodontic bracket pursuant to a joint development agreement with unitek 
we sell this product only to unitek pursuant to an exclusive marketing agreement  which expires in consequently  our sales of this product depend entirely on unitek s marketing and sales efforts 
we cannot guaranty that unitek will devote substantial marketing efforts to sales of our orthodontic products  or that unitek will not reassess its commitment to our technologies or develop its own competitive technologies 
if unitek fails to actively market our orthodontic brackets  there may be material adverse effects on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our international sales are subject to risks associated with operating in international markets shipments to customers outside of the united states accounted for approximately of our sales in  in  and in we anticipate that international shipments will account for a portion of our sales for the foreseeable future 
therefore  the following risks associated with international business activities could have material adverse effects on our performance burdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations  including export requirements  tariffs and other barriers  health and safety requirements  and unexpected changes in any of the foregoing  difficulty in obtaining export licenses from the us government  differences in intellectual property protections  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences due to overlapping or differing tax structures  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and risks associated with sales to foreign government agencies similar to the risks associated with dealing with us government agencies 
we have traditionally invoiced our foreign sales in us dollars 
accordingly  we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions that could protect against the risk of currency fluctuations 
this approach could pose risks 
if the us dollar were to become more expensive relative to the currencies of our foreign customers  the price of our products in those countries rises and our sales into those countries  or our profitability within those countries  may fall 
future international activity may require that we denominate foreign sales in the local currencies of our customers 
in that case  if the us dollar were to become more expensive relative to the currencies of our foreign customers  we would receive fewer us dollars for each unit of foreign currency that we receive when our customers pay us 
therefore  a more expensive us dollar would cause us to incur losses upon the conversion of accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
such losses could harm our results of operations 
we cannot export some of our products to certain foreign countries without an export license obtained from the us government 
we have experienced difficulty in obtaining licenses to export our products to certain countries 
similar difficulties may arise again in the future 
if any of the above risks emerge  there may be material adverse effects on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may be adversely affected if we are unable to adequately safeguard our intellectual property or if we infringe on other s intellectual property we rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets  trademarks  and other intellectual property law  nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to preserve our proprietary rights to our products and production processes 
these measures afford only limited protection and may not preclude competitors from developing products or processes similar or superior to ours 
moreover  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
although we implement protective measures and intend to defend our proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that these efforts will succeed 
we may have to litigate within the united states or abroad to enforce patents issued or licensed to us  to protect trade secrets or know how owned by us or to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of our proprietary rights and the proprietary rights of others 
enforcing or defending our proprietary rights could be expensive and might not bring us timely and effective relief 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that our products or processes are not in violation of the patent rights of third parties  or that any of our patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
although there are no pending or threatened intellectual property lawsuits against us  we may face litigation or infringement claims in the future 
infringement claims could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources even if we ultimately prevail 
a third party claiming infringement may also obtain an injunction or other equitable relief  which could effectively block the distribution or sale of allegedly infringing products 
although we may seek licenses from third parties covering intellectual property that we are allegedly infringing  we cannot guarantee that any such licenses could be obtained on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  or if we face claims for infringement on the intellectual property of third parties  there may be material adverse effects on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we depend on ford motor company to sell and market the ballistic protection series that contains our products 
we are subject to risks associated with the marketing and sales of these vehicles 
we rely entirely on the ford motor company s efforts to sell and market its lincoln town car ballistic protection series bps 
there can be no assurance that this product will sell in the quantities or levels that ford has forecasted 
nor is there any assurance that the style and design of this car will be popular with the public 
we cannot guaranty that ford will devote substantial marketing efforts to promote the sales of this product or that ford will not reassess its commitment to our ceramic technologies or develop its own competitive technologies 
if ford fails to actively market lincoln town car ballistic protection series  there may be costs that we would be required to expense thus impacting our business and operating results

the company did not sell any equity securities during the year ended december  that were not registered under the securities act of item selected financial data statements of operations data amounts in thousands  except per share data years ended december  net sales cost of product sales gross profit operating expenses selling general and administrative research and development income loss from operations other income expense other income interest expense income before provision benefit for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income basic net income per share diluted net income per share weighted average shares outstanding diluted balance sheet data december  working capital total assets long term obligations stockholders equity item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s technology was developed primarily for defense and aerospace applications  which have historically represented and continue to represent a substantial portion of its business 
utilizing this historical base  the company has transitioned over several years to a more balanced product offering  including industrial  consumer  microwave tube products  automotive  semiconductor  and defense applications 
the company s cost of product sales includes the cost of materials  direct labor expenses and manufacturing overhead expenses 
the company s business requires that it maintain a relatively high fixed manufacturing overhead 
as a result  the company s gross profit  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales  is greatly impacted by the company s sales volume and the corresponding absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses 
furthermore  due to the customized nature of many of its products  the company is frequently required to devote resources to sustaining engineering expenses  which are also included in cost of product sales and are expensed as incurred 
results of operations the percentage relationships to net sales of certain income and expense items for the three years ended december   and are contained in the following table 
years ended december net sales cost of product sales gross profit operating expenses selling general administrative research development income from operations other income interest expense income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income years ended december  and net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or compared to the prior year 
advanced ceramic operations in costa mesa  california  had an increase in sales for the year ended december  of million or as compared to the year ago period 
the sales increase was mainly due to a million or increase in ceramic armor shipments for defense customers and an increase of million or in the automotive business compared to the year ago period 
also  sales increased for the research and development contracts awarded by the department of defense over the prior year 
the company s semicon associates division in lexington  kentucky  posted a sales decrease of million 
decreases were mainly due to a slow down in demand by the company s customers for dispenser cathodes  which are used in microwave tubes for radar and satellite communications 
additionally  the company s thermo materials division in scottdale  georgia  posted a sales increase of million as compared to the prior year period 
the increase in sales was attributable to an increase in demand for fused silica products domestically by the glass  steel and aluminum making industries 
international sales have been  and are expected to be  an important part of the company s business  representing million  or of total sales  for the year ended as compared to million  or of total sales  in the reasons for the decrease were due to the company s relatively slow sales in england and decreases in armor components for israel while total sales increased 
gross profit 
the company s gross profit was million  or of net sales  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of net sales  for the prior year 
the increase in gross profit for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year was 
million or 
advanced ceramic operations gross profit margins as a percentage of sales were negatively impacted by a  warranty reserve for sapi armor plates that was recorded in the second quarter of gross margins were also impacted by certain other manufacturing and production inefficiencies because of steep manufacturing learning curves to scale up to full production in the automotive line 
moreover  the company experienced poor product yields and other manufacturing inefficiencies as production capacities were being increased to meet rising demand for personal armor and diesel engine components 
to overcome these issues  the company is employing lean manufacturing techniques and investing in and improving personnel training 
to increase gross margins and reduce inventories  the company is in the process of completing implementation of demand flow technology dft 
dft is a scaleable  mathematically based business strategy  specifically designed to allow manufacturers to respond faster and more efficiently to the needs of their customers and the marketplace 
its primary purpose is to increase the flow of goods in a manufacturing environment to lower costs and gain efficiencies 
semicon associates in lexington  kentucky  posted gross profit of million  compared to million  or a decrease over the prior year 
the decrease compared to the prior year is attributed to lower plant overhead absorption because of lower sales and production 
thermo materials in scottdale  georgia  posted gross profit of million  compared to 
million  or a increase over the prior year 
the increase was attributable to higher production volume and the elimination of process control problems in fused silica products 
the process control concern was corrected by diligent testing of raw materials 
selling expenses 
selling expenses were  for the year ended december   as compared to  in the prior year 
salary and personnel increases  commissions and travel account for the increased selling expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   a 
million increase from the prior year 
salary and personnel increases accounted primarily for the increased expenses 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the prior year 
this increase was due to the company s program of increased investing for development of future ceramic technology and new products 
the expenses incurred for both years are related to wages for engineering  technicians and production personnel  materials  outside services  small tools and travel 
in addition  approximately 
million of research and development cost is in cost of sales due to small business innovation research sbir grants  which are recorded as sales 
in addition  the company historically has and continues to engage in application engineering and internally funded research to improve and reduce the cost of production and to develop new products 
the costs associated with application engineering and research are expensed as incurred and are included in cost of product sales 
other income 
other income was  and  for the years ended and  respectively 
other income includes royalty income  which increased over the prior year due to greater demand for orthodontic brackets 
interest income decreased by  due to lower cash balances due to increases in inventory levels relating to armor and automotive product lines 
interest expense 
interest expense was  for the year ended december   compared to  in the prior year 
this increase was attributable to higher inventory levels causing more borrowing from the line of credit 
income taxes 
the company used a combined federal and state tax rate of for the twelve months ended december   resulting in a provision for taxes of  the increase in the tax provision was the result of releasing valuation allowances in the prior year 
years ended december  and net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of 
million  or compared to the prior year 
advanced ceramic operations in costa mesa  california  had a decrease in sales for the year ended december  of 
million as compared to the year ago period 
the sales decrease was mainly in ceramic armor for defense customers due to the delay of armor vest orders  which were not received until late in the fourth quarter 
also  sales of semiconductor products decreased from the prior year because of the downturn in this industry 
however  these sales decreases were nearly offset by growth in orthodontic products due to an increasing demand by orthodontists for our translucent ceramic brackets 
also  sales increased for the research and development contracts awarded by the department of defense over the prior year 
the company s semicon associates division in lexington  kentucky  posted a sales increase of 
million 
increases were mainly due to demand by the company s customers for dispenser cathodes  which are used in microwave tubes for radar and satellite communications 
in addition  sales increases were due to modest price increases and a contract award from the department of defense 
additionally  the company s thermo materials division in scottdale  georgia  posted a sales decrease of 
million as compared to the prior year period 
the decrease in sales was mainly caused by less demand for fused silica products due to downsizing domestically by the glass  steel and aluminum making industries 
international sales represented of total sales for the year ended as compared to in the reasons for the increase were the company s relatively new sales efforts in england and china  and increases in armor components for israel 
gross profit 
the company s gross profit was million  or of net sales  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of net sales  for the prior year 
the increase in gross profit for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year was 
million or 
the company s advanced ceramic operations in costa mesa  california  posted gross profit of million compared to million  or a increase over the prior year 
the favorable results were mainly due to higher volume of parts and higher capacity utilization resulting in economies of scale 
however  the company leased a new facility in december containing approximately  square feet  most of which will be used for manufacturing  and it will take time to absorb this additional capacity and realize the same level of economies of scale as were achieved in moreover  the company is experiencing poor product yields and other manufacturing inefficiencies as production capacities are being increased to meet rising demand for personal armor and diesel engine components 
consequently  gross profit margins are expected to decrease in the first six months of as compared to  but gradually improve thereafter 
however  gross profit dollars are expected to be higher in as compared to because of increases in sales volume 
semicon associates in lexington  kentucky  posted gross profit of million  compared to million  or a increase over the prior year 
the increase over the prior year is attributed to better quality and process control and greater capacity utilization and is being partially funded by a contract award from the department of defense 
the mission of this department of defense production act title iii program is to create assured  affordable and commercially viable production capabilities for items essential for national defense 
additionally  modest price increases were contributing factors 
the company expects the trend of gross profit as a percent of sales to stabilize 
thermo materials in scottdale  georgia  posted gross profit of 
million  compared to million  or a decrease over the prior year 
the decreases were attributable to lower production volume and to a process control problem in fused silica products 
the process control concern has subsequently been corrected by diligent testing of raw materials

we apply our accounting policies on a consistent basis 
as circumstances change  they are considered in our estimates and judgments  and future changes in circumstances could result in changes in amounts at which assets and liabilities are recorded 
they could also affect the estimated useful levels of property and equipment  which could result in changes in depreciation expense or write offs or write downs of such assets 
accounts receivable the company reviews its trade accounts receivables and its estimates of the allowance for doubtful accounts each period 
the allowance for doubtful accounts includes management s estimate of the amount expected to be uncollectable on specific accounts and unidentified accounts included in accounts receivable 
in estimating the potential losses on specific accounts  management relies on in house prepared analysis  historical experience and a review of other available information 
the amounts the company will ultimately realize could differ materially from the amounts assumed in arriving at the allowance for doubtful accounts in the accompanying financial statements 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
the write down of inventory for obsolete items is based on management s estimate of the amount considered obsolete based on specific reviews of inventory items 
in estimating the allowance  management relies on its knowledge of the industry as well as its current inventory levels 
the amounts the company will ultimately realize could differ from amounts estimated by management 
inventory costs include the cost of material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
production tooling the company s production tooling primarily consists of graphite tooling used in the manufacturing and furnace processes 
this tooling is being amortized over three to nine months 
warranty reserve the us government defense logistics agency dla notified the company on march   that lots of ceradyne s small arms protective inserts sapi for light weight ceramic armor shipped in january failed to pass ballistics reverification tests by the government s designated independent commercial testing laboratory 
during the period of december through march   the company had shipped approximately million under its existing contract with the dla 
subsequent to march   the dla directed the independent testing laboratory to perform reverification testing and million of the shipments were not in testing compliance 
upon first being notified of these issues on march   the company voluntarily stopped producing its original sapi design and thereafter actively worked with the government to understand the quality and testing issues and to resolve the status and disposition of the sapi plates in question 
the company has completed the development of a modified design for its ceramic sapi armor plates 
independently performed tests by the government s designated testing laboratory of the modified design have been successful and the first article initial production parts of this modified design was approved in june in july  the company received a million delivery order from the us army for its newly designed  robust small arms protective inserts sapi design ii 
shipments began in july and were completed during the fourth quarter of on august   the company signed an amendment to the contract with the government regarding certain of the sapi plates shipped in december  and the first quarter the amendment requires that the company correct or replace at its expense all supplies of the product that did not meet the original contractual requirements 
the warranty items are to be delivered over the period from october through june the company estimates the cost to rework and upgrade the sapi plates at approximately  and set up a warranty reserve in that amount  recorded in the second quarter ended june  against cost of goods sold 
as of december   the balance of the reserve was  liquidity and capital resources the company generally meets its operating and capital requirements for cash flow from operating activities and borrowings under its credit facility 
on may   the company increased from million to million its revolving credit facility with comerica bank 
as of december   the balance owed under the credit facility was million  which was used for operating needs 
the credit line was increased to fund the present and future growth of the company 
pursuant to the loan  the company is subject to certain covenants  which include  among other things  the maintenance of minimum net worth  minimum ratio of quick assets to current liabilities  and maximum ratio of total liabilities to net worth 
as of december   the company was in compliance with these covenants

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on its debt 
currently  the company does not utilize interest rate swaps  forward or option contracts on foreign currencies or commodities  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
the purpose of the following analysis is to provide a framework to understand the company s sensitivity to hypothetical changes in interest rates as of december  many of the statements contained in this section are forward looking and should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures under the heading risk factors 
the company utilized debt financing during primarily for the purpose of acquiring manufacturing equipment 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument  but not the company s earnings or cash flows 
the company does not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until the company would be required to refinance such debt 
the fair market value estimates for debt securities are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to the company for debt of the same type and remaining maturity 
at december   we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on  of variable rate bank borrowings on our bank line of credit 
fluctuation in the interest rate environment will not affect our future earnings and cash flows on our fixed rate debt until that debt matures and management deems it necessary to be replaced or refinanced 
interest rate changes will affect the fair value of the fixed rate instruments 
conversely  changes in interest rates on variable rate debt would change our future earnings and cash flows  but not affect the fair value on those instruments 
assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variable rate debt from the bank line of credit  and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of year end  interest expense for would increase by approximately  or 
per common share on a diluted basis 
we do not have any significant foreign currency risk 
sales to foreign distributors are all denominated in us dollars
