item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial review critical accounting policies litigation abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
under sfas no 
 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management s best estimate of a loss  or when a best estimate cannot be made  a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded 
these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are refined each accounting period  as additional information is known 
accordingly  abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss  and therefore the minimum amount  which could be zero  is recorded 
as information becomes known  either the minimum loss amount is increased  resulting in additional loss provisions  or a best estimate can be made  also resulting in additional loss provisions 
occasionally  a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected 
as noted below  abbott is unable to estimate a loss  if any  for the industry wide enteral nutritional business investigation 
sales rebates a large part of abbott s domestic businesses sell products to distributors who resell the products to the end customers 
abbott must provide rebates to members of buying groups who purchase from abbott s distributors  to distributors that sell to their customers at prices determined under a contract between abbott and the customer  or to state agencies  which administer various programs such as the federal medicaid and medicare programs and the special supplemental food program for women  infants  and children 
rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases or by reference to a specific price for a product 
therefore  abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid  and records the liability as a reduction of revenue when abbott records its sale of the product 
settlement of the rebate generally occurs from three to months after sale 
abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to recorded reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs 
income taxes abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments 
because abbott operates globally  the nature of the audit items are often very complex  and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country 
the company employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible 
as part of abbott s calculation of the provision for taxes on earnings  abbott records the amount that it expects to incur as a result of audits 
in the united states  the internal revenue service is currently auditing abbott s us income tax returns for the years through pension and post employment benefits abbott offers pension benefits and post employment health care to many of its employees 
abbott engages outside actuaries to calculate its obligations under these programs 
with the assistance of outside actuaries  abbott must develop long term assumptions  the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rate  discount rate and the expected return on plan assets 
differences between the expected return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over a five year period 
a difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates  which will not be known for decades  can be significant in relation to the obligation and the annual expense recorded for these programs 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate  however  there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point 
in  abbott recorded minimum pension liability adjustments of million because the accumulated benefit obligations for certain domestic and international defined benefit plans exceeded the market value of the plans assets 
this resulted in a charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss of million  net of taxes 
the discount rate used in for determining the accumulated benefit obligations was 
a one percentage point reduction in the discount rate would result in an increase in the minimum pension liability adjustments of approximately million 
valuation of intangible assets abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that abbott values and records 
those assets which do not yet have regulatory approval and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed as acquired in process research and development  and those that have regulatory approval are capitalized 
generally  transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field  and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
abbott uses a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets acquired and for the assessment of impairment 
the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash inflows and outflows  risk  the cost of capital  and terminal values 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 
abbott engages independent valuation experts who review abbott s critical assumptions for significant acquisitions of intangibles 
abbott reviews intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach 
if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset  the intangible asset is written down to the discounted cash flow value 
where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset  the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment to goodwill occurs

abbott has periodically sold product rights to non strategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with abbott s revenue recognition policies as discussed in note gains recorded in net sales were million in  million in and million in on december   the fda approved humira for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
worldwide sales of humira are forecasted to be more than million in the expiration of patent protection can affect the future revenues and operating income of abbott 
significant patent expirations and activities in the next three years are as follows 
the original us compound patent on clarithromycin expires in approximately of the us sales of clarithromycin in were made under a form covered by patents that expire later than us sales of clarithromycin were million in abbott markets tricor in the us under a license agreement 
patents covering tricor are being challenged by competitors 
abbott is vigorously defending the patents 
us sales of tricor were million in an nda for synthroid  which is not protected by a patent  was approved by the fda in the fda is studying the conditions under which competitors may rely on abbott s nda to market a competitive product 
us sales of synthroid were million in operating earnings gross profit margins sales less cost of products sold  including distribution expenses were percent of net sales in  percent in and percent in the gross profit margin for was negatively impacted by the fda consent decree charge  restructuring charges  both as discussed below  and unfavorable product mix  partially offset by absence of goodwill amortization in the decrease in the gross profit margin in was due primarily to increased goodwill and intangibles amortization and integration charges as a result of the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of basf 
gross profit margins in all years were also affected by productivity improvements  higher project expenses for new products  higher manufacturing capacity costs for anticipated unit growth  and the effects of inflation and competitive pricing pressures 
in the us  states receive price rebates from manufacturers of infant formula under the federally subsidized special supplemental food program for women  infants  and children 
there are also rebate programs for pharmaceutical products 
these rebate programs continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margins of the ross and pharmaceutical products segments 
in addition  the gross profit margins for the ross segment were negatively impacted due to pricing pressure and unfavorable product mix 
the gross profit margins for the pharmaceutical products segment were unfavorably impacted in by unfavorable product mix and favorably impacted in by favorable product mix 
the gross profit margins for the diagnostic products segment were negatively impacted by the effect of the consent decree for all three years  as discussed below 
in november  abbott reached agreement with the us government to have a consent decree entered to settle issues involving abbott s diagnostics manufacturing operations in lake county  ill 
the decree  which was amended in december  requires abbott to ensure its diagnostics manufacturing processes in lake county conform with the us food and drug administration s fda quality system regulation qsr 
the decree allows for the continued manufacture and distribution of medically necessary diagnostic products made in lake county 
however  abbott is prohibited from manufacturing or distributing certain diagnostic products until abbott ensures the processes in its lake county diagnostics manufacturing operations conform with the qsr 
the decree allows abbott to export diagnostic products and components for sale and distribution outside the united states if they meet the export requirements of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
under the terms of the amended consent decree  abbott was to ensure its diagnostics manufacturing operations are in conformance with the qsr by january  the fda performed an inspection of abbott s lake county  ill 
diagnostics manufacturing operations during the fourth quarter of and first quarter of to determine whether those operations are in conformity with the qsr 
in may  these operations were found not to be in conformity 
accordingly  abbott was required to make additional payments to the government and continue its efforts to achieve full compliance 
a pretax charge of million  or cents per share  related to this matter was recorded in cost of products sold in the fda will determine abbott s conformance with the qsr after a re inspection of abbott s facilities 
if the fda concludes that the operations are not in conformance with the qsr  abbott may continue to be subject to additional costs and loss of revenue 
the consent decree affects the sales and margin of the immunochemistry products of the diagnostic products segment 
research and development expense was billion in and  and billion in  and represented percent of net sales in  compared to percent of net sales in  and percent of net sales in the decline in research and development as a percentage of sales in was due  in part  to the decline in spending on phase iii clinical trials in research and development expenditures continue to be concentrated on pharmaceutical and diagnostic products 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent in  net of the favorable effect of the relatively stronger us dollar of percent  compared to increases of percent in  and percent in the increases in selling  general and administration in and were due  in part  to the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of basf in and for as the result of restructuring charges 
the increases  net of exchange  in all three years also reflect inflation and additional selling and marketing support primarily in the international  pharmaceutical and hospital segments

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments and risk management interest rate sensitive financial instruments at december  and  abbott had interest rate hedge contracts totaling billion to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of billion of long term debt due in july and abbott does not use derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities 
as of december   and  abbott had billion and billion  respectively  of domestic commercial paper outstanding with an average interest rate of and  respectively  and with an average remaining life of days and days  respectively 
the fair market value of long term debt at december   and  amounted to billion and billion  respectively  and consisted primarily of fixed rate average of debt with maturities through as of december   and  the fair market value of current and long term investment securities maturing through amounted to million and million  respectively 
approximately percent and percent of these investments as of december   and  respectively  have fixed interest rates average of and  respectively  while the remaining investments have variable rates 
a hypothetical basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows  income or market values 
a basis point change is a reasonably possible near term change in rates 
market price sensitive financial instruments abbott maintains a portfolio of available for sale equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions 
the market value of these investments was approximately million and million  respectively  as of december   and a hypothetical percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease the fair value at december  by approximately million 
a percent decrease is a reasonably possible near term change in share prices

the carrying value of these investments was approximately million and million  respectively  as of december   and abbott monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value  and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in estimated value occurs 
foreign currency sensitive financial instruments abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and third party trade payables and receivables 
the contracts are marked to market  and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed 
at december   and  abbott held billion and billion  respectively  of such contracts  which all mature in the next calendar year 
in addition  certain abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the us dollar 
these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in the foreign exchange rates and are marked to market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
gains or losses will be included in cost of sales at the time the products are sold  generally within the next calendar year
