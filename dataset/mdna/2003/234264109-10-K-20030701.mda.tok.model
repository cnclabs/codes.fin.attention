item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion highlights the principal factors affecting changes in financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
overview the company designs  manufactures  and sells a wide range of computer programmable information display systems to customers in a variety of markets throughout the world 
the company focuses its sales and marketing efforts on geographical regions  markets and products 
the primary categories of markets include sport  business  and transportation 
the company s net sales and profitability historically have fluctuated due to the impact of large product orders  such as display systems for major league sport facilities and colleges and universities  as well as the seasonality of the sports market 
net sales also fluctuate due to seasonality factors  including the timing of the various sports seasons and the impact of holidays  which primarily impact the company s third quarter 
the company s gross margins on large product orders tend to fluctuate more than those for small standard orders 
large product orders that involve competitive bidding and substantial subcontract work for product installation generally have lower gross margins 
although the company follows the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues for larger custom orders  the company nevertheless has experienced fluctuations in operating results and expects that its future results of operations may be subject to similar fluctuations 
the company operates on a week fiscal year  with fiscal years ending on the saturday closest to april of each year 
fiscal year contains weeks and the first quarter of fiscal year contained weeks as compared to the more typical week year and week quarter 
for a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements and the effects of those pronouncements on the financial results of the company  refer to note of the financial statements of the company  which are included elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a regular basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to estimated total costs on long term contracts  estimated costs to be incurred for product warranties and extended maintenance contracts  bad debts  excess and obsolete inventory and contingencies 
its estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition on long term contracts 
earnings on long term contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to estimated total costs for each contract 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are estimable 
generally  contracts entered into by the company have fixed prices established and to the extent the actual costs to complete contracts are higher than the amounts estimated as of the date of the financial statements  the resulting gross margin would be negatively affected in future quarters when the company revises its estimates 
the company s practice is to revise estimates as soon as such changes in estimates become known 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
as of may   the company had an allowance for doubtful accounts balance of approximately million 
warranties 
the company has created a reserve for warranties on its products equal to its estimate of the actual costs to be incurred in connection with its performance under the standard warranty 
in the event that the company would become aware of an increase in its warranty reserves additional reserves may become necessary  resulting in an increase in costs of goods sold 
as of may   the company had a total of approximately million deferred for these costs 
extended warranty and product maintenance 
the company has deferred revenue related to separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance agreements 
in the event that the company would become aware of an increase in its estimated costs under these agreements in excess of its deferred revenue  additional reserves may be necessary  resulting in an increase in costs of goods sold 
as of may   approximated in additional reserves were provided for 
inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
market refers to the current replacement cost  except that market may not exceed the net realizable value ie  estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonable predictable costs of completion and disposal  and market is not less than the net realizable value reduced by an allowance for normal profit margins 
in valuing inventory the company estimates market value where it is believed to be the lower of cost or market and any necessary charges are charged to costs of goods sold in the period in which it occurs 
all other inventory is valued at cost 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of net sales represented by items included in the company s consolidated statements of income for the fiscal years ended may   april  and april  years ended may  april  april  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses operating income interest income interest expense other income expense  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income net sales net sales increased to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year net sales in all three major markets of the company increased in fiscal year over fiscal year the increases in the sports markets were across all components from smaller institutions such as high schools and recreation centers  to professional sports facilities 
the most significant area of growth was in the mid sized institutions  primarily colleges  universities  minor league sports facilities and larger municipal stadiums and arenas 
although professional sports facilities sales were also up during the year  its rate of growth slowed and net sales to professional sports facilities are expected to decline in fiscal year from the company believes that the growth in the sports market was due primarily to growth in market share  an expanding market as the company s products have become more affordable  and its overall product offerings which the company believes are the most complete and integrated systems in the marketplace 
in addition  it benefits from its network of sales and service offices throughout the country  giving it the ability to serve its customers more effectively 
the company believes that the effects of the economy have a lesser impact on the sports market  as compared to its other markets since its products are generally revenue generation tools through advertising for facilities and the sports business in general is a recession resistant business 
it does  however  expect that a continuation of current economic conditions will have an impact on sales 
finally  during the second half of fiscal year  there were significant changes in the mix of competitors seeking business in the united states sports markets  however the company believes it is still well positioned with respect to the competition 
orders in the sports markets were also up during the year 
most of the increase in order bookings was concentrated in the mid sized institutions 
orders related to professional sports facilities were down year over year  however in the last quarter of fiscal year  the company booked an unusually high level of orders for major league facilities which generated net sales in fiscal year the increase in net sales for the business markets was the result of an expanding line of products  a growing distribution network and the overall growth in product acceptance  as commercial establishments understand the advantages of led based electronic displays 
these positive factors have been partially offset by the declining economic conditions and the constraints that exist in the marketplace in general related to the obtaining of permits to install electronic displays 
in addition  the company has focused on sales to national accounts  primarily national retail type organizations and billboard companies 
during the year  sales to this area of the market began to decline  however the company believes that this portion of the business market will see growth in the future 
the company also believes that sales in the business market is expected to continue expanding at rates faster than what the company experienced in fiscal year  however growth in this market is dependant on the state of the economy 
the increase in orders for the year in this market was also due to the same factors affecting sales as most of the business in this market is comprised of orders that generally ship quickly compared to orders in some other markets of the company where lead times may be longer 
the increase in sales in the transportation market was due to a number of factors  including the overall product offerings  and its efforts in previous years to grow and develop its relationships with customers  including departments of transportation and transportation system integrators  resulting in repeat sales 
the increase in the transportation market was partially offset by a decline in sales in the aviation portion of the market which is primarily the result of the state of that business overall  but also due to the inclusion in fiscal year of a single large order for a major airline 
no similar order in that portion of the transportation market existed in fiscal year the increase in orders for the year in this market was also due to the same factors affecting sales 
net sales decreased to million for fiscal year as compared to approximately million for fiscal year net sales in the sports and transportation markets increased in fiscal year over fiscal year  while sales in the business markets declined  offsetting the sports and transportation increases 
the increases in the sports markets were primarily in smaller venues as compared to larger venues 
the larger venue revenues were down as a result of the actual timing of orders  which were booked later than expected in the fourth quarter of fiscal year order bookings were up in all categories of the sports market  including large and small venues 
the decline in net sales for the business markets in fiscal year as compared to was the result of the slowing economic conditions experienced during most of the second half of fiscal year and the impact of a large order in fiscal year that was not repeated in fiscal year a single large order in the business market had contributed approximately million in net sales in fiscal year excluding the revenue from that single large order  sales in the business market were approximately flat in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year finally  offsetting the decline in the business markets due to the factors mentioned was an increase in sales to national accounts in the fourth quarter of fiscal year overall sales in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year were affected by delays in booking orders across all markets beginning late in the second quarter and through the third quarter as customers hesitated due to the effects on the economy after the events of september  as the company progressed into the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the trend of flat and declining sales overall reversed and the company began to see increasing sales 
the company s backlog at the end of the fiscal year was approximately million  as compared to million at the end of fiscal year the backlog was primarily in the sports markets and as compared to fiscal year was comprised of a more regular stream of order bookings occurring throughout the months preceding the end of the fiscal year 
this compares to the backlog at the end of fiscal year which was higher than what would have been expected in the normal course of business as an unusually large number of orders booked late in the fourth quarter as a result of orders being delayed in mid to late fiscal year due to the events of september  backlog varies significantly quarter to quarter due to the effects of large orders and significant variations can be expected as explained previously herein 
in addition  the company s backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales or net income  also explained previously 
the company occasionally sells products in exchange for advertising revenues from the scoreboard or display 
these sales represented less than of net sales for each of fiscal year  and the gross profit margin on these net sales has historically been comparable to or higher than the gross profit margin on other net sales of similar sized installations 
gross profit gross profit increased by from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year as a percent of net sales  gross profit increased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year the increase in gross margin dollars was due to the higher level of net sales mentioned above and an improvement in the gross profit as a percent of net sales 
the increase in the gross profit margins as a percent of net sales was due to a number of factors including improvements in raw materials costs  an overall improvement in expected margins at contract signing in the sports and business markets  and improved overhead absorption due to production volumes and benefits realized from cost reductions in fiscal year within the sports markets  the company experienced a decline in the gross margin percentage in the professional sports facilities portion of the sports markets during fiscal year due primarily to the competitive nature of the business in that area 
it also experienced declines in gross margin percentages in its transportation markets 
the increases in gross margin percentages were offset partially by negative impacts of costs incurred which are not expected to continue into as the company worked hard to reduce inventory levels  incurring higher costs related to excess and obsolete inventory 
the company continues to strive towards higher margin percentages  although depending on the actual mix of net sales in the future  margin percentages may not actually increase 
it does however expect that the gross margin percentage will decline to lower levels in fiscal year  but that it can increase gross margin percentage in and beyond 
gross profit decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross profit percentage increased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year the decrease in gross margin dollars was due to the lower level of sales in fiscal year mentioned above offset by improvements in the gross margin percentage on some specific long term contracts and an improvement in product mix between higher margin standard products and lower margin long term contracts 
the higher than expected margins on certain long term contracts resulted from various factors such as improvements in certain raw materials prices and higher negotiated margins on a few significant long term contracts 
the increases were offset partially by the negative impacts of inventory obsolescence 
operating expenses operating expenses  which are comprised of selling  general and administrative and product design and development costs increased by approximately from million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year overall operating costs were impacted through higher costs of insurance  personnel and employee benefit costs 
for fiscal year  operating expenses increased by approximately from million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year beginning with the third quarter of fiscal year  the company began building its operating expense infrastructure in preparation of the expected growth in net sales in fiscal year this buildup continued until the middle of the second quarter of fiscal year when the company began to see that the anticipated level of sales for the year would not be achievable 
beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year  the company undertook efforts to reduce certain operating expenses  keeping in mind its belief in the market as a whole and an expectation that the current economic conditions that the company was experiencing were not long term 
as such  operating expenses were not reduced to levels consistent with fiscal year net sales 
operating expenses were reduced to the levels that would support the company in a return to levels of growth which could be expected as the economy turned around and orders started to book again 
selling expenses 
selling expenses consist primarily of salaries  other employee related costs  travel and entertainment  facilities related costs for sales and service offices  and expenditures for marketing efforts including such things as collateral materials  conventions and trade shows  product demos and supplies 
selling expenses increased to million for fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses were and of net sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in selling expense dollars resulted from higher levels of personnel  and related costs due to the additional infrastructure put in place in connection with the expansion of the sales staff located outside of brookings  south dakota 
also  during fiscal year  the company wrote down the carrying costs of demonstration equipment by approximately  primarily as a result of a change in estimated lives of the equipment primarily due to technology improvements and replacement with newer equipment 
the company also experienced higher postage  marketing  depreciation and various other costs as a result of investments in infrastructure in its sales expansion and the growth in net sales 
these costs generally rise in connection with the growth of net sales 
the company expects selling expenses to increase in fiscal year  however as a percent of sales  it expects selling expenses to be equal to or less than fiscal year selling expenses increased to million for fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses were and of net sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increases in both actual amounts spent and the percentage of sales resulted from higher levels of personnel costs as the infrastructure was built as explained above 
during this time of higher costs  the company invested in personnel and offices as it expanded its sales force regionally  focusing on developing a stronger presence geographically and on building new business units within the company  primarily its keyframe sm business to support the needs of the higher priced  more complicated prostar and proad systems 
in connection with these higher personnel costs  the company also experienced higher costs in indirect categories  such as telephone and office expenses 
in addition  the company experienced higher bad debt expenses related to isolated issues  generally not related to product quality or service and higher commissions paid to resellers 
finally  during fiscal year the company spent more on advertising and related costs in order to achieve higher order bookings 
these increased costs were partially offset by a decline in product demo costs and lower travel costs as a result of more sales staff being located in geographic regions as opposed to the company s main facilities 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  other employee related costs  professional fees  shareholder relations costs  facilities and equipment related costs for administrative departments  amortization of intangibles and supplies 
general and administrative costs increased approximately to million in fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year as a percent of sales  general and administrative expenses were and of net sales for fiscal year and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal year related to higher compensation costs  primarily related to incentive compensation for executive management  whose incentive compensation is defined based on earnings achievement  higher costs of retirement benefits for executive management  higher depreciation costs related to prior years capital investments and  finally  higher professional fees related to higher audit costs related to the fiscal year audit and legal transactional costs in general resulting from the increase in net sales 
these increases were offset by a decline in the amortization costs as the company implemented new accounting standards relating to the amortization of goodwill 
general and administrative costs increased approximately to million in fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year as a percent of sales  general and administrative expenses were and of net sales for fiscal year and  respectively 
the increases in both the dollars and the percentage of sales relate to higher costs of personnel  higher professional fees as a result of higher legal and audit related fees due to the resignation of the chief financial officer in fiscal year  higher health and other insurance costs related to higher claims in the company s self funded health insurance program and a one time increase in the value of life insurance policies during fiscal year these increased costs were offset by the decline in bonuses paid to the executive management of the company 
for fiscal year no bonuses were earned by executive management 
product design and development expenses 
product design and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  other employee related costs  and facilities and equipment related costs and supplies 
product development expenses decreased approximately to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year as a percent of sales  product development expenses were and of net sales for fiscal year and respectively 
generally  product design and development expenses increase during times when the company s engineering resources do not have to be more dedicated to long term contracts  as the same personnel who work on research and development also work on long term contracts 
as a result of the impact of higher sales  consuming more the costs of labor and overhead of the engineering departments  product development costs declined in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year in addition costs were higher as the company spent more time on product development due to the lower than anticipated net sales and the resulting lack of work on long term contracts required by the product development staff 
the company also experienced an overall reduction in product development infrastructure  including lower personnel costs  lower travel and entertainment costs  and lower product management costs 
for the future  the company expects product design and development expenses to be approximately of net sales 
product development expenses increased approximately to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year as a percent of sales  product development expenses were and of net sales for fiscal year and  respectively 
when the expected levels of net sales did not materialize as expected in fiscal year  more time was spent on research and development 
included in these higher costs were increased costs of personnel and related costs  supplies and other related items 
during the year  the company made significant enhancements as a result of these higher costs which are expected to benefit future years net sales 
interest income the company occasionally sells products on an installment basis or in exchange for the rights to sell and retain advertising revenues from the scoreboard or display  both of which result in long term receivables that generate interest income 
it also invests excess cash in short term temporary cash investments that generate interest income 
interest income resulting from these long term receivables and temporary cash investments declined to million for fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year interest income was approximately and of net sales for fiscal year and respectively 
the company believes that the levels of interest income could increase in the future as it seeks to assist customers more actively in financing purchases of equipment assuming it can do so with acceptable levels of credit risk and interest rates 
interest income resulting primarily from long term receivables was million for both fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
interest income was approximately and of net sales for fiscal year and  respectively 
interest expense the company has various amounts of debt outstanding  primarily on term loans as well as available lines of credit  both of which result in interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million as compared to million in fiscal year the decline was the result of lower overall levels of debt outstanding under term loans and the reduction in amounts outstanding under the company s line of credit 
the company expects that it will be able to reduce debt further in fiscal year  reducing interest expense 
this expectation could change in the event the company is able to make strategic investments in the future 
interest expense for fiscal year decreased in fiscal year to million as compared to million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily the result of lower average interest rates paid on the debt as rates declined over the year 
this decrease was however offset by higher average levels of debt over the year 
income taxes income taxes increased to million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year this increase was principally due to the higher net income on a pre tax basis 
the effective rate of for fiscal year compares to in fiscal year the company expects that the effective income tax rate will approximate the same level in fiscal year the key items reconciling the effective income tax rate to the statutory rates are contained in the financial statements included in this report 
income taxes decreased to million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the decline was due principally to the lower net income before taxes 
the effective income tax rate was and for the fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in the effective rate was primarily the result of higher state income tax expense

cash provided by operations for fiscal year was million 
net income of million plus depreciation and amortization of approximately million  and increases in accounts payable  income taxes payable  decreases in inventory and in the net amount of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts and various other changes in operating assets and liabilities were offset by increases in accounts receivables  and long term receivables

the company has used and expects to continue to use cash reserves and bank borrowings to meet its short term working capital requirements 
on large product orders  the time between order acceptance and project completion may extend up to and exceed months depending on the amount of custom work and the customer s delivery needs 
the company often receives a down payment or progress payments on these product orders 
to the extent that these payments are not sufficient to fund the costs and other expenses associated with these orders  the company uses working capital and bank borrowings to finance these cash requirements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rates through may  substantially all of the company s net sales were denominated in united states dollars  and its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate changes has been immaterial 
net sales originating outside the united states for fiscal year were of total net sales 
it is expected that in the future net sales to international markets may increase as a percentage of net sales and the company expects that a portion of this increase may be denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  operating results may become subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of certain currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
to the extent that the company engages in international sales denominated in united states dollars  an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make the company s products less competitive in international markets 
although the company will continue to monitor and minimize its exposure to currency fluctuations  and  when appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing economic conditions  changes in political climates  differing tax structures and other rules and regulations could adversely affect the company s financial results in the future

each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have an insignificant annual effect on variable rate debt interest based on the balances of such debt as of as of may  for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affects its fair market value  but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
in connection with the sale of certain video displays  scoreboards and message display centers  the company has entered into various types of financing orders 
the aggregate amounts due from customers include an imputed interest element 
the majority of these financings carry fixed rates of interest 
as of may   the company s outstanding long term receivables were approximately million 
each basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated annual opportunity cost of approximately million
