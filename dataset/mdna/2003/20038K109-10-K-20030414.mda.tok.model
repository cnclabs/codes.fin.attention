recent developments the following is a discussion of certain developments that have occurred since the beginning of the company s fiscal year 
this discussion is not intended to be an exhaustive discussion of all material events that have occurred during this period 
amendments to credit facility in may  the company entered into amendment no 
to its credit facility agented by whitehall business credit corporation  formerly ibj whitehall business credit corporation the whitehall credit facility to  among other things i waive the company s non compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio for the period ended march   ii reduce the fixed charge coverage ratio in future periods  and iii increase each level of the applicable rate and libor margins by 
in december  the company entered into amendment no 
to the whitehall credit facility to i extend the maturity date of the facility from december  to august   ii authorize the exchange transactions with the fanning partnership described under recent developments retirement of pik debentures in this item  iii reduce the maximum borrowing availability from million to million to eliminate borrowing availability the company has not previously required  and iv further reduce the fixed charge coverage ratio in future periods 
retirement of pik debentures in february  the company issued million face amount of its new series a preferred stock having a fair market value of million in exchange for million of its outstanding pik debentures including accrued interest from a related party and repurchased additional pik debentures  including interest from unrelated parties for a cash payment of  as a result of this transaction  the company will recognize a gain on debt extinguishment of approximately million  which includes the reduction of approximately  of deferred financing costs  in the first quarter of virtually all of the pik debentures were retired in february  and the company intends to redeem or repurchase the remaining pik debentures having a face amount of less than  before the next interest payment date 
shares of the series a preferred stock were issued to the fanning partnership  a limited partnership in which john fanning  the company s chairman and chief executive officer  holds the principal economic interest 
rosemary maniscalco  a director of the company  is the general partner of the fanning partnership 
by virtue of this position  she is deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares of series a preferred stock issued 
the purpose of this transaction was to improve the company s balance sheet through the elimination of million of high interest rate debt per annum  principally through the issuance of equity securities 
the company s offer to exchange pik debentures for series a preferred stock was extended to all holders of the pik debentures that remained outstanding 
no other holder of pik debentures accepted the company s offer of exchange for series a preferred stock  however  some elected instead to tender their pik debentures to the company for repurchase at a substantial discount 
the company obtained the opinion of an independent investment banking firm that the terms of the exchange transaction with the fanning partnership were fair to the company from a financial point of view  and the company s independent directors approved the terms of the transaction 
see recent sales of unregistered securities in item for a description of the rights and preferences of the series a preferred stock 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion in this item addresses the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
a discussion of the more significant estimates follows 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of the board of directors 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company has an allowance for doubtful accounts recorded as an estimate of the accounts receivable balance that may not be collected 
this allowance is calculated on the trade receivables with consideration for the company s historical write off experience  the current aging of receivables  general economic climate and the financial condition of the customer 
after giving due consideration to these factors  the company establishes specific allowances for bad debt 
the allowance for the funding and service fee receivable is calculated with consideration for the ability of the company s clients to absorb chargebacks due to the uncollectibility of the funded receivables 
bad debt expense  which increases the allowance for doubtful accounts  is recorded as an operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
factors that would cause this provision to increase primarily relate to increased bankruptcies by customers  the inability of the companies funding services clients to absorb chargebacks and other difficulties collecting amounts billed 
on the other hand  an improved write off experience and aging of receivables would result in a decrease to the provision 
reserves for workers compensation the company records its estimate of the ultimate cost of  and reserves for  workers compensation based on actuarial computations using the company s loss history as well as industry statistics 
furthermore  in determining its reserves  the company includes reserves for estimated claims incurred but not reported 
the ultimate cost of workers compensation will depend on actual costs incurred to settle the claims and may differ from the amounts reserved by the company for those claims 
accruals for workers compensation claims are included in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets 
a significant increase in claims or changes in laws may require the company to record additional expenses related to workers compensation 
on the other hand  significantly improved claim experience may result in lower annual expense levels 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company records a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for which utilization of the asset is not likely 
management s judgment is required in determining the realizability of the deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowances recorded 
the net deferred tax assets may need to be adjusted in the event that tax rates are modified  or management s estimates of future taxable income change  such that deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled at a different tax rate than currently estimated 
in addition  valuation allowances may need to be adjusted in the event that management s estimate of future taxable income changes from the amounts currently estimated 
the company provides for income taxes on a quarterly basis on an estimated annual tax rate 
in determining this rate  management makes estimates about taxable income in each of the states where the company operates  as well as the tax rate that will be in effect for each state 
to the extent these estimates change during the year  or that actual results differ from these estimates  the estimated annual tax rate may change between quarterly periods and may differ from the actual effective tax rate for the year 
goodwill impairment the company tested goodwill for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas as of the beginning and end of fiscal year in connection with the goodwill tests  the company engaged an independent firm to assist management in the determination of the fair values of its reporting units as defined by sfas 
in its determination of the fair values  the firm engaged by the company primarily utilized a discounted cash flow analysis as well as various other valuation approaches  including a recent values paid by investors and purchasers of companies in businesses similar to that of the company  b capitalization multiples of companies with investment characteristics resembling those of the reporting units  c the enterprise value of the company  and d asset and liability structure 
significant assumptions used in this analysis include i expected future revenue growth rates  operating unit profit margins  and working capital levels  ii a discount rate  and iii a terminal value multiple 
the revenue growth rates  working capital levels and operating unit profit margins are based on management s expectation of future results 
as previously discussed  the company s operating results  including those of its more specialized operations  have been negatively impacted by the general economic conditions 
based on management s assessment of the circumstances and considering the firm s findings  the company recognized an impairment loss of million net of taxes as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle during the first quarter of in the fourth quarter of  the company  again utilizing this independent firm in testing for goodwill impairment  recognized an additional impairment loss of million due to the company s failure to meet previous growth expectations 
these impairment losses relate primarily to the goodwill attributable to staffing companies acquired by the company in and  during which time staffing companies were customarily valued using higher multiples 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
if management s expectations of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of the company s reporting units could change significantly 
such a change could result in additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

these costs were further reduced by lower commissions as a result of the decrease of sales discussed above 
operating loss for the year ended december  was million as compared to operating income of million for the year ended december  this operating loss for the year ended december  is principally attributable to the company s fourth quarter million write off related to the impairment of goodwill discussed above and a decrease in sales and gross margins in staff augmentation and financial outsourcing services segments  partially offset by a reduction of million in goodwill amortization due to the adoption of sfas as well as the more favorable workers compensation history for fiscal discussed above 
the company s interest expense for the year ended december  and december  is attributable to the whitehall credit facility  the convertible notes  the senior notes and the pik debentures

the company suffered a decrease in net sales of services in each of its three segments 
in the staff augmentation segment  the decrease is principally attributable to a sharp decline in the telecom industry resulting in lower sales to telecom customers  partially offset by higher sales to information technology customers 
also  due to the continuing effects of the economic recession  sales were lower in both the human capital management services and financial outsourcing services segments 
cost of services for the year ended december  was of net sales of services as compared to cost of services of for the year ended december  the cost of services as a percentage of net sales for increased from levels principally as a result of lower sales and gross margin percentages on sales to telecom customers and a decrease in permanent placement fees  partially offset by the company s continued focus on higher margin niche products in the staff augmentation segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales of services were for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this increase is principally a result of a million write off in the fourth quarter of relating to uncollectible funding and service fees receivable  and higher payroll and recruiting costs with respect to non billable staff and investments to expand the infrastructure for the company s human capital management services segment during the first half of  offset partially by initiatives made by management during the second half of to reduce costs

invoices are generated to reflect these costs plus the company s markup 
these bills are typically paid within days 
increases in the company s net sales of services  resulting from expansion of existing offices or establishment of new offices  will require additional cash resources 
the following table represents contractual commitments associated with operating agreements payments due by period thereafter in thousands operating leases whitehall credit facility principal repayments senior notes principal repayments pik debentures principal repayments convertible notes principal repayments total the company was obligated under various agreements to make earn out payments to the sellers of companies acquired by the company and to sellers of franchised businesses repurchased by the company  subject to the sellers meeting specified contractual requirements

as of december   the company had outstanding million principal amount under the whitehall credit facility bearing interest at a weighted average rate of per annum 
in addition  as of december   the company had outstanding million principal amount of pik debentures bearing interest at a rate of per annum virtually all of which were subsequently retired  as described in this item under recent developments retirement of pik debentures  million principal amount of senior notes bearing interest at a rate of per annum and million principal amount of convertible notes bearing interest at the rate of per annum 
as more fully described below  interest on the convertible notes may be satisfied through the issuance of new convertible notes through december  through the last interest payment date on december   the company elected to issue new convertible notes to pay interest due thereon and expects to continue to do so through december  the company entered into the whitehall credit facility in december to provide greater borrowing availability and flexibility 
the whitehall credit facility has been amended several times since it was entered into  including to ensure the company s compliance with financial covenants at march  and subsequent periods as described in this item under recent developments amendments to credit facility  and to lessen the financial requirements through december the whitehall credit facility  as amended  has permitted the company to execute its strategy of reducing its higher interest rate debt and improving its balance sheet by retiring senior notes and pik debentures 
in the most recent amendment  the maturity date was extended from december  to august  the whitehall credit facility currently provides for borrowing availability of up to million based upon a specified percentage of the company s eligible accounts receivable 
at year end  the company had remaining availability based upon then outstanding eligible accounts receivable of million 
substantially all of the consolidated net assets of the company are assets of coi and all of the net income that had been generated by the company was attributable to the operations of coi 
except for permitted distributions  these assets and any cumulated net income are restricted as to their use by comforce 
the indenture governing the senior notes imposes restrictions on coi making specified payments  which are referred to as restricted payments  including making distributions or paying dividends referred to as upstreaming funds to comforce 
under the indenture  coi is not permitted to make cash distributions to comforce other than to upstream million annually to pay public company expenses  to upstream up to million to pay income tax related to deemed forgiveness of pik debentures to facilitate the purchase or exchange by comforce of pik debentures at less than par  under certain circumstances in connection with a disposition of assets  to upstream proceeds therefrom to repay the pik debentures  and to upstream funds to the extent coi meets the restricted payments test under the indenture  the most significant component of which is based upon a percentage of net income generated by coi since january  on a cumulative basis  less prior distributions made in reliance on this provision 
management believes that million annually if coi has funds available for this purpose will be sufficient to pay comforce s annual public company expenses for the foreseeable future 
principally as a result of losses incurred by coi in fiscal and prior distributions made by coi to comforce  coi can make no distributions to comforce based upon the cumulative net income provisions of the indenture 
it is anticipated that coi must generate net income of approximately  before it will be able to upstream funds to comforce under the restrictive payments test of the indenture 
through december   interest under the pik debentures was payable  at the option of comforce  in cash or in kind through the issuance of additional pik debentures 
in addition  through december   interest on the convertible notes is payable  at the option of comforce  in cash or in kind through the issuance of additional convertible notes 
to date  comforce has paid all interest under the pik debentures and convertible notes in kind 
virtually all of the pik debentures were retired in february  and the company intends to redeem or repurchase the remaining pik debentures having a face amount of less than  before the next interest payment date 
beginning with the interest payment due june   comforce will be required to pay interest on the convertible notes in cash 
its ability to do so is expected to be dependent on its availability of funds for this purpose  whether through borrowings by coi under the whitehall credit facility  funds from coi s operations or otherwise  and on coi s ability to upstream funds in accordance with the restricted payments test under the indenture for the senior notes 
comforce s ability to repay convertible notes at their maturity on december   or on any earlier required repayment or repurchase dates  will also be dependent on any restrictions under its loan agreements as then in effect and availability of funds 
under the indenture  coi is subject to restrictions in upstreaming funds to its parent comforce 
the company does not currently have sufficient availability under the indenture to make a cash payment of semi annual interest under the convertible notes 
management anticipates that the company will need to be profitable in and the first quarter of in order to have adequate funds eligible for upstreaming to comforce to pay cash interest that will first become due under the convertible notes on june  if the company does not have adequate availability under the indenture to upstream funds to pay interest on the convertible notes  the company expects to request the holder of the convertible notes  which is a partnership in which john fanning  the company s chairman and chief executive officer  holds the principal economic interest  to consider alternative arrangements 
such arrangements could include exchanging the notes for preferred stock or extending payment in kind interest provisions 
the convertible notes are convertible into the company s common stock based on a price of per share of common stock  provided that if such conversion would result in a change of control occurring under the terms of the indentures governing the pik debentures or the senior notes  the convertible note will be convertible into shares of non voting participating preferred stock having a nominal liquidation preference but no other preferences  which in turn will be convertible into common stock at the holder s option at any time so long as the conversion would not result in a change of control 
notice of conversion must be given at least days in advance 
as of december   approximately million  or  of the company s total assets were goodwill recorded in connection with the company s acquisitions 
effective at the beginning of fiscal  the company ceased recording amortization expense relating to goodwill amounting to approximately million annually upon its required adoption of a new accounting standard sfas 
the company evaluated the recoverability of goodwill on its books under the new standards under sfas at its adoption in the first quarter of  resulting in its write off of million of goodwill in that quarter  and again in the fourth quarter of  resulting in an additional write off of million of goodwill in that quarter 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of sfas and the company s methodology in determining these write offs for impairment of goodwill 
if management s expectations of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of the company s reporting units could change significantly 
such a change could result in additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
management of the company believes that cash flow from operations and funds anticipated to be available under the whitehall credit facility will be sufficient to service the company s indebtedness and to meet currently anticipated working capital requirements throughout although the company has made significant progress in improving its capital structure  most recently through the elimination of debt in connection with the transactions completed in february  as described under recent sales of unregistered securities in item  management has initiated discussions with financial institutions to explore additional strategies to further eliminate high interest rate debt 
the company is currently undergoing an income tax audit by the internal revenue service for the fiscal year the results under this audit are not yet known 
in april  the company discussed with the staff of the securities and exchange commission a question previously raised by the staff in a comment letter to the company relating to the gross versus net display of revenues from the company s licensed offices 
the commission staff did not agree with the position taken by the company  but agreed to consider additional factual information which the company believes supports this position 
the company believes that its position is appropriate and intends to seek to convince the commission staff of the merits of the position 
if  however  the commission staff ultimately declines to accept the company s position  the company believes that any additional changes recommended by the staff in connection with this item will reduce revenue for fiscal by less than and will have no impact on the company s net loss for fiscal impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued statement no

forward looking statements various statements made in this report concerning the manner in which the company intends to conduct its future operations  and potential trends that may impact future results of operations  are forward looking statements 
the company may be unable to realize its plans and objectives due to various important factors  including  but not limited to the following a continuation of the current recessionary environment  particularly in the aircraft manufacturing  telecom  information technology and other sectors served by the company which may reflect cyclical conditions or  particularly in the case of telecom  fundamental changes in these industries  could further reduce demand for contingent personnel and further heighten the competition for customers  resulting in lower revenues and margins and affecting the company s ability to continue to meet the financial covenants under the whitehall credit facility  the company s significant leverage may leave it with a diminished ability to obtain additional financing for working capital or other capital expenditures  for retiring higher interest rate debt or for otherwise improving the company s competitiveness and capital structure or expanding its operations  sfas  which requires the company to evaluate at least annually the recoverability of goodwill on its books  could cause the company to write off goodwill in future periods in addition to the write offs of million in  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations  or  if coi fails to generate sufficient consolidated net income after covering its cumulative deficit at december  of  or to have other funds available to upstream to comforce under the restricted payments test of the senior notes indenture in order for it to pay cash interest on the convertible notes which is required beginning on june  or to repay the convertible notes at their maturity on december   or on any earlier required repayment or repurchase date  then  unless comforce obtains a loan or sells its capital stock or other securities to provide funds for this purpose  the company will default under the indenture governing the senior notes and under the whitehall credit facility 
additional important factors that could cause the company to be unable to realize its plans and objectives are described under risk factors in the registration statement on form s of the company filed with the securities and exchange commission on december  registration no 

the disclosure under risk factors in the registration statement may be accessed through the web site maintained by the securities and exchange commission at www 
sec 
gov 
in addition  the company will provide  without charge  a copy of such risk factors disclosure to each stockholder of the company who requests such information 
requests for copies should be directed to the attention of linda annicelli  vice president  administration at comforce corporation  crossways park drive  po box  woodbury  new york  telephone item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk most of the company s borrowings are fixed rate obligations  including million principal amount of senior notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of per annum  million principal amount of convertible notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of per annum  and million principal amount of pik debentures bearing interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
the estimated fair value of these debt obligations at december  was million for the senior notes  million for the convertible notes and million for the pik debentures 
management of the company does not believe that a increase in interest rates would have a material impact to the fair value of these fixed rate obligations 
borrowings under the whitehall credit facility aggregating million at december  are at variable interest rates and interest expense will be impacted by changes in interest rates generally prevailing in the united states and internationally 
assuming an immediate increase in the weighted average interest rate of  the impact to the company in annualized interest payable would be approximately  accordingly  the company has not entered into any swap agreements or other hedging transactions as a means of limiting exposure to interest rate fluctuations
