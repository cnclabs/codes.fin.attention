item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general the following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of pab should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes  and is qualified in its entirety by the foregoing and other more detailed financial information appearing elsewhere 
historical results of operations and the percentage relationships among any amounts included  and any trends which may appear to be inferred  should not be taken as being necessarily indicative of trends in operations or results of operations for any future periods 
we have made  and will continue to make  various forward looking statements with respect to financial and business matters 
comments regarding our business which are not historical facts are considered forward looking statements that involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements 
for additional information regarding our cautionary disclosures  see the cautionary notice regarding forward looking statements at the beginning of this report 
statistical disclosures distribution of assets  liabilities and stockholders equity  interest rates and interest differential on may   the board of directors adopted a resolution requested by our primary federal regulator  the federal reserve bank of atlanta  which  among other things  restricts us from redeeming our capital stock  paying dividends  modifying existing debt agreements  or incurring additional debt without the prior approval of our banking regulators 
the resolution is the result of a recent examination that found the bank to be in less than satisfactory condition due primarily to serious weaknesses identified in the asset quality of the bank s loan portfolio 
this resolution had a profound impact on our financial condition and results of operations in  and it shall remain in effect until removed by the regulators 
the company s balance sheet has been in a period of contraction since the end of at december   our total assets were million  a million  or  decrease from total assets of million at december  the majority of the decrease in assets was in the loan portfolio 
total loans decreased million  or  in total deposits decreased million  or  in of those decreases  million in loans and million in deposits were sold with our richmond hill branch office in january overall  our residential mortgage loan portfolio is down million  or  since the beginning of due primarily to the high level of mortgage refinancing activity 
our consumer loans are down million  or  for the year 
loans for commercial purposes including commercial real estate and construction and development loans are down million  or 
the decline in consumer and commercial loans during is primarily the result of the following factors some of our markets have been in an economic recession and there has been a corresponding slow down in loan demand  new loan growth in our south georgia markets has been hampered by our internal focus on improving asset quality  high turnover in senior lenders  and the adoption of a more conservative underwriting philosophy  payoffs of some large out of market participation loans were not replaced  general portfolio decay resulting from customer reaction to the consolidation of our banking charters  and net charge offs of million in those categories for the year 
loan growth has been positive in our new markets in metro atlanta  but not at a pace to replenish the contraction in some of our south georgia markets 
without any net new loans driving asset growth in  we have reduced the liability side of our balance sheet by allowing time deposits to either roll off the balance sheet or into other deposit accounts at maturity 
time deposits have declined by a net million  or  since the beginning of at the same time  we have continued to focus on building customer relationships and seeking core deposits 
balances in demand and savings accounts increased million  or  during in addition  we reduced our advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta by a net million  or  during total stockholders equity increased million  or  during equity was increased primarily from the contribution of million from earnings net of million in dividends paid prior to the adoption of the resolution previously mentioned 
as a percentage of total assets  equity represented at end of  compared to at the beginning of  with the increase resulting from an increase in equity and a decline in assets during the year 
interest rates remained at near historic lows throughout most of while the lower rate environment resulted in downward repricing of our earning assets  we were also able to reduce the cost of funding those earning assets during the year 
the next two tables illustrate the effects of the decline in interest rates and a decrease in the volume of loans and other earning assets on our interest income during the impact of interest rates and volume on our earnings are more fully discussed under results of operations below

the change in interest attributable to rate has been determined by applying the change in rate between years to average balances outstanding in the later year 
the change in interest due to volume has been determined by applying the rate from the earlier year to the change in average balances outstanding between years

the maturities presented for mortgage backed securities are based on the average lives of those bonds at the then projected prepayment speeds

three of the four borrowers  whose debts with the bank total million  are farmers whose loans are secured by farmland and agricultural equipment 
the other borrower owes the bank million on a real estate and golf course development 
in december  we took a million write down on this line due to a potential collateral deficiency 
included in nonperforming loans at the beginning of  were loans totaling million due from one commercial borrower 
these loans were partially guaranteed by the u 
s 
department of agriculture the usda 
we wrote off the unguaranteed portions of these loans in december when it became apparent the borrower could no longer adequately service the debt 
in september  after an unsuccessful effort to collect the loans from the borrower  the remaining balance of these loans were charged off and a formal claim was filed with the usda for a recovery of the guaranteed portion plus uncollected interest and legal and collection fees 
our claim is currently under review at the usda  and at this time  we can provide no assurances as to the timing or amount of a recovery  if any 
although we have made some progress in addressing our nonperforming loans  we still have a challenge ahead of us as we work to bring our level of nonperforming loans to a more acceptable level 
our ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was at year end  compared to an average ratio of for our national peer group all commercial banks having assets between million and billion 
unfortunately  with a slowing economy we would expect to see additional problems develop in both consumer and commercial loans in the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when  in our judgment  the borrower may be unable to meet payments as they become due  unless the loan is well secured 
all interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status is reversed against interest income 
interest income on nonaccrual loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received unless and until the loan is returned to accrual status 
for the year ended december   the gross interest income that would have been recorded if our nonperforming loans had been current in accordance with their original terms was approximately million 
the amount of interest income on the above nonperforming loans that was included in net income for the year ended december  was approximately  a potential problem loan is any loan which is not disclosed above as nonperforming  but where known information about possible credit problems of the borrower causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrower to comply with the present loan repayment terms 
as of december   there were approximately  in loans not classified as nonperforming that management considered potential problem loans 
summary of loan loss experience analysis of the allowance for loan losses the following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for loan losses  the average balance of loans outstanding  and the ratio of net losses experienced for each of the last five years

our level of charge offs has increased substantially in and compared to the previous years due primarily to million in write downs taken on two larger credits 
at december   the allowance as a percent of total loans was  compared to at december  we consider the current level of the allowance for loan losses adequate to absorb losses from loans in the portfolio 
we have a comprehensive methodology for determining the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
this methodology includes an assessment for specific valuations on larger loan lines and nonperforming loans  and an assessment based on environmental factors applied to other smaller homogenous groups of otherwise performing loans 
the environmental factors considered in developing our loss measurements include levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans  levels of and trends in charge offs and recoveries  trends in volume and terms of loans  effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards and other changes in lending policies  procedures  and practices  experience  ability  and depth of lending management and other relevant staff  national and local economic trends and conditions  industry conditions  and effects of changes in credit concentrations 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
while we use the best information available to make the evaluation  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if there are significant changes in economic conditions or other environmental factors 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses  and may require the bank to make additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses we have allocated the allowance for credit losses according to the amount deemed to be reasonably necessary at each year end to provide for the possibility of losses being incurred within the categories of loans set forth in the table below 
the allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any other category 
the components of the allowance for credit losses for each of the past five years are presented below

within our portfolio of time deposits  those with balances of  or more decreased by million  or  during the year 
other time deposits also declined as we lowered our offering rates during the year and depositors moved into interest bearing demand and savings accounts 
along with the decrease in volume  the average rate paid on time deposits dropped basis points from in to in the decrease in both volume and rate on these deposits allowed us to improve our net interest margin and keep our net interest income from falling to a less profitable level 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is an important factor in our financial condition and affects our ability to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers 
assets  consisting primarily of loans and investment securities  are funded by customer deposits  borrowed funds  and retained earnings 
maturities in the investment and loan portfolios also provide a steady flow of funds for reinvestment 
in addition  our liquidity continues to be enhanced by a relatively stable core deposit base and the availability of additional funding sources 
at december   our liquidity ratio was and our net noncore funding dependency ratio was 
our liquidity and funding policy provides that we should maintain a liquidity position of greater than or equal to and a net noncore funding dependency ratio of less than or equal to 
although we intend to tighten our liquidity levels in early  since year end we are aware of no trends or events likely to result in a material change in our ability to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers 
borrowings we will often utilize external funding sources to fund growth and operations 
we utilize deposits  federal funds lines of credit with our correspondent banks  and customer repurchase agreements to provide liquidity and short term funding  while long term funding needs are often met through advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta the fhlb and other borrowing arrangements 
our fhlb advances outstanding averaged million during the advances outstanding at december  totaled million with a weighted average stated interest rate of 
on november   pab bankshares capital trust i pab trust issued million of floating rate capital securities  also referred to as trust preferred securities 
we formed pab trust  a statutory business trust created under the laws of the state of delaware  for the sole purpose of issuing the trust preferred securities and investing the proceeds in floating rate junior subordinated debentures issued by us 
the interest rates on both the trust preferred securities and the debentures are reset semi annually at libor plus currently with a rate cap of through december  we entered into agreements which  taken collectively  fully  irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee  on a subordinated basis  all of pab trust s obligations under the trust preferred securities 
pab trust s sole asset is the debentures issued by us 
the debentures will mature on december   but are callable at par at our option in whole or in part anytime after december  the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities qualify as tier capital under the risk based capital guidelines established by the federal reserve 
investment portfolio the bank s investment portfolio is another primary source of liquidity 
maturities of securities provide a constant flow of funds that are available for cash needs 
contractual investment securities that mature within one year total million 
however  mortgage backed securities and securities with call provisions create cash flows earlier than the contractual maturities 
estimates of prepayments on mortgage backed securities and call provisions on federal agency and state and municipals increase the forecasted cash flows from the investment portfolio 
our liquidity from investments is somewhat limited since we pledge certain investments to secure public deposits  certain borrowing arrangements  and for other purposes 
at december   approximately of our million investment portfolio was pledged as collateral to others 
commitments of capital our financial statements do not reflect various commitments and contingent liabilities that arise in the normal course of business 
these off balance sheet financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
these financial instruments are included in the financial statements when funds are distributed or the instruments become payable 
we use the same credit policies in making commitments as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and credit card commitments is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
at december   we had outstanding commitments to extend credit through open lines of credit of approximately million and outstanding standby letters of credit of approximately million 
at december   we had an outstanding commitment to complete the construction of a branch office in hall county  georgia 
our plan is to fund the remaining  estimated for final construction costs and to furnish and equip this office during the first quarter of with cash provided from operations 
our cash flow from operations for the past three years has ranged between and million per year 
there are no other binding commitments for material cash expenditures outstanding 
stockholders equity we are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by our regulatory agencies 
see the section titled capital adequacy under supervision and regulation in item of this document for more information on the regulatory capital adequacy standards 
the following table summarizes our consolidated regulatory capital ratios at december   and minimum regulatory requirement total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to average assets leverage ratio results of operations net interest income the primary component of a financial institution s profitability is net interest income  or the difference between the interest income earned on assets  primarily loans and investments  and interest paid on liabilities  primarily deposits and other borrowed funds 
our net interest income for  on a tax equivalent basis  increased by million  or  over interest income decreased million  or  while interest expense decreased by million  or  during the decrease in interest income is primarily the result of a million  or  decrease in the volume of average earning assets held in compared to in addition  due to the low interest rate environment  the average yield on those earning assets fell basis points from in to in the decrease in interest expense is also the result of a decline in volume and rates 
average interest bearing liabilities decreased by million  or  during  and the average rates paid on those funds decreased basis points from in to in net interest income for decreased by million  or  from the decrease in from was the net result of a rapid decrease in interest rates during offset somewhat by an increase in volume over the repricing of our fixed rate time deposits and other borrowings lagged nine to twelve months on average behind the almost instantaneous repricing of the bulk of our loans during the net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
our net interest margin increased from in to in  a basis point improvement 
although our net interest margin steadily improved each quarter during  from during the fourth quarter of to during the fourth quarter of  our ability to continue to improve our net interest margin going forward will be a challenge as long as interest rates hold at or slide even lower than the current levels 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the charge to operating earnings necessary to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses 
through the provision  we maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
however  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and other internal and external environmental factors 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination procedures  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination  such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was million in this is a decline of million from the decline is due to a shrinking loan portfolio and some stabilization in the level of nonperforming loans 
the provision for loan losses increased to million in from million in due primarily to a million provision required by the examiners for the federal reserve 
the increased provisions in were necessary to cover the rise in nonperforming loans  to keep pace with an increase in charge offs  and to reserve for other weaknesses identified in the loan portfolio

the fee income generated from an overdraft privilege product that was launched in march and resulted in an increase in revenues that year also tapered off in mortgage origination fees increased in due to a rise in refinancing activity as interest rates remained low during the year 
if the demand for refinancing slows during  we expect our mortgage origination fee income to decline as well 
brokerage income increased in to  during the third year of that operation 
we do not expect to be able to generate as much income in as retail investing activity has slowed 
fee income from atm and debit cards increased in as the volume of point of sale transactions has increased and  to a lesser degree  we increased the fees we charge non bank customers for the use of our atm s during the year

this resulted in a decrease in goodwill amortization cost of  from legal and accounting fees increased by in the majority of this increase can be attributed to an increase in legal fees for the collection and recovery of problem loans 
both legal and accounting fees also increased due to regulatory matters 
telephone  postage and courier costs all increased as we have geographically expanded our offices further away from our headquarters in valdosta over the past two years 
most other operating expenses were down in as a result of a tighter budgeting process  the consolidation of our banking charters  and other cost savings measures

we cope with the effects of inflation through managing our interest rate sensitivity gap position  by periodically reviewing and adjusting our pricing of services to consider current costs  and through managing our dividend payout policy relative to our level of income 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and the related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates and assumptions which effect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that our determination of the allowance for loan losses and the fair value of assets  including the impairment of goodwill  affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the company s accounting policies are described in detail in note of our consolidated financial statements provided in item of this report 
the following is a brief description of the company s critical accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgment 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the allowance for loan losses is determined based on management s assessment of several factors including  but not limited to  reviews and evaluations of specific loans  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and the related impact on segments of the loan portfolio  historical loan loss experiences and the level of classified and nonperforming loans 
loans are considered impaired if  based on current information and events  it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impaired loans is based on either the fair value of the underlying collateral  the present value of the future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  or the estimated market value of the loan 
in measuring the fair value of the collateral  management uses assumptions eg  discount rate and methodologies eg  comparison to the recent selling price of similar assets consistent with those that would be utilized by unrelated third parties 
management s assessment is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  economic conditions  historical loss experience  or the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
should cash flow assumptions or market conditions change  a different amount may be reported for the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
estimates of fair value the estimation of fair value is significant to a number of the company s assets  including  but not limited to  investment securities  other real estate owned  and other repossessed assets 
these are all recorded at either fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value 
fair values are volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors 
circumstances that could cause estimates of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities to change include a change in prepayment speeds  discount rates  or market interest rates 
our estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
fair values for most investment securities are based on quoted market prices 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on the quoted prices of similar instruments 
the fair values of other real estate owned are typically determined based on appraisals by third parties  less estimated costs to sell 
estimates of fair value are also required in performing an impairment analysis of goodwill 
the company reviews goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
an impairment would be indicated if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit 
recent accounting pronouncements in management s opinion  there are no recent accounting pronouncements that have had a material impact on pab s earnings or financial position as of or for the year ended december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to exposure from us dollar interest rate changes and accordingly  we manage our exposure by considering the possible changes in the net interest margin 
we do not engage in trading activity nor do we classify any portion of the investment portfolio as held for trading 
we do not engage in any hedging activities or enter into any derivative instruments with a higher degree of risk than mortgage backed securities  which are commonly held pass through securities 
finally  we have no material direct exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  and other market risks 
interest rates play a major part in the net interest income of a financial institution 
the sensitivity to rate changes is known as interest rate risk 
the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can influence the changes in net interest income 
as part of our asset liability management program  the timing of repriced assets and liabilities is referred to as gap management 
it is our policy to maintain a gap ratio in the one year time horizon between and 
however  with interest rates at historic lows and the shape of the interest rate curve  the company has exceeded policy limits by adjusting the balance sheet to a more asset sensitive position 
at december   our one year management adjusted gap ratio of was outside of our policy guidelines  however  this exception to policy was mitigated by our strategy to position our balance sheet to benefit from an increase in interest rates 
also  our assumptions on prepayments speeds  based in part on the mortgage bankers association s refinancing index that reached record high levels during  may or may not be sustainable throughout the next year 
the table below has two measures of gap  regulatory and management adjusted 
the regulatory gap considers only contractual maturities or repricings 
the management adjusted gap includes assumptions regarding prepayment speeds on certain rate sensitive assets  the repricing frequency of interest bearing demand and savings accounts  and the stability of core deposit levels  all of which are adjusted periodically as market conditions change 
the management adjusted gap indicates we are highly asset sensitive in relation to changes in market interest rates in the short term 
being asset sensitive would result in net interest income increasing in a rising rate environment and decreasing in a declining rate environment

the simulation of rising  declining  and flat interest rate scenarios allows us to monitor and adjust interest rate sensitivity to minimize the impact of market interest rate swings 
the analysis of the impact on net interest income over a twelve month period is subjected to increases or decreases in market rates on net interest income and is monitored on a quarterly basis 
as of year end  the simulation model projected net interest income would increase over the next year if market rates immediately rose by basis points 
on the other hand  the model projected net interest income to decrease over the next year if market rates immediately fell by basis points 
the high volatility in our results is due primarily to our asset sensitive balance sheet mix and our behavioral assumptions for repricing and prepayment speeds 
our policy states that net interest income cannot be reduced by more than using this analysis  and technically  we were outside of policy guidelines at year end 
however  this exception was mitigated because a further basis point drop was not realistic given that the federal funds rate stood at 
if market rates immediately fell by basis points  a more plausible but still unlikely scenario  our model projected net interest income to decrease over the next year 
the following table shows the results of these projections for net interest income expressed as a percentage change over net interest income in a flat rate scenario for both a gradual change in market interest rates over a twelve month period and an immediate change  or shock  in market interest rates
