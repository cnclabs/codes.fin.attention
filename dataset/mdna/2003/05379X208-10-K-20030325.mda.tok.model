overview we develop  market and support an integrated suite of video enabled vbusiness applications  all powered by our avistarvos software 
from the desktop  we deliver tv quality interactive video calling  content creation and publishing  broadcast origination and distribution  video on demand and integrated data sharing 
our video and data collaboration applications are all managed by the avistarvos video operating system 
our customers use our system to improve productivity and communication within their enterprise and between enterprises to enhance relationships with customers  suppliers and partners 
using avistarvos software and leveraging video  telephony and internet networking standards  our applications are designed to be scalable  reliable  cost effective  easy to use and capable of evolving with communications networks as bandwidth increases and as new standards and protocols emerge 
we sell our system directly to enterprises in selected strategic vertical markets and have focused initially on the financial services and manufacturing industries 
our objective is to establish our technology as the standard for networked video 
we operate in two segments 
we engage in the design  development  manufacturing  sale and marketing of networked video communications products  and associated support services and cpi  our wholly owned subsidiary  engages in the prosecution  maintenance  support and licensing of the intellectual property that we have developed  some of which is used in our products 
as of december   cpi had not entered into any such third party licensing agreements 
in july  our board of directors and the board of directors of avistar systems  our wholly owned  approved the merger of avistar systems with and into our company 
the merger was completed in july we operate on a week fiscal year ending december our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
table of contents revenue recognition  valuation of accounts receivable  and valuation of inventories 
these critical accounting policies are discussed below 
revenue we derive product revenue principally from the sale and licensing of our video enabled networked communications system  consisting of a suite of avistar designed software and hardware products  including third party components 
in addition  we derive revenue from fees for installation  maintenance  support  training services and software development 
product revenue as a percentage of total revenue was for and for we recognize revenue from product sales when all of the following conditions are met the product has been shipped  an arrangement exists with the customer at a fixed price and we have the right to invoice the customer  collection of the receivable is probable  and we have fulfilled all of our material contractual obligations to the customer 
when we provide installation services  the product and installation revenue is recognized upon completion of installation and receipt of customer confirmation  subject to the satisfaction of the revenue recognition criteria described above 
the price charged for maintenance and or support services is stipulated in the customer contract and is based on a percentage of product revenue 
customers have the option to renew the maintenance and or support services in subsequent periods at the same rate as paid in the initial year 
revenue from maintenance and support is recognized pro rata over the maintenance and or support term  which is typically one year in length 
training services are offered independently of the purchase of product 
the value of these training services is determined based on the price charged when such services are sold separately and training revenue is recognized upon performance of the service 
we recognize service revenue from software development contracts using the percentage of completion method  when all of the following conditions are met a contract exists with the customer at a fixed price  we have fulfilled all of our material contractual obligations to the customer for a deliverable of the contract  verification of completion of the deliverable has been received  and collection of the receivable is probable 
reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred during installation and support services  which have not been significant to date  are recognized as revenue in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
to date  a significant portion of our revenue has resulted from sales to a limited number of customers  particularly deutsche bank ag and jp morgan chase company and their affiliates 
for  we recorded revenue of approximately million  or of total revenue  from these customers  each of whom generated more than of our total revenue 
for  we recorded revenue of approximately million  or of total revenue  from deutsche bank  jp morgan chase and ubs warburg llc and their affiliates  each of whom generated more than of our total revenue 
we anticipate that our revenue  and therefore  our operating results for any given period  will continue to depend to a significant extent on a limited number of customers 
as a result  the loss of or a reduction in sales to any one of these customers would have a significant adverse impact on our operations and financial performance 
international revenue  which consists of sales to customers with operations principally in western europe and asia  comprised of total revenue for  for and for cost of revenue our cost of revenue consists of the cost of product  services  maintenance and support  and includes compensation for distribution personnel and the cost of third party components  the cost of compensation for installation  maintenance  support  training and engineering personnel and other costs related to facilities and office equipment for professional services  technical support and training personnel 
we recognize product costs when the revenue from the sale of such products is recorded  and we recognize costs of installation  maintenance  software development  support and training services as we incur those expenses 
operating expenses we generally recognize our operating expenses as we incur them in three operational categories research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative 
our operating expenses also include amortization of our deferred stock compensation charges related to stock options granted prior to our initial public offering 
these charges are amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the options  generally four years 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation 
table of contents expenses for our personnel  patent and licensing costs 
due to uncertainties about the estimated future economic benefits and lives of our patents and patent applications  all related patent costs are expensed as incurred 
our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation  commissions  travel expenses and other internal and outside marketing expenses 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for our administrative and financial personnel and a number of non allocable costs  including insurance  professional fees  legal fees  accounting fees and provision for doubtful accounts receivable balances 
we allocate the total cost of overhead and facilities to each of the functional areas that use overhead and facilities  based upon the number of employees assigned to each of these areas 
these allocated charges include facilities rent  utilities  telecommunications  and depreciation expense for property and equipment 
amortization of deferred stock compensation relates to stock options issued to employees and represents the difference between the exercise price of options granted to employees and the grant date fair value of our common stock 
based on the outstanding options at december   we anticipate recording charges of approximately  in to record the remainder of the costs associated with these grants 
future compensation expense may be decreased in a period of forfeiture for any accrued but unvested compensation arising from the termination of an option holder s services 
in addition  we have granted options to acquire shares of common stock to non employees who have provided consulting services 
for  we recognized an expense of approximately  related to these non employee options 
for  we recognized an expense of approximately  related to these non employee options 
pursuant to the provisions of sfas  the fair value of non employee options issued was determined based on the fair value of the consideration received  where such amount was reliably measurable  or the fair value of the equity instruments issued  in which case  the fair value was estimated as services were provided using the black scholes option pricing model 
valuation of accounts receivable estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on our historical collection experience  historical write offs  current trends and the credit quality of our customer base and the characteristics of our accounts receivable by aging category 
if the allowance for doubtful accounts was understated  our operating income could be significantly reduced 
the impact of any such change or deviation may be increased by our reliance on a relatively small number of customers for a large portion of our total revenue 
as of december   approximately of our accounts receivable balance was concentrated with one customer 
as of december   approximately of our accounts receivable were concentrated with two customers  each of whom represented more than of our total accounts receivable 
valuation of inventories we record a provision for obsolete or excess inventory for models that are no longer manufactured or are at risk of being replaced with new versions of our product 
in determining the allowance for obsolete or excess inventory  we look at our forecasted demand versus quantities on hand and commitments 
any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and commitments and our reported results 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs  provision for purchase commitments and charges against earnings may be required  which would negatively effect our operating income for such period

table of contents comparison of  and revenue total revenue decreased by in to million from million for the decrease in total revenue in relative to was due to lower product sales 
lower product sales in were due in large part to the continued slowdown experienced in the economy and in the financial services industry in particular  resulting in constrained budgets and delayed procurement decisions by existing and potential customers 
for  two customers accounted for of our total revenue 
for  three customers accounted for of our total revenue 
the level of sales to any customer may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year 
we anticipate that our revenue will continue to depend on a limited number of major customers for the foreseeable future  although the companies considered to be major customers and the percentage of revenue represented by each major customer may vary from period to period 
the loss of any one of those customers would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 
total revenue decreased by in to million from million for the decrease in total revenue in relative to was due primarily to lower product sales and the general slowdown experienced in the economy

liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations since inception primarily from product and services revenue  the net proceeds of million from our august initial public offering of common stock  lines of credit with related parties and financial institutions  and  to a lesser extent  the proceeds of approximately million from the sale of series b preferred stock in december we had cash and cash equivalents of million as of december  and million as of december  for  we had a net cash outflow of million resulting primarily from net cash used in operations of million  which was offset by proceeds from net sales of short term investments of million 
the net cash used in operations primarily reflected a net loss of million  a decrease in accrued liabilities and other of million and a decrease in deferred revenue and customer deposits of million  but was partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million and non cash stock compensation expense of million 
the cash outflows associated with the net loss  reduced accrued liabilities and reduced accounts receivable reflect the smaller scale of our business in relative to for  we had a net cash outflow of million resulting primarily from net cash used in operations of million  net purchases of short term investments of million and purchases of property and equipment of million 
the net cash used in operations primarily reflected a net loss of million  a decrease in accounts payable of million and a decrease in deferred revenue and customer deposits of million  but was partially offset by non cash stock compensation expense of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million and a decrease in inventories of million

the net cash used in operations of million included a net loss of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in inventories of million  but was partially offset by the non cash amortization of stock compensation expense of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  an increase in deferred revenue of million and an increase in accrued liabilities and other of million 
expenditures for property and equipment for were approximately million 
at december   we did not have any material commitments for future capital expenditures 
we anticipate spending approximately million in capital expenditures in the next months 

table of contents under a line of credit we obtained prior to  we had million outstanding at december  we incurred a total of  in interest expense on this line of credit during  at an average interest rate of 
this line of credit was retired using a portion of the proceeds from a million one year line of credit we obtained from a financial institution in june this replacement line of credit was subsequently repaid and retired in december with a portion of our proceeds from our august initial public offering 
no interest expense was incurred during we had no outstanding borrowings at december  from our previous lines of credit 
on february   we entered into a loan and security agreement with a financial institution to borrow up to million as a revolving line of credit and million as an equipment term loan 
the first million of the revolving line was available on a non formula basis and the remainder was limited to of our eligible accounts receivable 
as collateral under this loan and security agreement  we granted a first priority interest in all our assets  excluding intellectual property 
the revolving line of credit and the equipment term loan required certain covenants to be met 
on december   we entered into an amendment to the loan and security agreement to increase the maximum funds available there under to million and extend the term of the agreement 
the amended loan and security agreement  as further amended in march  has an expiration date of february  the agreement  as amended  retains a first priority security interest in all our assets  excluding intellectual property 
gerald burnett  our chairman and chief executive officer has provided a collateralized guarantee  assuring payment of our obligations under the agreement and as a consequence  a number of restrictive covenants from the original loan and security agreement have been deleted in the amendment  allowing us greater access to the full amount of the facility 
in addition  gerald burnett has provided to us a commitment to provide funds up to million inclusive of any funds drawn by us and subject to his collateralized guarantee of our obligation to the bank through february  in the event that the amended loan and security agreement is not sufficiently available to us for any reason 
as of december  we did not have any outstanding borrowings under this line of credit and we were eligible to borrow up to million 
we intend to continue to invest in the development of new products and enhancements to our existing products 
we currently believe that existing cash and cash equivalents balances  short term investments and available borrowings under the loan and security agreement  as amended  and the commitment from our ceo will provide us with sufficient funds to finance our operations for the next months 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including without limitation  general economic conditions and conditions in the financial services industry in particular  the level and timing of revenue  the costs and timing of our product development efforts and the success of these development efforts  the costs and timing of our sales and marketing activities  the extent to which our existing and new products gain market acceptance  competing technological and market developments  the costs involved in maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights including  without limitation  the costs and result of cpi s litigation with polycom and other factors  all of which may impact our ability to achieve and maintain profitability 
we expect that we will need to arrange for the availability of additional funding upon the expiration of the loan and security agreement  either through the execution of an extension of the loan and security agreement or through other means  in order to meet our future business requirements for the following months 
we may be required to raise additional funds and additional financing may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional funding on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities  or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could seriously harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and ability to continue operations 
there can be no assurance that such funding will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock  and debt financing  if available  may involve significant fees  interest payment obligations and restrictive covenants 
strategic arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish our rights to certain of our technologies or products 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas revises the accounting for specified employee and contract terminations that are part of restructuring activities 
companies will be able to record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity only when the liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 
commitment to an exit plan or a plan of disposal expresses only management s intended future actions and therefore  does not meet the requirement for recognizing a liability and related expense 
sfas only applies to termination benefits offered for a specific termination event or a specified period 
sfas will not affect accounting for the costs to terminate a capital lease 
we are required to adopt this statement for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we do not expect the of sfas adoption to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  summary of statement accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement sfas amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent 
table of contents disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas  effective for our fiscal year ending december   to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents factors affecting future operating results our market is in the early stages of development  and our system may not be widely accepted 
our ability to achieve profitability depends in large part on the widespread adoption of networked video communications systems 
if the market for our system fails to grow or grows more slowly than we anticipate  we may not be able to increase revenue or achieve profitability 
the market for our system is relatively new and evolving 
we will have to devote substantial resources to educating prospective customers about the uses and benefits of our system 
our efforts to educate potential customers may not result in our system achieving market acceptance 
in addition  businesses that have invested or may invest substantial resources in video products may be reluctant or slow to adopt our system 
similarly  customers using existing information systems in which they have made significant investments may refuse to adopt our system if they perceive that our offerings will not complement their existing systems 
consequently  the conversion from traditional methods of communication to the extensive use of networked video may not occur as rapidly as we wish 
we have incurred substantial losses in the past and may not be profitable in the future 
we incurred net losses of million for  million for  and million for as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
our revenue may not increase  or even remain at its current level 
in addition  our operating expenses may increase as we continue to develop our business in the future 
as a result  to become profitable  we will need to increase our revenue by increasing sales to existing customers and by attracting additional customers 
if our expenses increase more rapidly than our revenue  or if revenue and expense levels remain the same  we may never become profitable 
if we fail to achieve our plan of generating positive cash flow from operations over the next months  we may be required to raise additional funds  and additional financing may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
although our chairman and chief executive officer has guaranteed our loan and security agreement  we cannot be certain that he will continue to do so 
we cannot predict whether or when we will become profitable 
if we do become profitable  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
in addition  if we fail to reach profitability or to sustain or grow our profits within the time frame expected by investors  the market price of our common stock may be adversely impacted 
general economic conditions have and may continue to reduce our revenues and harm our business 
economic growth in the united states has slowed to the point where industries are delaying or reducing technology purchases 
these conditions have negatively affected our business in and  and will in the future if these conditions persist 
if our customers and potential customers continue to delay ordering our products  we will fall short of our revenue expectations for and beyond 
the outlook for the video communications industry is uncertain and it is very difficult to predict how long the current slowdown will last 
slower growth among our customers  tightening of customers operating budgets  retrenchment in the capital markets and other general economic factors all have had and could continue to have a materially adverse effect on our revenue  capital resources  financial condition and results of operations 
we have filed a complaint alleging patent infringement against polycom  inc the prosecution of this lawsuit could require us to expend significant financial and managerial resources and may have a material negative impact on our business 
if we do not prevail  we may be required to pay monetary damages 
on september   cpi  our wholly owned subsidiary  commenced a patent infringement lawsuit against polycom  inc alleging that several polycom videoconferencing products infringe four patents held by our wholly owned subsidiary  cpi 
the suit was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california 
the four patents involved are us patent nos 
   and  these patents cover technologies relating to video and data conferencing over unshielded twisted pair utp networks  distributed call state management  separate monitors for simultaneous computer based data sharing and videoconferencing and remote participant hold and disconnect functions in multi party conferencing 
polycom responded to cpi s claims on november   at which time it both answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims against cpi for non infringement  invalidity and unenforceability 
on january  polycom filed a motion with the court requesting permission to amend its counterclaims to incorporate claims of alleged infringements by avistar communications of four picturetel patents that polycom has told us it has had assigned to it 
a hearing was held on march   at which time the judge granted polycom s motion to amend its counterclaims 
a trial date for cpi s claims against polycom and polycom s proposed counterclaims has not yet been set 
the prosecution of this lawsuit and the defense of the proposed polycom counterclaim may require us to expend significant financial and managerial resources and therefore may have a material negative impact on our business 
the duration and ultimate 
table of contents outcome of this litigation are uncertain 
in addition  an adverse judgment  if entered against cpi or avistar  could require cpi or avistar to pay substantial compensation and or damages to polycom  which could harm our business  financial position and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline substantially 
it should be noted that avistar s agreement with a third party supplier whose products are implicated by polycom s claims of alleged patent infringement  provides for indemnification to avistar by that third party 
nevertheless  litigation such as this suit can take years to resolve and can be expensive to prosecute 
regardless of the outcome  the prosecution of our claims in this lawsuit may require us to obtain additional financing 
our expected future working capital needs may require that we seek additional debt or equity funding which  if not available  could cause our business to suffer 
our future liquidity and working capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including general economic conditions and conditions in the financial services industry in particular  the level and timing of our revenue  the costs and timing of product development efforts and the success of these development efforts  the costs and timing of sales and marketing activities  the extent to which our existing and new products gain market acceptance  competing technological and market developments  the costs involved in maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other ip rights  including the costs associated with cpi s litigation with polycom  and available borrowings under line of credit arrangements and other factors 
although we have renewed our loan and security agreement  which provides a credit line of million with comerica bank california  we may need to arrange for the availability of additional funding in order to meet our future business requirements 
if we are unable to obtain additional funding when needed on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities  respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  or finance our litigation with polycom  which could seriously harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and ability to continue operations 
there can be no assurance that such funding will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
our chairman and chief executive officer has personally guaranteed the loan and security agreement 
we cannot be sure that he will be willing to continue to guarantee our borrowings based on the available terms  if at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
strategic arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish our rights to certain of our technologies or products 
our lengthy sales cycle to acquire new customers or large follow on orders may cause our quarterly operating results to vary significantly and make it more difficult to forecast our revenue 
we have generally experienced a product sales cycle of four to nine months for new customers or large follow on orders due to the time needed to educate customers about the uses and benefits of our system  and the significant investment decisions that our prospective customers must make when they decide to buy our system 
many of our prospective customers have neither budgeted expenses for networked video communications systems  or for personnel specifically dedicated to the procurement  installation or support of these systems 
as a result  our customers spend a substantial amount of time before purchasing our system in performing internal reviews and obtaining capital expenditure approvals 
current economic conditions have contributed to additional deliberation  and an associated delay in the sales cycle 
our lengthy sales cycle is one of the factors that has caused  and may in the future continue to cause  our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year 
this makes it difficult for us to forecast revenue  and could cause volatility in 
table of contents the market price of our common stock 
a lost or delayed order could result in lower revenue than expected in a particular quarter or year 
since a majority of our revenue has come from follow on orders  our financial performance could be harmed if we fail to obtain follow on orders in the future 
our customers typically place limited initial orders for our networked video communications system  as they seek to evaluate its usefulness and value 
our strategy is to pursue additional and larger follow on orders after these initial orders 
revenue generated from follow on orders accounted for approximately of our revenue in and in current economic conditions have led to decreases in our clients capital spending  and we have experienced a decrease in the size and number of follow on orders 
our future financial performance depends on successful initial installations of our system and successful generation of follow on orders as the avistar network expands within a customer organization 
if our system does not meet the needs and expectations of customers  we may not be able to generate follow on orders 
because we depend on a few customers for a majority of our revenue  the loss of one or more of them could cause a significant decrease in our revenue 
we have historically derived the majority of our revenue from a limited number of customers  particularly deutsche bank and jp morgan chase and their affiliates 
collectively  these customers accounted for of our revenue for this contribution reflects the acquisition by deutsche bank of other financial services firms that were previously avistar customers  as well as the purchase of avistar technology by deutsche bank for new accounts as part of deutsche bank s client connectivity program 
for  deutsche bank  jp morgan chase and ubs warburg llc and their affiliates accounted for of our revenue 
we expect to continue to depend upon a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue 
as of december   approximately of our accounts receivable were concentrated with one customer 
as of december   approximately of our accounts receivable were concentrated with two customers  each of whom represented more than of our total accounts receivable balance 
the loss of a major customer or the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more of our significant customers could cause our revenue to decline and our losses to increase 
because we currently depend on a limited number of customers with lengthy budgeting cycles and unpredictable buying patterns  our revenue from quarter to quarter or year to year may be volatile 
adverse changes in our revenue or operating results as a result of these budgeting cycles or any other reduction in capital expenditures by our large customers could substantially reduce the trading price of our common stock 
we may not be able to modify and improve our products in a timely and cost effective manner to respond to technological change and customer demands 
future hardware and software platforms embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and customer requirements could render our system non competitive or even obsolete 
the market for our system is characterized by rapid technological change  significant development costs  changes in the requirements of our customers and their communities of users  evolving industry standards  and transition to internet protocol connectivity for video at the desktop  with increasing availability of bandwidth 
our system is designed to work with a variety of hardware and software configurations and data networking infrastructures used by our customers 
the majority of these customer networks rely on microsoft windows nt servers 
however  our software may not operate correctly on other hardware and software platforms or with other programming languages  database environments and systems that our customers use 
also  we must constantly modify and improve our system to keep pace with changes made to our customers platforms  data networking infrastructures  and their evolving ability to transport video and other applications 
this may result in uncertainty relating to the timing and nature of our new release announcements  introductions or modifications  which in turn may cause confusion in the market  with a potentially harmful effect on our business 
if we fail to promptly modify or improve our system 
table of contents in response to evolving industry standards or customers demands  our system could become obsolete  which would harm our financial condition and reputation 
difficulties or delays in installing our products could harm our revenue and margins 
we recognize revenue upon the installation of our system in those cases where we are responsible for installation  which often entails working with sophisticated software and computing and communications systems 
if we experience difficulties with installation or do not meet deadlines due to delays caused by our customers or ourselves  we could be required to devote more customer support  technical and other resources to a particular installation 
if we encounter delays in installing our products for new or existing customers or installation requires significant amounts of our professional services support  our revenue recognition could be delayed  our costs could increase and our margins could suffer 
competition could reduce our market share and decrease our revenue 
currently  our competition comes from many other kinds of companies  including communication equipment  integrated solution  broadcast video and stand alone point solution providers 
within the video enabled network communications market  we compete primarily against polycom  tandberg inc and vcon telecommunications ltd 
we believe we may face increasing competition in the future from alternative video communications solutions that employ new technologies or new combinations of technologies from companies such as cisco systems  inc  hewlett packard company  microsoft corporation  realnetworks  inc and webex communications  inc  that enable web based or network based video communications with low cost digital camera systems 
the market in which we operate is highly competitive 
in addition  because our industry is relatively new and one which is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving user needs  developing industry standards and protocols and the frequent introduction of new products and services  it is difficult for us to predict whether or when new competing technologies or new competitors will enter our market 
we expect competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and from new market entrants with products that may be less expensive than ours or that may provide better performance or additional features not currently provided by our products 
many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  distribution and other resources  greater name recognition and market presence  longer operating histories  lower cost structures and larger customer bases than we do 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
we may be required to reduce prices or increase spending in response to competition in order to retain or attract customers  pursue new market opportunities or invest in additional research and development efforts 
as a result  our revenue  margins and market share may be harmed 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  or that competitive pressures faced by us will not harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
infringement of our proprietary rights could affect our competitive position  harm our reputation or cost us money 
we regard our system as open but proprietary 
in an effort to protect our proprietary rights  we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as licensing  non disclosure and other agreements with our consultants  suppliers  customers and employees 
however  these laws and agreements provide only limited protection of our proprietary rights 
in addition  we may not have signed agreements in every case and the contractual provisions that are in place and the protection they produce may not provide us with adequate protection in all circumstances 
although cpi holds patents and has filed patent applications covering some of the inventions embodied in our systems  our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate 
it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization and without our detection 
in the event that we believe a third party is infringing our intellectual property rights  an infringement claim brought by us could  regardless of the outcome  result in substantial cost to us  divert our management s attention and resources  be time consuming to prosecute and result in unpredictable damage awards 
a third party may also develop similar technology independently  without infringing upon our patents and copyrights 
in addition  the laws of some countries in which we sell our system may not protect our software and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
unauthorized copying  use or reverse engineering of our system could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents infringement claims could require us to expend significant financial and managerial resources 
a third party could claim that our technology infringes upon its proprietary rights 
as the number of software systems in our target market increases and the functionality of these systems overlap  we believe that the number of infringement suits filed by software developers may increase 
in the existing lawsuit in which cpi is claiming that polycom infringes four cpi patents  polycom has filed a motion with the court requesting permission to amend its counterclaims to incorporate claims of alleged infringements by avistar communications of four picturetel patents that polycom has told us it has had assigned to it 
a hearing was held on march   at which time the judge granted polycom s motion to amend its counterclaims 
a trial date for cpi s claims against polycom and polycom s proposed counterclaims has not yet been set 
it should be noted that avistar s agreement with a third party supplier whose products are implicated by polycom s claims of alleged patent infringement  provides for indemnification to avistar by that third party 
nevertheless  defending against any infringement claims  even those that are not meritorious  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources  could take years to resolve and may require us to obtain additional financing 
in addition  if we are found liable for infringement  it could require cpi or avistar to pay substantial compensation and or damages to polycom and we may not be able to continue offering that portion of our system that is found to be infringing 
redesigning our system components to avoid alleged or actual infringement could result in the expenditure of significant and managerial resources and diminish the value of our system  which could harm our business  financial position and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline substantially 
our system could have defects for which we could be held liable for  and which could result in lost revenue  increased costs  loss of our credibility or delay in the further acceptance of our system in the market 
our system may contain errors or defects  especially when new products are introduced or when new versions are released 
despite internal system testing  we have in the past discovered software errors in some of the versions of our system after their introduction 
errors in new systems or versions could be found after commencement of commercial shipments  and this could result in additional development costs  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts or the loss of credibility with current or future customers 
any of these events could result in a loss of revenue or a delay in market acceptance of our system and could harm our reputation 
in addition  we have warranted to some of our customers that our software is free of viruses 
if a virus infects a customer s computer software  the customer could assert claims against us  which  regardless of their merits  could be costly to defend and could require us to pay damages and potentially harm our reputation 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability and certain contract claims 
our license agreements also typically limit a customer s entire remedy to either a refund of the price paid or modification of our system to satisfy our warranty 
however  these provisions vary as to their terms and may not be effective under the laws of some jurisdictions 
although we maintain product liability insurance coverage  we cannot assure you that such coverage will be adequate 
a product liability  warranty or other claim could harm our business  financial condition and or results of operations 
performance interruptions at a customer s site could negatively affect the demand for our system or give rise to claims against us 
the third party software we license with our system may also contain errors or defects for which we do not maintain insurance 
typically  our license agreements transfer any warranty from the third party to our customers to the extent permitted 
product liability  warranty or other claims brought against us with respect to such warranties could  regardless of their merits  harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the loss of any of our outside contract manufacturers or third party equipment suppliers that produce key components of our system could significantly disrupt our manufacturing and new product development process 
we depend on outside contract manufacturers to produce components of our systems 
most of our compression and decompression product  or gateway product  is currently supplied by a single source  tandberg  inc in addition  we depend on various third party suppliers for the cameras  microphones  speakers and monitors that we install at desktops and in conference rooms as a part of each video communications network system 
two of these contract manufacturers  sae materials inc and pacific corporation  are single source suppliers for key components of our products 
another supplier  equator technologies inc  is our only current source of a component to be used in products recently introduced to the marketplace 
our reliance on these third parties involves a number of risks  including 
table of contents the possible unavailability of critical services and components on a timely basis  on commercially reasonable terms or at all  if the components necessary for our system were to become unavailable  the need to qualify new or alternative components for our use or reconfigure our system and manufacturing process could be lengthy and expensive  the likelihood that  if particular components were not available  we would suffer an interruption in the manufacture and shipment of our systems until these components or alternatives become available  reduced control by us over the quality and cost of our system and over our ability to respond to unanticipated changes and increases in customer orders  and conversely  price changes from suppliers if committed volumes are not met  and the possible unavailability of  or interruption in  access to some technologies due to infringement claims  production supply issues or other hindrances 
if these manufacturers or suppliers cease to provide us with the assistance or the components necessary for the operation of our business  we may not be able to identify alternate sources in a timely fashion 
any transition to alternate manufacturers or suppliers would likely result in operational problems and increased expenses and could cause delays in the shipment of or otherwise limit our ability to provide our products 
in the case of the gateway component  we believe a delay could be several months or more 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to enter into agreements with new manufacturers or suppliers on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
any disruption in product flow may limit our revenue  delay our product development  seriously harm our competitive position and or result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers 
if we are unable to expand our direct sales force and or add distribution channels  our business will suffer 
to increase our revenue  we must increase the size of our direct sales force and add indirect distribution channels  such as systems integrators  product partners and or value added resellers  or effect sales through our customers 
if we are unable to maintain or increase our direct sales force or add indirect distribution channels due to our own cost constraints  limited availability of qualified personnel or other reasons  our future revenue growth may be limited and our future operating results may suffer 
there is intense pressure to contain our sales and marketing costs in response to continued weakness in demand for our products 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting  integrating  motivating and retaining sales personnel 
furthermore  it can take several months before a new hire becomes a productive member of our sales force 
the loss of existing direct and or indirect salespeople  or the failure of new salespeople and or indirect sales partners to develop the necessary skills in a timely manner  could reduce our revenue growth 
we may not be able to retain our existing key personnel  or hire and retain the additional personnel that we need to sustain and grow our business 
our products and technologies are complex and to successfully implement our business strategy and manage our business  an in depth understanding of video communication and collaboration technologies and their potential uses is required 
we depend on the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel 
we do not have long term employment agreements with our executive officers or other key personnel and we do not carry any key man life insurance 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or key personnel could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we need to attract and retain highly skilled technical and managerial personnel for whom there is intense competition 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified technical and managerial personnel due to our own cost constraints  limited availability of qualified personnel or other reasons  our results of operations could suffer and we may never achieve profitability 
the failure of new personnel to develop the necessary skills in a timely manner could harm our business 
our plans call for growth in our business  and our inability to achieve or manage growth could harm our business 
failure to achieve or manage growth effectively will harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
furthermore  in order to remain competitive or to expand our business  we may find it necessary or desirable in the future to acquire other businesses  products or technologies 
if we identify an appropriate acquisition candidate  we may not be able to negotiate the terms of the acquisition successfully  to finance the acquisition or to integrate the acquired businesses  products or technologies into our existing business and operations 
in addition  completing a potential acquisition and integrating an acquired business may strain our resources and require significant management time 

table of contents our international operations expose us to potential tariffs and other trade barriers  unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements and laws and economic and political instability  as well as other risks that could adversely affect our results of operations 
international revenue  which consists of sales to customers with operations principally in western europe and asia  comprised of total revenue for and for some of the risks we may encounter in conducting international business activities include the following tariffs and other trade barriers  unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements and laws  economic and political instability  increased risk of infringement claims  restrictions on the repatriation of funds  potentially adverse tax consequences  timing  cost and potential difficulty of adapting our system to the local language standards in those foreign countries that do not use the english language  fluctuations in foreign currencies  and limitations in communications infrastructures in some foreign countries 
international political instability may increase our cost of doing business and disrupt our business 
increased international political instability  evidenced by the threat or occurrence of terrorist attacks  enhanced national security measures and or sustained military action may halt or hinder our ability to do business  may increase our costs and may adversely affect our stock price 
this increased instability has had and may continue to have negative effects on financial markets  including significant price and volume fluctuations in securities markets 
if this international political instability continues or escalates  our business and results of operations could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline 
if our customers do not perceive our system or services to be effective or of high quality  our brand and name recognition would suffer 
we believe that establishing and maintaining brand and name recognition is critical for attracting and expanding our targeted customer base 
we also believe that the importance of reputation and name recognition will increase as competition in our market increases 
promotion and enhancement of our name will depend on the success of our marketing efforts  and on our ability to continue to provide high quality systems and services  neither of which can be assured 
if our customers do not perceive our system or services to be effective or of high quality  our brand and name recognition will suffer  which would harm our business 
we may not meet the continued listing criteria for the nasdaq smallcap market  which could materially adversely affect the price and liquidity of our stock  our business and our financial condition 
until october   our common stock was listed on the nasdaq national market 
continued listing on the nasdaq national market requires that the minimum closing bid price of our common stock not fall below for consecutive trading days 
on july   we received notification from the nasdaq stock market that we were out of compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement of per share set forth in marketplace rule a 
therefore  our common stock became subject to delisting from trading on the nasdaq national market on or about october  when the minimum closing bid price of our common stock did not equal or exceed for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days 
on october   we applied for trading of our common stock on the nasdaq smallcap market 
nasdaq approved this application and our common stock was transferred to the nasdaq smallcap market on october  despite the fact that the closing bid price of our common stock was below the minimum closing bid price requirement of the nasdaq smallcap market on that date 
nasdaq allows companies that meet the listing requirements of the nasdaq smallcap market other than the minimum closing bid price an initial grace period of days to regain compliance by posting a minimum closing bid price of for at least ten consecutive trading days 
with the acceptance of our application to switch to the nasdaq smallcap market  our day grace period to achieve the minimum bid requirements  which commenced july   was extended to days  or through january  on january   we were notified by nasdaq that we had been extended an additional day grace period to meet the minimum closing bid price requirement  or until july  the closing bid price of our common stock remained above 
table of contents for at least ten consecutive trading days in february nasdaq has advised us that we have met the minimum closing bid price requirement for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market as of february  however  there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet all requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market  including the minimum bid price requirement  the requirement for a minimum stockholder s equity of million or the other continued listing standards of such market 
if we are unable to continue to list our common stock for trading on the nasdaq smallcap market  there may be adverse impact on the market price and liquidity of our common stock  and our stock may be subject to the penny stock rules contained in section g of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and the rules promulgated there under 
delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq smallcap market could also materially adversely affect our business  including  among other things our ability to raise additional financing to fund our operations  our ability to attract and retain customers  and our ability to attract and retain personnel  including management personnel 
in addition  if we were unable to list our common stock for trading on nasdaq  many institutional investors would no longer be able to retain their interests in and or make further investments in our common stock because of their internal rules and protocols 
our common stock has been and will likely continue to be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors  many of which will be beyond our control  that may prevent our stockholders from reselling our common stock at a profit 
the trading price of our common stock has in the past been and could in the future be subject to significant fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in our results of operations  announcements regarding our product developments  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us  our customers or competitors  announcements of competitive product introductions by our competitors or our customers  sales or the perception in the market of possible sales of a large number of shares of our common stock by our directors  officers  employees or principal stockholders  and developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights  including our litigation with polycom  or other events 
if our revenue and results of operations are below the expectations of public market securities analysts or investors  then significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock could occur 
in addition  the securities markets have  from time to time  experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices for high technology companies and which often are unrelated and disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
if our share price is volatile  we may be the target of securities litigation  which is costly and time consuming to defend 
in the past  following periods of market volatility in the price of a company s securities  security holders have often instituted class action litigation 
many technology companies have been subject to this type of litigation 
our share price has  in the past  experienced price volatility  and may continue to do so in the future 
if the market value of our common stock experiences adverse fluctuations and we become involved in this type of litigation  regardless of the merits or outcome  we could incur substantial legal costs and our management s attention could be diverted  causing our business  financial condition and operating results to suffer 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  despite the possible benefits to our stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that may inhibit changes in our control that are not approved by our board of directors 
for example  the board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms of this preferred stock  without any further vote or action on the part of the stockholders 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in our control despite possible benefits to our stockholders  may discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock  and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of our stockholders 

table of contents our principal stockholders can exercise a controlling influence over our business affairs and they may make business decisions with which you disagree that will affect the value of your investment 
our executive officers  directors and entities affiliated with them  in the aggregate  beneficially owned approximately of our common stock as of december  if they were to act together  these stockholders would be able to exercise control over most matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
these actions may be taken even if they are opposed by other investors 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products primarily in the united states and sell those products primarily in north america  europe and asia 
international revenue  which consists of sales to customers with operations principally in western europe and asia  comprised of total revenue for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  as a result  our financial condition could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
as all of our sales are currently made in united states dollars  a strengthening of the united states dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  nor do we engage in any foreign currency hedging transactions 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of united states interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
we expect that our interest income will be negatively affected by declines in short term interest rates 
cash and cash equivalents and short term investments cash equivalents consist primarily of commercial paper and money market and municipal bond funds acquired with remaining maturity periods of three months or less and are stated at cost  plus accrued interest that approximates market value 
short term investments consist of corporate notes that are classified as available for sale and are stated at fair value 
we would not expect our operating results or cash flow to be significantly impacted by the effect of sudden changes in market interest rates given the nature of our short term investments
