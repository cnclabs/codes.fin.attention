semiconductor market performance the following table sets forth total worldwide semiconductor industry revenues and revenues in our total addressable market for the last three years total total worldwide addressable semiconductor market year ended december  industry sales change sales  change in billions in billions based on shipment information published by world semiconductor trade statistics wsts  an industry research firm 
wsts collects this information based on product shipments  which is different from our revenue recognition policy as described in critical accounting policies revenue recognition contained elsewhere in this report 
we believe the data provided by wsts is reliable  but we have not independently verified it 
wsts periodically revises their information 
we assume no obligation to update such information 

table of contents our total addressable market comprises the following specific wsts product categories a discrete products all discrete semiconductors other than sensors  rf and microwave power transistors modules  rf and microwave diodes  rf and microwave ss transistors  power fet modules  igbt modules and optoelectronics  b standard analog products amplifiers  voltage regulators and references  comparators  assp consumer  assp computer  assp automotive and assp industrial and others  and c standard logic products general purpose logic and mos general purpose logic only 
although we categorize our products as power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components  wsts uses different product categories 
we no longer participate in certain product categories in which we participated in and  accordingly  we will not include these product categories when determining our total addressable market in the future 
if such product categories had been excluded from our total addressable market in  sales in our total addressable market in would have been billion as compared to billion 
worldwide semiconductor market sales were billion in  including sales in our total addressable market of approximately billion 
in  industry sales and sales in our total addressable market increased and  respectively  as compared to the industry is cyclical  and from to industry sales and sales in our total addressable market declined from billion to billion and from billion to billion  respectively 
the foregoing information is based on information published by wsts 
the year was the worst single year downturn in industry history and was driven both by reduced volumes and lower average selling prices resulting from an inventory overbuild as well as excess semiconductor manufacturing capacity 
this is in contrast to  when industry sales and sales in our total addressable market grew and  respectively 
although semiconductor demand began to improve in  it is uncertain when any meaningful recovery will occur 
current market conditions are characterized by excess capacity  short lead times and significant pricing pressures  particularly in a number of product lines in which we participate 
on financial performance revenues the following table sets forth our total revenues for through year ended december  total revenues change in millions revenues for the year ended december  are pro forma to reflect what our total revenues would have been had the change in distributor revenue recognition methods implemented effective january  been applied retroactively 
see note accounting changes of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements and other significant events accounting changes  in each case included elsewhere in this report 
we believe this presentation is useful to investors in comparing historical results and this presentation is used by our management in making historical comparisons 
our total revenues declined in from while total sales in our total addressable market declined during the same period 
during that period  revenues from our high frequency clock and data management business declined million  or  and foundry services provided to motorola decreased million 
our total revenues declined in from while total sales in our total addressable market increased by during the same period 
during this period  revenues from our high frequency clock and data management business declined further  foundry services provided to motorola were reduced by million  production of certain products was discontinued and certain low margin opportunities were not pursued 

table of contents profitability enhancement programs in order to better align our cost structure with our revenues  we initiated profitability enhancement programs in the fourth quarter of and in the fourth quarter of the principal elements of these programs are a manufacturing rationalization plan  a reduction of non manufacturing personnel and other cost controls 
the elements of the plan that we commenced in june were completed in the fourth quarter of and resulted in million of annualized cost savings  based on a comparison of our cost structure during the first quarter of to our cost structure during the third quarter of we expect the plan to be completed by the end of and to result in an estimated million of cost savings in and an estimated million of annual cost savings thereafter  in both cases as compared to our cost structure during the third quarter of savings from these plans include reduced employee costs resulting from staff reductions  reduced depreciation expense resulting from asset impairments and other cost savings resulting from the transfer of certain manufacturing and administrative functions to lower cost regions  renegotiation of service and supply contracts  and other actions taken to improve our manufacturing efficiency 
the following table summarizes the annual cost savings from the plan by type and by the applicable caption contained in our consolidated statement of operations in millions reduced other employee reduced cost costs depreciation savings total cost of sales research and development sales and marketing general and administrative the following table summarizes the estimated annual cost savings from the plan that we expect annually following by type of cost and by the applicable caption contained in our consolidated statement of operations in millions reduced other employee cost costs savings total cost of sales research and development sales and marketing general and administrative manufacturing rationalization plan 
to create operating leverage and efficiencies and to accelerate our ongoing transformation into a leading low cost producer  we have implemented and continue to implement manufacturing cost saving initiatives such as the closure of some of our plants  the relocation or outsourcing of operations to take advantage of lower cost labor markets  the consolidation of other operations  the transfer of some of our external supply to internal operations and the rationalization of our product portfolio 
this plan included  among other actions  phasing out manufacturing operations at our guadalajara  mexico facility and transferring some of the manufacturing activities performed at our aizu  japan and seremban  malaysia facilities to some of our other facilities or to third party contractors 
in many cases  the volume from closed operations has been or is being shifted to our existing facilities in order to improve capacity utilization 
facility closures and production shifts have resulted in some reductions in our manufacturing capacity  but we do not expect these reductions to affect our ability to meet our foreseeable production needs 
as part of our plan described above  we completed manufacturing rationalization actions resulting in a reduction of our manufacturing workforce by from approximately  employees  as of december   to approximately  employees  as of december  and 
table of contents annualized cost savings of approximately million as compared to our cost structure in the first quarter of as part of our plan described above  we expect to complete further manufacturing rationalization actions by the fourth quarter of by december   we expect to generate annualized cost savings of approximately million as a result of these actions  including approximately million in respect of reduced wages and overhead for staff reductions and shifting manufacturing to lower cost regions  million of reductions in materials costs and million in manufacturing process improvements  as compared to our cost structure in the third quarter of reducing non manufacturing personnel and implementing other cost controls 
as part of our plan described above  we reduced selling  administrative and research and development personnel from approximately  as of june   to approximately  as of december  approximately of the employees involved in this reduction were in sales or marketing related positions  approximately were salaried employees in administrative or managerial positions and were employees in research and development positions 
as of september   we had achieved annualized cost savings of approximately million starting in the fourth quarter of as compared to our cost structure in the first quarter of as a result of these non manufacturing personnel reductions and other cost controls 
as part of our plan described above  we expect to further reduce selling and administrative personnel by employees by the fourth quarter of by december   we expect to generate annualized cost savings of approximately million as a result of these actions 
in connection with these reductions  we have adopted a more efficient hybrid sales force structure that combines direct sales personnel with sales representatives 
the employee figures above exclude employees of our joint venture in leshan  china 
outlook we expect the near term market to continue to be challenging but beginning to recover in the latter half of resulting in a to increase in total revenues for the year 
to increase our market share in the markets we serve  we have launched several initiatives to identify new customers and new opportunities within our existing customer base in selected product areas 
in addition  we have plans to accelerate our new product design in programs worldwide 
we expect that our gross margins will exceed per quarter by the end of the year assuming  among other things  the successful launch of new products and market share improvements 
our research and development expenses should be approximately of total revenues in  our sales and marketing expenses should be approximately of total revenues in  and  our general and administrative expenses should sequentially decline until these expenses reach approximately of total revenues in the fourth quarter of we plan to record a tax provision of million per quarter in given these and certain other expectations  we continue to expect to have positive earnings per share in the fourth quarter of see trends  risks and uncertainties elsewhere in this report 
liquidity and capital structure cash position and capital expenditures cash flows changed significantly in as compared to although our cash balance at december  increased by only million as compared to december   cash flows provided by operating activities were million in  a million improvement from the net cash usage of million in this increase was primarily the result of reduced costs resulting from the restructuring programs and reduced restructuring payments in we have  as part of a targeted effort to improve our liquidity  also reduced our capital expenditures from million in to million in and million in we do not expect that our capital expenditure reductions will have a negative impact on our ability to service our customers  as we believe that near term access to additional manufacturing capacity  should it be required  could be readily obtained on reasonable terms through manufacturing agreements with third parties 
capital expenditures are expected to increase to approximately million in debt refinancing during and the first quarter of  we refinanced a portion of our senior bank facilities through the issuance of million principal amount of our second lien senior secured notes due and million 
table of contents principal amount of our first lien senior secured notes due the net proceeds from these two transactions were used to prepay a portion of our senior bank facilities 
in connection with the issuance of the first lien senior secured notes  we amended our senior bank facilities to provide us additional financial flexibility by removing the requirement that we maintain certain minimum interest expense coverage ratios and that we do not exceed certain maximum leverage ratios  and by reducing to million our minimum ebitda requirement for any four consecutive fiscal quarters 
while we also reduced our permitted capital expenditures to million per year subject to certain increases for improved financial performance and carryovers from prior periods  we do not expect this reduction to have a significant impact on our operating plans or financial performance 
as a result of these refinancings we have extended our debt maturities 
assuming the first lien senior secured notes had been issued as of december   our total debt as of such date would amortize in the annual amounts shown below in millions actual actual maturities activity maturities maturities as of as of as adjusted december  december  december  additions repayments refinancing refinancing thereafter relates to impact on debt maturities resulting from the may issuance of the second lien senior secured notes due and prepayment of amounts outstanding under our senior bank facilities 
relates to impact on debt maturities resulting from the march issuance of the first lien senior secured notes due and prepayment of amounts outstanding under our senior bank facilities 
because the effective interest rates on the first lien and second lien senior secured notes  which are fixed  are considerably higher than those that currently apply to our senior bank facilities  which are floating  our interest expense will increase as a result of these refinancings 
at current rates that apply to our senior bank facilities  we expect net interest expense to be approximately million in other significant events accounting changes effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june   provide specific criteria for the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets apart from goodwill and require that unamortized negative goodwill be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain instead of being deferred and amortized 
sfas no 
also requires that  upon adoption of sfas no 
 we reclassify the carrying amounts of certain intangible assets into or out of goodwill based on certain criteria 
sfas no 
primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their initial recognition 
the provisions of sfas no 
prohibit the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and require that such assets be tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangible assets may be impaired  require that reporting units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill and remove the forty year limitation on the amortization period of intangible assets that have finite lives 
goodwill amortization expense totaled million in 
table of contents sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with the related carrying amount including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  the reporting unit s goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value  the second step test must be performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss  if any 
the second step test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination  with the carrying amount of such goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
our goodwill at january  totaled million and relates to the april acquisition of cherry semiconductor corporation cherry 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 we discontinued amortization of the cherry goodwill at the beginning of during the first quarter of  we identified our various reporting units  which correspond with our four product lines  and allocated its assets and liabilities to such reporting units 
the goodwill relating to the cherry acquisition was specifically identified with and included in our power management and standard analog reporting unit 
during the second quarter of  we completed the first step of its transitional goodwill impairment test and determined that the estimated fair value of the power management and standard analog reporting unit as of january  exceeded the reporting unit s carrying amount by a substantial amount 
as a result  an impairment of the cherry goodwill as of that date was not indicated and completion of the second step test was not required 
we updated our goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of and determined that a related impairment did not exist 
as mentioned below in critical accounting policies  effective january   we changed our accounting method for recognizing revenue on sales to distributors 
recognition of revenue and related gross profit on sales to distributors is now deferred until the distributor resells the product 
we believe that this change better aligns reported results with  focuses us on  and allows investors to better understand end user demand for the products that we sell through distributors 
our new revenue recognition policy is commonly used in the semiconductor industry 
the cumulative effect of the accounting change for periods prior to january  was a charge of million million  or per share  net of income taxes 
the accounting change resulted in an increase in revenues of million and a decrease in our net loss before cumulative effect of accounting change of million  or per share  for the year ended december  also effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  which establishes standards for the accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
our interest rate swaps in effect at january  were designated as cash flow hedges  were measured at fair value and recorded as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded an after tax charge of million to accumulated other comprehensive income loss as of january  this charge consisted of a million adjustment to record our interest rate swaps in the consolidated balance sheet at their estimated fair values as well as the write off of an approximate million pretax deferred charge included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december  relating to the payment made in december for the early termination of an interest rate protection agreement relating to a portion of the amounts outstanding under our senior bank facilities  both before income taxes of approximately million 
in addition to hedging a portion of our interest rate exposure  we use forward foreign currency contracts to reduce our overall exposure to the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations and cash flows 
the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded as assets or liabilities with gains and losses offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying assets or liabilities 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not impact our accounting and reporting for these derivative instruments 

table of contents acquisition on april   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of cherry semiconductor corporation cherry for approximately million in cash including acquisition related costs  which was financed with cash on hand and borrowings of million under our senior bank facilities 
cherry  which was renamed semiconductor components industries of rhode island  inc  designs and manufactures analog and mixed signal integrated circuits for the power management and automotive markets  and had revenues for its fiscal year ended february  of million 
the cherry acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and  as a result  the purchase price and related costs were allocated to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the time of the acquisition based on management estimates as follows in millions fair value of tangible net assets developed technology in process research and development assembled workforce excess of purchase price over estimated fair value of net assets acquired goodwill developed technology is being amortized on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of five years 
goodwill was being amortized on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of ten years  however  as mentioned previously  such amortization was discontinued upon the adoption of sfas no 
additionally  assembled workforce was being amortized over an estimated useful life of five years 
assembled workforce does not meet the sfas no 
requirements as an intangible asset apart from goodwill 
accordingly  upon adoption of sfas no 
 we reclassified the unamortized balance of assembled workforce to goodwill and the related amortization was discontinued 
the fair value of the acquired in process research and development was determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
significant assumptions that had to be made in using this approach included revenue and operating margin projections and determination of the applicable discount rate 
the fair value of the acquired in process research and development was based on sales forecasts and cost assumptions projected to be achievable by cherry on a stand alone basis 
operating margins were based on cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues 
all projected revenue and cost information was based on historical results and trends and did not include any synergies or cost savings that may result from the acquisition 
the rate used to discount future projected cash flows resulting from the acquired in process research and development was  which was derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis adjusted upward to reflect additional risks inherent in the development life cycle 
at the date of acquisition  the in process research and development consisted of sixty five projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and for which no alternative future uses had been identified 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date 
such projects were approximately to complete at the date of the acquisition 
the estimated cost to complete these projects at that date was approximately million 
of the sixty five projects in process at the date of acquisition  we completed thirty one projects  abandoned twenty nine projects and are in the process of completing the remaining five projects  which have an estimated completion cost of million 
subsequent to the acquisition date  we experienced an industry downturn that required us to scale back research and development activities 
due to the decline in product demand subsequent to the acquisition  revenues associated with the completed projects were approximately million  or of the amount originally forecasted for all acquired in process research and development projects at the date of acquisition 
critical accounting policies the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note significant accounting policies of the 
table of contents notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report contain a detailed summary of our significant accounting policies 
we believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations 
we utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue 
we generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to original equipment manufacturers  electronic manufacturing service providers  and distributors 
we recognize revenue on sales to original equipment manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service providers when title passes to the customer net of provisions for related sales returns and allowances 
prior to january   we recognized revenue on distributor sales when title passed to the distributor 
provisions were recorded at that time for estimated sales returns as well as for other related sales costs and allowances 
effective january   we changed our revenue recognition policy for distributor sales so that the related revenues are now deferred until the distributor resells the product to the end user 
this change eliminated the need to provide for estimated sales returns from distributors 
title to products sold to distributors typically passes at the time of shipment by us so we record accounts receivable for the amount of the transaction  reduce our inventory for the products shipped and defer the related margin in our consolidated balance sheet 
we recognize the related revenue and margin when the distributor sells the products to the end user 
although payment terms vary  most distributor agreements require payment within days 
we believe that this change better aligns our reported results with  focuses us on  and enables investors to better understand  end user demand for the products we sell through distribution as our revenue is not influenced by our distributors stocking decisions 
inventories 
we carry our inventories at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market and record provisions for slow moving inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected end user demand 
projected end user demand is generally based on sales during the prior twelve months 
these provisions can influence our results from operations 
for example  when demand falls for a given part  all or a portion of the related inventory is reserved  impacting our cost of sales and gross profit 
if demand recovers and the parts previously reserved are sold  we will generally recognize a higher than normal margin 
however  the vast majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded 
although we do sell some products that have previously been written down  such sales have historically been relatively consistent on a quarterly basis and the related impact on our margins has not been material 
deferred tax valuation allowance 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate 
if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets  we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense 
conversely  if we determine that we will ultimately be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided  the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense 
in the fourth quarter of  we established a valuation allowance for the majority of our deferred tax assets and throughout  we have not recognized any incremental deferred tax benefits 
we monitor our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and the continuing need for a related valuation allowance on an ongoing basis 
impairment of long lived assets 
we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property  plant and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset are less than its carrying amount 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results 
we continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset 
the dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests 

table of contents goodwill and other intangibles 
we evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit containing our goodwill with the related carrying amount 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  the reporting unit s goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value  the second step test must be performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss  if any 
the second step test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination  with the carrying amount of such goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
defined benefit plans 
we maintain pension plans covering certain of our employees 
for financial reporting purposes  net periodic pension costs are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including a discount rate for plan obligations  assumed rate of return on pension plan assets and assumed rate of compensation increase for plan employees 
all of these assumptions are based upon management s judgement  considering all known trends and uncertainties 
actual results that differ from these assumptions would impact the future expense recognition and cash funding requirements of our pension plans

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues 
total revenues decreased million  or  to  million in from  million in due to declines in average selling prices of approximately and a reduction of foundry revenues of approximately million 
the percentage of billings related to new products defined as products introduced within the prior months increased in as compared to the revenues by product line for the years ended december  and  respectively  are as follows dollars in millions year ended year ended december  as a december  as a dollar revenue revenue change change power management and standard analog mos power devices high frequency clock and data management standard components total revenues certain amounts may not total due to rounding of individual components on a percentage basis  the revenue decline has been the most pronounced in our high frequency clock and data management product line as unit demand from the networking and telecommunications end markets continued to decline 
for our other product lines  we experienced an increase in unit demand in  however  this was more than offset by decreases in average selling prices  resulting in total revenue declines in approximately  and of our revenues during were derived from the americas  asia pacific and europe including the middle east  respectively  compared to  and  respectively  during the change from prior year reflects the continuing recovery of the asia pacific markets and our growth in the china market 
cost of sales 
cost of sales for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from  million in this decrease is attributable to million of cost reduction activities and million of lower provisions for excess inventories taken during as compared to as of the end of the third quarter of  we completed actions to achieve an estimated million of annual cost of sales savings as compared to our cost structure as of the first quarter of these cost savings were partially offset by an increase in freight expense of million in the second half of as compared to the second half of due to the expiration of the freight sharing agreement with motorola during looking forward  we anticipate additional cost savings from our restructuring programs see recent developments above 
although freight expense in is expected to increase as compared to  since we benefited from the motorola freight sharing agreement during the first half of  we do not expect our freight cost structure in to significantly change from that of the last two quarters of gross profit 
gross profit computed as total revenues less cost of sales for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in as a percentage of total revenues  gross margin increased to during from in to summarize the fluctuations described above  the increase in gross margin was attributable to cost improvements from restructuring efforts and lower provisions for excess inventories  offset by decreases in average selling prices and an increase in freight expense with the expiration of the freight sharing agreement with motorola 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development costs decreased million  or  to million in compared with million  primarily as a result of aligning our operating costs with our revenues 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development costs remained fairly consistent at in as compared to in our target for research and development costs in is 
table of contents approximately of total revenues as we continue to focus on new product development 
the primary emphasis of our new product development efforts is in the expected high growth market applications of high frequency clock and data management and power management and standard analog solutions  with approximately of our overall research and development investments focused in these areas 
during  we introduced new products 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to million compared with million in as a percentage of revenues  selling and marketing expenses for were compared with in with the decline attributable to our worldwide restructuring programs 
restructuring efforts in selling and marketing  including the downsizing of our sales force  closing of sales offices as well as our regional sales headquarters and centralizing and relocating our order entry functions to lower cost regions  were largely enacted during the second quarter of selling and marketing expenses are targeted at approximately of total revenues in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million from million in  as a result of personnel reductions of approximately as compared to and the relocation of functions to lower cost regions 
as a percentage of revenues  these costs decreased to in from in we expect our general and administrative expenses to sequentially decline until these expenses reach approximately of revenues in the fourth quarter of amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles decreased million to million in from million  as a result of the adoption of sfas effective january   which eliminated the amortization of goodwill see note significant accounting policies of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
restructuring and other 
restructuring and other activity decreased million to million in from million in  as most of our restructuring activities were initiated in we have million accrued in relation to the and programs and expect this amount to be paid over the next year 
we expect that the savings from these programs will more than offset the expected payments in during  we recorded charges of million to cover costs associated with our worldwide profitability enhancement programs 
the charges primarily relate to the consolidation of manufacturing  selling and administrative functions in the us and europe 
the charges included million to cover employee separation costs associated with the termination of approximately employees  asset impairments of million  and million of other costs primarily related to facility closures and contract terminations 
the asset impairments were charged directly against the related assets 
employee separation costs included million of non cash charges associated primarily with the acceleration of vesting of stock options for terminated employees 
as of december   the remaining liability relating to this restructuring was million 
as of december   approximately employees have been terminated under this restructuring plan 
during the second quarter of  we reached a settlement of various contractual issues with motorola in exchange for a cash payment from motorola of million resulting in a related gain of million see note related party transactions for further details of the motorola settlement 
in december  we recorded a million charge to cover costs associated with the separation of two of our executive officers 
in connection with the separation  we reserved million related to the cash portion of the related separation agreements 
in addition  we agreed to modify the vesting and exercise period for a portion of the executives stock options 
this modification resulted in a non cash stock compensation charge of million with an offsetting credit to additional paid in capital 
see note restructuring and other of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a further discussion of these charges 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for from million in the higher interest expense was due to the increased supplemental interest charges of million in as compared to resulting from the august amendments to our senior bank 
table of contents facilities 
the higher interest expense in also reflects a full year of interest on the draw on our revolving credit facility that occurred in june our weighted average interest rate on long term debt including current maturities was per annum and per annum in and  respectively  computed by dividing total interest expense by our average month end debt balances 
at current rates that apply to our senior bank facilities  we expect net interest expense to be approximately million in equity in earnings of joint ventures 
equity in earnings from our joint ventures remained relatively consistent  decreasing million to million in from million in gain on sale of investment in joint venture 
we had a interest in smp 
as a part of the joint venture agreement  our joint venture partner  philips semiconductors international bv philips  had the right to purchase our interest in smp between january and july in february  philips exercised its purchase right  acquiring our interest in smp effective december  this transaction resulted in proceeds of approximately million and a pre tax gain of approximately million 
income tax provision 
we recognized an income tax provision of million in compared with in the provision related to income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations 
the amount was greatly influenced by our decision to limit the recognition of deferred tax benefits relating to our operating losses to the amount that could be recovered via carry back 
this decision resulted in an increase of million in our valuation allowance established for our us tax benefits 
this was partially offset by deferred tax benefits recognized for certain operating losses incurred outside the us minority interests 
minority interests represent the portion of the net loss of our two majority owned czech subsidiaries attributable to the minority owners of each subsidiary

liquidity and capital resources in this section of the management discussion and analysis segment  we are going to discuss sources and uses of cash  and significant factors that influence both  key events affecting our capital structure  our analysis of our cash flows for  and our commitments and contractual obligations 
all of these factors are important to an understanding of our ability to meet our current obligations  to fund working capital  to finance expansion either by internal means or through the acquisition of other businesses  or to pay down existing debt 
to summarize our current status  our operating activities provided cash of million in and million in and used cash of million in at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  net working capital of million  term or revolving debt of  million and a stockholders deficit of million 
our long term debt includes million under our senior bank facilities  million net of discount of our second lien senior secured notes due  million of our senior subordinated notes due  million under a junior subordinated note payable to motorola due  and million under a note payable to a japanese bank due we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our various debt agreements as of december  and expect to remain in compliance over the next twelve months 
sources and uses of cash we require cash to fund our operating expenses  including working capital requirements and outlays for research and development  to make capital expenditures  strategic acquisitions and investments  and to pay debt service  including principal and interest and capital lease payments 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand  cash generated from operations  and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances 
in the near term  we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations  cash and cash equivalents on hand  and targeted asset sales  including our guadalajara  mexico site  which is currently on the market for sale 
additionally  as part of our business strategy  we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities and proposals on a regular basis 
we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include factors that affect our results of operations and cash flows  including reduced demand for our products resulting from the recent economic slowdown and actions taken by our customers to manage their inventories in line with incoming business  competitive pricing pressures  under utilization of our manufacturing capacity  our ability to achieve further reductions in operating expenses  the impact of our restructuring program on our productivity  and our ability to make the research and development expenditures required to remain competitive in our business  and 
table of contents factors that affect our access to bank financing and the debt and equity capital markets that could impair our ability to obtain needed financing on acceptable terms or to respond to business opportunities and developments as they arise including interest rate fluctuations  our ability to maintain compliance with financial covenants and ratios under our existing credit facilities  other limitations imposed by our credit facilities or arising from our substantial leverage  and our move to the nasdaq smallcap market  discussed further herein 
our ability to service our long term debt  to remain in compliance with the various covenants and restrictions contained in our credit agreements and to fund working capital  capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to  among other things  our future operating performance as well as to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other conditions  some of which may beyond our control 
if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations  we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives 
there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or  if available  will be at rates or prices acceptable to us 
although there can be no assurance  we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash balances will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements through december  to the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans  our liquidity may be adversely impacted 
key events affecting our capital structure debt refinancing in on may  we issued million principal amount of second lien senior secured notes due the second lien senior secured notes were issued at a price of of par and will mature on may  the second lien senior secured notes initially accrued interest at a rate of per annum

in connection with the offering of second lien senior secured notes  we amended our senior bank facilities to  among other things  permit the issuance of the second lien senior secured notes  make certain of the financial ratio maintenance requirements thereunder less restrictive and impose minimum ebitda and cash requirements 
see note long term debt of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in each case included elsewhere in this report 
we used million of net cash proceeds from the sale of the second lien senior secured notes to prepay a portion of our senior bank facilities 
because the remaining principal amount of loans outstanding under our senior bank facilities was reduced below million as a result of this refinancing  the supplemental interest charges thereon described in note long term debt of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report were reduced from to 
in connection with this refinancing  we wrote off million of debt issuance costs

we used million of net cash proceeds from the sale of the notes to prepay a portion of our senior bank facilities  including million of which proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility and permanently reduce the commitments thereunder by such amount 
in connection with this refinancing  we wrote off million of debt issuance costs 
issuance of series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock at june   we were not in compliance with minimum interest expense coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio covenants under our senior bank facilities 
on august   we received a waiver in respect of this noncompliance at june  and in respect of any future noncompliance with these covenants through december  in connection with this waiver  we amended our senior bank facilities 
the key terms of this amendment are described in note long term debt of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
as a condition to the waiver and amendment  we were required to obtain million through an equity investment from an affiliate of texas pacific group 
we satisfied this requirement on september   when we issued  shares of series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock to an affiliate of texas pacific group in exchange for million million  net of issuance costs 
the material terms of the preferred stock are summarized in note redeemable preferred stock of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

transfer to nasdaq smallcap market on july   we received a notice from nasdaq advising us that we were not in compliance with the nasdaq national market s minimum bid price requirement marketplace rule b because our 
table of contents common stock had traded below per share for consecutive trading days and that  if we were unable to demonstrate compliance with this requirement by october   nasdaq would provide us written notification that our securities would be delisted 
because our stock had not closed above a share since july   it seemed unlikely that we would have regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
on october  we requested a transfer of the listing of our common stock from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market 
on october  nasdaq approved our transfer and effective october   our common stock began trading on the nasdaq smallcap market 
as the nasdaq smallcap market does not have the same trading volume as the nasdaq national market  our stock may become more volatile and there can be no assurances that a ready market will exist 
movement from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market does not prevent us from issuing additional securities  however  pricing of an offering may be more difficult given the less liquid nature of the nasdaq smallcap market 
if later we are able to meet the applicable listing requirements of the nasdaq national market once again  we may apply to list our common stock on the nasdaq national market

the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   shows an improvement in cash flows from operations of million  a reduction in the net cash used in investing activities of million  and a decrease of million in cash flows from financing activities 
we generated million in cash flow from operations during relative to cash used in operations of million in this million improvement is primarily the result of reduced costs resulting from our restructuring program and reduced restructuring payments 
we used million in net cash from investing activities in as compared to million in the decline was the result of lower capital equipment spending 
our need for incremental property  plant or equipment has been significantly reduced given the current level of business 
furthermore  our senior bank facilities restrict the amount of capital equipment we can purchase within certain periods 
as a result  we have been selective in purchasing new equipment 
financing activities during have resulted in net cash used of million versus net cash provided in of million

in contrast  in we drew on our million revolving credit facility and received net proceeds of million from the issuance of redeemable preferred stock to help fund the cash used in operations and equipment purchases needed at the time

effective january   we changed our accounting method for recognizing revenue on sales to distributors 
recognition of revenue and related gross profit on sales to distributors is now deferred until the distributor resells the product 
in the risk factors set forth below  we have generally restated financial information on a pro forma basis for periods prior to to reflect the change in revenue recognition on sales to distributors 
trends  risks and uncertainties related to our business we have experienced declines in revenues and operating losses  and we may experience additional declines in revenues and operating losses in the future 
our historical financial results have been  and our future financial results are anticipated to be subject to substantial fluctuations 
our total revenues for were  million  compared to  million for and  million in this decline was due primarily to reduced demand for our products resulting from the current economic slowdown and declines in the average selling prices for our products 
we incurred a net loss for of million  compared to a net loss of million for and net income of million in the most recent downturn in our business has been most pronounced with respect to our high frequency clock and data management products 
net revenues from high frequency clock and data management products represented million  million and million  or  and of the total revenues  in  and  respectively 
reduced end user demand  continued price declines  underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and other factors could adversely affect our business in the near term and we may experience additional declines in revenue and operating losses in the future 
in order to return to profitability  we must successfully implement our business plan  including our cost reduction initiatives 
however  we also currently face an environment of uncertain demand and pricing pressure in the markets our products address 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to return to profitability or that we will be able to sustain our profitability  if achieved 

table of contents we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry  which is subject to significant downturns 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical 
the industry has experienced significant downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles for semiconductors and for the end user products in which they are used and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  production overcapacity  high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
we have experienced these conditions in our business in the past  are currently experiencing a significant and prolonged downturn and may experience such downturns in the future 
the most recent downturn  which began in the fourth quarter of  has been severe and prolonged  and it is uncertain when any meaningful recovery will occur 
future downturns in the semiconductor industry may also be severe and prolonged 
future downturns in the semiconductor industry  or any failure of the industry to fully recover from its recent downturn  could seriously impact our revenues and harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
during the s and continuing into  the semiconductor industry enjoyed unprecedented growth  benefiting from the rapid expansion of the internet and other computing and communications technologies 
during  we like many of our customers and competitors were adversely affected by a general economic slowdown and an abrupt decline in demand for many of the end user products that incorporate our integrated circuits and standard semiconductors 
the impact of slowing end customer demand was compounded by higher than normal levels of equipment and component inventories among our original equipment manufacturer  subcontractor and distributor customers  resulting in increasing pricing pressure 
we expect that factors including  but not limited to  economic uncertainty and downturns relating to the threat or actual occurrence of armed international conflict or terrorist attacks  reduced demand for end user products  underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and changes in our revenue mix could adversely impact our operating results in the near term 
our gross margin is dependent on a number of factors  including our level of capacity utilization 
semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment  leading to high fixed costs  including depreciation expense 
if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and testing facilities at a high level  the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed  resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins 
the decline in product orders and shipments in resulted in reduced capacity utilization of our facilities as we have attempted to match production with anticipated customer demand 
from to  gross margins declined primarily due to lower factory utilization resulting from lower customer demand  lower selling prices  and a change in product mix towards lower margin devices  partially offset by cost reduction initiatives 
as a percentage of total revenues  gross margin was for  compared to for and in although our gross margin has improved between and  gross margin declined between the third and fourth quarters of and we anticipate a further decline of to basis points in the first quarter of as a result of pricing pressure 
increased competition and other factors may lead to further price erosion  lower revenues and lower margins for us in the future 
the failure to implement  as well as the completion and impact of  our profitability enhancement programs and cost reductions could adversely affect our business 
during  and  we implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives in response to the significant downturn in our industry 
these initiatives have included accelerating our manufacturing moves into lower cost regions  transitioning higher cost external supply to internal manufacturing  working with our material suppliers to further lower costs  personnel reductions  reductions in employee compensation  temporary shutdowns of facilities with mandatory vacation and aggressively streamlining our overhead 
however  we cannot assure you that these cost reduction initiatives will  in and of themselves  return us to profitability 
we recorded restructuring charges of million in  million in and million in to cover costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives 
these costs were primarily comprised of employee separation costs and asset impairments 
the impact of these restructuring actions on our ability to effectively compete is subject to risks and uncertainties 
because our restructuring activities involve changes to 
table of contents many aspects of our business  the cost reductions could adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated 
even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings  there may be other unforeseeable factors that could adversely impact our profitability and business 
if we are unable to implement our business strategy  our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 
our future financial performance and success are largely dependent on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully 
our present business strategy to build upon our position as a global supplier of power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components includes  without limitation  plans to maintain and refine our product portfolio  continue to develop leading edge customer support services  expand further our just in time delivery capabilities  increase our die manufacturing capacity in a cost effective manner  reduce further the number of our product platforms and process flows  continue to manage our existing portfolio of products aggressively  rationalize our manufacturing operations  relocate manufacturing operations or outsource to lower cost regions  reduce selling and administrative expenses  reduce capital expenditures  actively manage working capital  develop new products in a more efficient manner  and focus on the development of power management and standard analog and high frequency clock and data management products 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business strategy or that implementing our strategy will sustain or improve our results of operations 
in particular  we cannot assure you that we will be able to build our position in markets with high growth potential  increase our volume or revenue  rationalize our manufacturing operations or reduce our costs and expenses 
our business strategy is based on our assumptions about the future demand for our current products and the new products and applications we are developing and on our ability to produce our products profitably 
each of these factors depends on our ability  among other things  to finance our operating and product development activities  maintain high quality and efficient manufacturing operations  relocate and close manufacturing facilities and reduce operating expenses as part of our ongoing cost restructuring with minimal disruption to our operations  access quality raw materials and contract manufacturing services in a cost effective and timely manner  protect our intellectual property portfolio and attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing and finance personnel 
several of these and other factors that could affect our ability to implement our business strategy  such as risks associated with international operations  the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict and terrorist activities  increased competition  legal developments and general economic conditions  are beyond our control 
in addition  circumstances beyond our control and changes in our business or industry may require us to change our business strategy 
we may require additional capital in the future  and additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  together with the cash that we expect to generate from our operations and sales of assets in the ordinary course of business  will be sufficient to meet our planned capital needs for however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional capital to fund our future activities or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
as of december  we have million of borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility 
subject to the restrictions contained in our senior bank facilities and the indentures governing the notes  our second lien senior secured notes due and our senior subordinated notes due  we may be able to raise these funds by selling securities to the public or selected investors  or by borrowing money 
the transfer of our common stock from the nasdaq national market system to the nasdaq smallcap market  which was effective as of october   may make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling securities 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our operations significantly  reduce planned capital expenditures and research and development  make selective dispositions of our assets or obtain funds through arrangements with strategic partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies or potential markets  or otherwise impair our ability to remain competitive 

table of contents we may be unable to make the substantial research and development investments required to remain competitive in our business 
the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products 
we are committed to maintaining spending on new product development in order to stay competitive in our markets 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive 
the primary emphasis of our new product development is in the power management and standard analog and high frequency clock and data management solutions  with of our overall research and development investment targeted in these areas 
our long term target for research and development expenditures is of our total revenues 
uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of  and payment for  our products could adversely affect our business 
our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders and we generally do not have long term supply arrangements with our customers 
generally  our terms and conditions allow our customers to cancel orders up to days prior to shipment 
we routinely purchase inventory based on customers estimates of demand for their products  which is difficult to predict 
this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to original equipment manufacturers indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers  or both  as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties 
in addition  our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason 
the cancellation or deferral of product orders  the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess obsolete inventory  which could result in write downs of inventory or the incurrence of significant cancellation penalties under our arrangements with our raw materials and equipment suppliers 
during  the markets in which our customers operate were characterized by a dramatic decline in end user demand and continued high levels of channel inventories  which reduced visibility of future demand for our products and  in some cases  led to delays in payments for our products 
in  short customer lead times prevail given the over capacity in the industry  and we believe that these and other factors could adversely affect our revenues in the near term 
an inability to introduce new products could adversely affect us  and changing technologies or consumption patterns could reduce the demand for our products 
rapidly changing technologies and industry standards  along with frequent new product introductions  characterize the industries that are currently the primary end users of semiconductors 
as these industries evolve and introduce new products  our success will depend on our ability to predict and adapt to these changes in a timely and cost effective manner by designing  developing  manufacturing  marketing and providing customer support for our own new products and technologies 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify changes in the product markets and requirements of our customers and end users and adapt to such changes in a timely and cost effective manner 
nor can we assure you that products or technologies that may be developed in the future by our competitors and others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
a fundamental shift in technologies or consumption patterns in our existing product markets or the product markets of our customers or end users could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 
competition in our industry could prevent us from maintaining our revenues and from raising prices to offset increases in costs 
the semiconductor industry  particularly the market for semiconductor components  is highly competitive 
as a result of the recent economic downturn  competition in the markets in which we operate intensified as manufacturers of semiconductor components offered reduced prices in order to combat production overcapacity and high inventory levels 
although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines  we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches 
in addition  companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future 
the semiconductor 
table of contents components industry has also been undergoing significant restructuring and consolidations that could adversely affect our competitiveness 
many of our competitors may have certain advantages over us  including substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and pursue development  engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products  longer independent operating histories and presence in key markets  patent protection  and greater name recognition 
because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits  we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits  application specific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits  as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products 
we compete in different product lines to various degrees on the basis of price  quality  technical performance  product features  product system compatibility  customized design  strategic relationships with customers  new product innovation  availability  delivery timing and reliability and customer sales and technical support 
gross margins in the industry vary by geographic region depending on local demand for the products in which semiconductors are used  such as personal computers  industrial and telecommunications equipment  consumer electronics and automotive goods 
our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control  including industry and general economic trends 
unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency  our future profitability could be adversely affected 
manufacturing semiconductor components involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment 
we and our competitors continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance 
impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields 
our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future profitability  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 
from time to time  we have experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities  transferring production to other facilities or in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes that have caused us to suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  capacity constraints  construction delays  transferring production to other facilities  upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies  any of which could result in a loss of future revenues 
our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately 
we could be required to incur significant capital expenditures for manufacturing technology and equipment to remain competitive 
semiconductor manufacturing has historically required  and in the future is likely to continue to require  a constant upgrading of process technology to remain competitive  as new and enhanced semiconductor processes are developed which permit smaller  more efficient and more powerful semiconductor devices 
we maintain certain of our own manufacturing  assembly and test facilities  which have required and will continue to require significant investments in manufacturing technology and equipment 
we have made substantial capital expenditures and installed significant production capacity to support new technologies and increased production volume 
we have reduced our capital expenditures from million in to million in and million in capital expenditures are expected to increase to approximately million in we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient capital resources to make necessary investments in manufacturing technology and equipment 
in addition  our principal credit agreement limits the amount of our capital expenditures 

table of contents if we were to lose one of our large customers  our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 
product sales to our ten largest customers accounted in the aggregate for approximately  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
many of our customers operate in cyclical industries  and in the past we have experienced significant fluctuations from period to period in the volume of our products ordered 
generally  our agreements with our customers impose no minimum or continuing obligations to purchase our products 
we cannot assure you that any of our customers will not significantly reduce orders or seek price reductions in the future or that the loss of one or more of our customers would not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 
the loss of our sources of raw materials or manufacturing services  or increases in the prices of such goods or services  could adversely affect our operations and productivity 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if the costs of our raw materials increase significantly or their quality deteriorates 
our manufacturing processes rely on many raw materials  including silicon wafers  copper lead frames  mold compound  ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases 
generally  our agreements with suppliers impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations  and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a just in time basis 
from time to time  suppliers may extend lead times  limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
although we believe that our current supplies of raw materials are adequate  shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 
in addition  for some of our products  such as our new silicon germanium sige technology  we are dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized suppliers for required components and materials 
the number of qualified alternative suppliers for these kinds of technologies is extremely limited 
we cannot assure you that we will not lose our suppliers for these key technologies or that our suppliers will be able to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules 
disruption or termination of our limited supply sources for these components and materials could delay our shipments of products utilizing these technologies and damage relationships with current and prospective customers 
we also use third party contractors for some of our manufacturing activities  primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods 
these contract manufacturers  including hynix  ait  ase and phenitec  accounted for approximately  and of our cost of sales in  and  respectively 
our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts  and in some cases require longer term commitments in the early stages of the relationship 
our operations could be adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated  the cost of such services increased significantly  the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasts proved to be materially incorrect 
in the case of motorola  we agreed to continue providing manufacturing services to each other including motorola s manufacturing of our emitter coupled logic products for limited periods of time following our recapitalization 
under our agreements with motorola  the prices of these services are fixed at levels that are intended to approximate each party s cost of providing the services 
we fulfilled our minimum commitments to purchase manufacturing services from motorola in we could be adversely affected if we are unable to relocate these manufacturing operations to our own facilities or to other third party manufacturers on cost effective terms or make other satisfactory arrangements prior to the time when these agreements expire 
acquisitions and strategic alliances may harm our operating results or cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities or dilute our stockholders 
we may in the future acquire and form strategic alliances relating to other businesses  products and technologies 
successful acquisitions and alliances in the semiconductor industry are difficult to accomplish because they require  among other things  efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts 
the difficulties of integration and alignment may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations  the complexity of the technologies being integrated and aligned and the necessity of 
table of contents integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures 
the integration and alignment of operations following an acquisition or alliance requires the dedication of management resources that may distract attention from the day to day business  and may disrupt key research and development  marketing or sales efforts 
in addition  we may issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions or alliances  which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
we may also incur debt or assume contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions and alliances  which could harm our operating results 
without strategic acquisitions and alliances we may have difficulty meeting future customer product and service requirements 
our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could adversely impact our results of operations 
approximately  and of our total revenues in and  and of our total revenues in were derived from the americas  the asia pacific region and europe including the middle east  respectively 
we maintain significant operations in seremban  malaysia  carmona  the philippines  aizu  japan  leshan  china  roznov  the czech republic  and piestany  the slovak republic 
in addition  we rely on a number of contract manufacturers whose operations are primarily located in the asia pacific region 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming the risks that relate to or arise from operating in international markets 
risks inherent in doing business on an international level include  among others  the following economic and political instability including as a result of the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict or terrorist attacks  changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs  customs  duties and other trade barriers  transportation delays  power supply shortages and shutdowns  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and other labor problems  currency convertibility and repatriation  taxation of our earnings and the earnings of our personnel  and other risks relating to the administration of or changes in  or new interpretations of  the laws  regulations and policies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business 
our activities outside the united states are subject to additional risks associated with fluctuating currency values and exchange rates  hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange 
while our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars  worldwide semiconductor pricing is influenced by currency rate fluctuations 
if we fail to attract and retain highly skilled personnel  our results of operations and competitive position could deteriorate 
our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing and finance personnel 
the market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive 
for example  analog component designers are difficult to attract and retain  and the failure to attract and retain analog component designers could compromise our ability to keep pace with our competitors in the market for analog components 
we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel 
as employee incentives  we issue common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at time of the grant and that are subject to vesting 
recently  our stock price has declined substantially  reducing the effectiveness of these incentives 
loss of the services of  or failure to effectively recruit  qualified personnel  including senior managers and design engineers  could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents we use a significant amount of intellectual property in our business 
some of that intellectual property is currently subject to disputes with third parties  and litigation could arise in the future 
if we are unable to protect the intellectual property we use  our business could be adversely affected 
we rely on patents  trade secrets  trademarks  mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies 
some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications  and we cannot assure you that any of the substantial number of us and foreign patents and pending patent applications that we employ in our business  including those that motorola assigned  licensed or sublicensed to us in connection with our recapitalization  will not lapse or be invalidated  circumvented  challenged  abandoned or licensed to others  the license rights granted by motorola in connection with our recapitalization will provide competitive advantages to us  any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought  any of the trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets  know how or mask works that motorola has assigned  licensed or sublicensed to us in connection with our recapitalization will not lapse or be invalidated  circumvented  challenged  abandoned or licensed to others  or any of our pending or future trademark  copyright  or mask work applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought 
in addition  our competitors or others may develop products or technologies that are similar or superior to our products or technologies  duplicate our products or technologies or design around our protected technologies 
effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable  limited or not applied for in the united states and in foreign countries 
also  we may from time to time in the future be notified of claims that we may be infringing third party patents or other intellectual property rights 
motorola has agreed to indemnify us for a limited period of time with respect to some claims that our activities infringe on the intellectual property rights of others 
if necessary or desirable  we may seek licenses under such patents or intellectual property rights 
however  we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us 
the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technologies we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the technologies 
litigation could cause us to incur significant expense  by adversely affecting sales of the challenged product or technologies and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor 
in the event of an adverse outcome in any such litigation  we may be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use  sale or importation of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop or acquire non infringing technologies  discontinue the use of processes  or obtain licenses to the infringing technologies 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in any such development or acquisition or that any such licenses would be available to us on reasonable terms 
any such development  acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources 
we will also seek to protect our proprietary technologies  including technologies that may not be patented or patentable  in part by confidentiality agreements and  if applicable  inventors rights agreements with our collaborators  advisors  employees and consultants 
we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of our research 

table of contents we are party to securities class action litigation which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 
in july  three stockholder class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against us  certain of our current and former officers and directors and various investment banking firms who acted as underwriters in connection with our initial public offering in may in april  the plaintiffs filed a consolidated  amended complaint that supersedes the individual complaints originally filed 
the amended complaint generally alleges that our offering documents failed to disclose certain underwriting fees and commissions and underwriter tie ins and other arrangements with certain customers of the underwriters that impacted the price of our common stock in the after market 
the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages 
on july   together with other issuer defendants  we filed a collective motion to dismiss the class action lawsuit 
this motion is currently pending  and oral argument was heard on november  on february   as to the claims brought against us under the antifraud provisions of the securities laws  the court dismissed these claims with prejudice 
as to the claims brought under the registration provisions of the securities laws  the court denied the motion to dismiss these claims 
we cannot guarantee that the outcome of these proceedings will be decided in our favor 
we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of this securities litigation 
any conclusion of this litigation in a manner adverse to us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the cost to us of defending the litigation  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
such litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of this litigation could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace 
because the price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile  we can provide no assurance that additional securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future 
environmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our manufacturing operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air and water 
our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health  which  among other things  regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances 
motorola has agreed to indemnify us for environmental and health and safety liabilities related to the conduct or operations of our business or motorola s ownership  occupancy or use of real property occurring prior to the closing of our recapitalization transaction 
we also have purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances 
however  we cannot assure you that such indemnification arrangements and insurance policy will cover all material environmental costs 
in addition  the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities related to events or activities occurring after our recapitalization 
we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations  and any liability for currently known environmental conditions  will not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 
however  we cannot predict changes in environmental or health and safety laws or regulations  the manner in which environmental or health and safety laws or regulations will be enforced  administered or interpreted  our ability to enforce and collect under indemnity agreements and insurance policies relating to environmental liabilities  or the cost of compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws or regulations or the costs associated with any future environmental claims  including the cost of clean up of currently unknown environmental conditions 

table of contents terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington dc on september   or threats or occurrences of international armed conflict or other terrorist activities both in the united states and internationally may affect the markets in which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate and our profitability 
on september  the united states was the target of terrorist attacks of unprecedented scope 
these attacks have led to other acts of terrorism since september  the threat or occurrences of international armed conflict or other terrorist activities both in the united states and internationally may affect the markets in which our common stock trades  the market in which we operate and our profitability 
the terrorist attacks have caused instability in the global financial markets  and contributed to downward pressure on stock prices of united states publicly traded companies  such as ours 
future or threatened terrorist attacks or occurrences of international armed conflict could result in greater economic instability and further depress stock prices  including the price of our common stock 
the september attacks and other terrorist attacks have disrupted the global insurance and reinsurance industries  and we may experience delays in renewing some insurance policies and may not be able to obtain insurance at historical levels on all of our facilities 
future terrorist attacks or occurrences of international armed conflict could affect our domestic and international sales  disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products 
such conflicts and hostilities could directly impact our physical facilities or those of our joint ventures  suppliers or customers  both in the united states and elsewhere 
our primary facilities are located in the united states  malaysia  the philippines  japan  the czech republic and slovakia 
in connection with our joint venture  we also have facilities in china 
in addition  these sorts of activities may make transportation of our supplies and products more difficult or cost prohibitive 
any impairment of our financial performance as a result of terrorist attacks or armed conflict could increase the risk of noncompliance with the financial covenants in our principal credit agreement resulting in events of default and the possible acceleration of our indebtedness 
due to the broad and uncertain effects that terrorist attacks have had on financial and economic markets generally  we cannot provide any reliable measure of the impact that these terrorist attacks have had on our recent financial performance or any estimate as to how these sorts of attacks and activities might affect our future results 
trends  risks and uncertainties relating to our indebtedness our substantial debt could impair our financial condition and adversely affect our ability to operate our business 
we are highly leveraged and have substantial debt service obligations 
as of december   we had total long term indebtedness of  million including current maturities  but excluding unused commitments and interest expense of million for the year ended december  also  we may incur additional debt in the future  subject to certain limitations contained in our debt instruments 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to you  including our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired  a significant portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on our debt  which reduces the funds available to us for our operations  some of our debt is and will continue to be at variable rates of interest  which may result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in market interest rates  our debt agreements contain  and any agreements to refinance our debt likely will contain  financial and restrictive covenants  and our failure to comply with them may result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us  our level of indebtedness will increase our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions  
table of contents our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the semiconductor industry  and our substantial leverage could place us at a competitive disadvantage vis vis our competitors who have less leverage relative to their overall capital structures 
as a condition to the august modifications to the covenants under our senior bank facilities  we agreed to specified increases in the interest rates on our outstanding borrowings and the imposition of supplemental interest charges 
these supplemental interest charges decreased in may because proceeds from the sale of our second lien senior secured notes due were used to reduce total borrowings under our senior bank facilities to below million 
we may incur more debt  which could exacerbate the risks described above 
we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness restrict us from incurring additional indebtedness  but do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so 
if new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries current debt levels  the related risks that we and they now face could intensify 
some of the debt we may incur may be secured by the same collateral securing certain of our existing indebtedness 
the agreements relating to our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations  particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take some actions 
our debt agreements contain  and any future debt agreements may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on among other things  our ability to incur additional debt  including guarantees  incur liens  sell or otherwise dispose of assets  make investments  loans or advances  make some acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations  make capital expenditures  pay dividends  redeem capital stock or make certain other restricted payments or investments  pay dividends from semiconductor components industries  llc to on semiconductor corporation  engage in sale and leaseback transactions  enter into new lines of business  issue some types of preferred stock  and enter into transactions with our affiliates 
in addition  our senior bank facilities require that we maintain or achieve a minimum consolidated ebitda and a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents 
any future debt could contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those that are currently applicable 
our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness  including as a result of events beyond our control  could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition 
if there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately 
we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments  either upon maturity or if accelerated upon an event of default or  if we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control  that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities 
further  if we are unable to repay  
table of contents refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt  the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness 
in addition  any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments  including the notes 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance  which will be affected by a range of economic  competitive and business factors  many of which are outside of our control 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and proceeds from sales of assets in the ordinary course of business to satisfy our debt obligations  we may have to undertake alternative financing plans  such as refinancing or restructuring our debt  selling additional assets  reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital 
the terms of our financing agreements contain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
as of march   million of our million revolving credit facility was available  reflecting outstanding loans of million and outstanding letters of credit of million 
as of january   we amended our primary foreign exchange hedging agreement to provide for termination if at any time the amount available under our revolving credit facility is less than million 
we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible  that any assets could be sold  or  if sold  of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales  or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms  if at all  or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect 
as a result of our debt refinancing in  we expect that our average interest expense will increase by approximately million per year 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations  or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms  would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  as well as on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 
trends  risks and uncertainties related to our common stock fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate  we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability  and unexpected changes may cause us to adjust our operations 
a large portion of our costs are fixed  due in part to our significant sales  research and development and manufacturing costs 
thus  small declines in revenues could negatively affect our operating results in any given quarter 
factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include the timing and size of orders from our customers  including cancellations and reschedulings  the timing of introduction of new products  the gain or loss of significant customers  including as a result of industry consolidation  seasonality in some of our target markets  changes in the mix of products we sell  changes in demand by the end users of our customers products  market acceptance of our current and future products  variability of our customers product life cycles  changes in manufacturing yields or other factors affecting the cost of goods sold  such as the cost and availability of raw materials and the extent of utilization of manufacturing capacity  changes in the prices of our products  which can be affected by the level of our customers and end users demand  technological change  product obsolescence  competition  or other factors  cancellations  changes or delays of deliveries to us by our third party manufacturers  including as a result of the availability of manufacturing capacity and the proposed terms of manufacturing arrangements

holders of our common stock may experience dilution and the price of our common stock may decline as a result of the issuance of stock in the future 
in september  we sold  shares of our series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock to tpg on holdings llc  an affiliate of the texas pacific group 
each share of series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder into approximately  shares of our common stock as of the issue date  excluding shares into which the preferred stock is convertible due to accumulated and unpaid dividends and subject to customary anti dilution adjustments 
under the anti dilution provisions  the conversion price is subject to downward adjustment in the event we issue common stock  or derivative securities entitling the holder to subscribe for or acquire common stock  at a price below the then current conversion price or market price 
holders of series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock are entitled to cumulative dividends  payable quarterly in cash  at a rate of per annum or if greater during the relevant quarterly period  in an amount equal to the value of the dividends that would be paid on our common stock then issuable upon conversion of the series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock  subject to applicable restrictions imposed by our principal credit facility 
in the event dividends are not paid  the dividends will accumulate on a compounded basis and the number of shares of common stock into which the series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock is convertible will increase proportionately 
there is a possibility that the series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock will be converted at a price per share that is less than the then current market price of our common stock 
if this were to occur  it may cause substantial dilution to our existing common stockholders 
additionally  we registered the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock under the securities act for public resale 
therefore  in the event that the series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock is converted  a substantial number of shares of our common stock may be sold into the market  which could decrease the trading price of our common stock and encourage short sales by the selling shareholder or others 
short sales could place further downward pressure on the price of our common stock 
in addition to the series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock  we may issue more stock in the future  which may cause dilution and a decline in the price of our common stock 
our stock price may be volatile  which could result in substantial losses for investors in our securities 
the stock markets in general  and the markets for high technology stocks in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
the market price of the common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors  some of which are beyond our control variations in our quarterly operating results  changes in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance  changes in market valuations of similar companies  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures  capital commitments  new products or product enhancements  loss of a major customer or failure to complete significant transactions  and additions or departures of key personnel 
as of march   the trading price of our common stock since our initial public offering has ranged from a high of on may  to a low of on october  
table of contents tpg  as our principal stockholder  controls our company  which will limit the ability of our other stockholders to influence the outcome of director elections and other matters submitted for a vote of the stockholders 
affiliates of texas pacific group own  shares of our common stock and all of the outstanding shares of series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock 
as of march   these shares represented over of the total voting power of our capital stock 
as a result  texas pacific group  through its affiliates  will be able to elect all of our directors and  as a result  control matters requiring board approval  control matters submitted to a stockholder vote  including mergers and consolidations with third parties and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets  and otherwise control or influence our business direction and policies 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation provides that the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which relate to business combinations with interested stockholders  do not apply to us 
our move to the nasdaq smallcap market from the nasdaq national market could impair the marketability and liquidity of our common stock  impair our ability to raise capital and create other risks for our company 
in july  we received a notice from nasdaq advising us that we were not in compliance with the nasdaq national market s minimum bid price requirement marketplace rule b 
since we did not believe we would regain compliance in a timely manner with the minimum bid price requirement  in october we requested a transfer of the listing of our common stock from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market 
nasdaq approved our transfer and effective october   we began trading on the nasdaq smallcap market 
as the nasdaq smallcap market does not have the same trading volume as the nasdaq national market  our stock may become more volatile and there can be no assurances that a ready market will exist 
certain market makers and analysts may elect not to follow us as a result of our transfer from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market 
movement from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market does not prevent us from issuing additional securities  however  pricing of an offering may be more difficult given the less liquid nature of the nasdaq smallcap market 
provisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent the acquisition of our company  which could decrease the value of our stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions create a board of directors with staggered terms  permit only our board of directors or the chairman on our board of directors to call special meetings of stockholders  establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting  prohibit stockholder action by written consent  authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock  which is preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede a takeover attempt and that our board of directors can create and issue without prior stockholder approval  and require the approval by holders of at least of our outstanding common stock to amend any of these provisions in our certificate of incorporation or bylaws 
although we believe these provisions make a higher third party bid more likely by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors  these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  we utilize derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
at december   our long term debt including current maturities totaled  million 
we have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt  which totaled million 
we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the million outstanding balance on our senior bank facilities due to its variable interest rate pricing  however  from time to time  we have entered into interest rate swaps and an interest rate cap to reduce this exposure 
as of december   we had two interest rate swaps covering million of our variable interest rate debt 
a basis point increase in interest rates would not materially change our expected annual interest expense of million for the next twelve months 
a majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  as a multinational business  we also conduct certain of these activities through transactions denominated in a variety of other currencies 
we use forward foreign currency contracts to hedge firm commitments and reduce our overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on our results of operations and cash flows 
gains and losses on these foreign currency exposures would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments 
this strategy reduces  but does not eliminate  the short term impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
for example  changes in exchange rates may affect the foreign currency sales price of our products and can lead to increases or decreases in sales volume to the extent that the sales price of comparable products of our competitors are less or more than the sales price of our products 
our policy prohibits speculation on financial instruments  trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures  or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure
