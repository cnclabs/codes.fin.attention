c loan income includes net loan fees 
d average balances do not include reallocations from noninterest bearing demand deposits and interest bearing demand deposits into savings deposits which were made for regulatory purposes 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued both interest income and interest expense fell compared to levels primarily as the result of the dramatic decrease in interest rates that began in and continued into earning asset yields  on a tax equivalent basis  declined basis points during to from registered in  after decreasing from in the cost of funds for dropped basis points below costs of  after decreasing basis points from costs of 
average earning assets were  million and average interest bearing liabilities were  million for  basically flat when compared to averages in both components

loan yields fell basis points during to from for after a decline of basis points from the level 
time and demand loan yields fell basis points and the yields on home equity and personal lines of credit declined basis points and basis points  respectively compared to the prior year 
the increase in average loan volumes was not enough to offset the reduced interest income caused by declining yields 
during  the corporation took advantage of the lower interest rate cycle and continued to change the mix of the loan portfolio 
average mortgage loans declined as consumers refinanced their loans at near record levels 
the corporation continued to offer competitive mortgage loans but generally sold them immediately after origination along with the related servicing rights

interest rate changes have a direct impact on prepayment speeds 
as interest rates increase  prepayments tend to decline and average lives of mbs increase 
as interest rates decrease  prepayment speeds tend to increase and average lives of mbs decline and accelerates the amount of premium amortization that is realized  further reducing the yields in current periods 
using computer simulation modeling  the corporation tests the average life and yield volatility first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued of all mbs under various interest rate scenarios on a continuing basis to insure that volatility falls within acceptable limits 
the corporation holds no high risk securities nor does the corporation own any securities of a single issuer exceeding of shareholders equity other than us government and agency securities

net interest margin net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis as a percentage of average earning assets improved to for  a rise of basis points compared to the year to year increase in the margin was due to the cost of funds declining more quickly than asset yields as interest rates fell to historic lows 
continued pressure on net first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued interest income is anticipated by the corporation despite active management of interest rate risk 
the corporation s use of computer simiulation to manage interest rate risk is described in the interest sensitivity section of this discussion

the amount of the provision is determined by management based upon its assessment of the size and quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance in relation to the risks inherent within the loan portfolio 
the provision for credit losses was million in compared to million in and million in the allowance for credit losses was million at december   which represents a ratio of of average loans outstanding  down slightly from the reported at december  net charge offs for rose thousand over levels 
the most significant components of this year to year change were increases in the following categories commercial loans not secured by real estate up million  secured by family real estate up thousand and other loans up thousand 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in commercial real estate loans of thousand and revolving credit loans secured by family real estate of thousand

trust income of million for was flat compared to following a thousand decline from although fee revenue continues to be negatively impacted due to low market values  the enhanced referral programs and integrated growth plans for financial affiliates that have been initiated have helped to offset this trend 
the corporation s continued success in building relationships with commercial clients provides fee based affiliates with additional sales opportunities through the total solutions financial management tsfm process 
this strategy combines products  services and professional staff from the corporation s trust  insurance  financial advisory and banking affiliates and partners them in providing comprehensive financial services offerings

the focus concept results in a systematic approach covering a wide range of personal financial goals including appropriate insurance coverage 
this category should also be favorably impacted by the integration of first commonwealth financial advisors into these advisory models

the period included an increase in income from bank owned life insurance of million compared to  resulting primarily from claim income and the impact of an additional million investment during other income for was million  representing a million decrease compared to which followed a million rise over the million achieved in the decline in other income for resulted from the sale of one of the corporation s branches during which generated a gain of thousand based on the premium on the sale of million of deposits 
the period included million of gains related to the sale of a branch and a block of year mortgages as well as a gain from the termination of a subsidiary s defined benefit pension plan 
other income for also included increases in merchant discount of thousand and interchange income of thousand 
other income for the period included a gain on the sale of fixed assets of thousand and increases in merchant discount of thousand as well as a rise in mac interchange fees of thousand 
total other operating expense for grew million or to million compared to million and million for and respectively 
the increase in other operating expense for was primarily the result of nonrecurring charges for the previously described litigation settlement and corporate restructuring of million and million  respectively 
these restructuring charges resulted from the merger of the corporation s banking subsidiaries  southwest bank and first commonwealth bank  which occurred in october  because of this merger  there was a consolidation of support functions with some staff positions being eliminated 
the personnel within the branches and relationship managers in corporate services continued to serve in the same capacity in order to ensure a smooth transition 
employees whose positions were being eliminated were notified and continued to work in their positions for at least days 
notified employees had the opportunity to seek other positions within the corporation or to receive a separation package based on years of service 
also  related to the merger  the structure of all of the boards of directors and board committees for the corporation was realigned 
as a result of these activities  restructuring charges of million are reported on the income statement for the period 
ongoing savings from the restructuring are anticipated to be million per year 
other charges included during as a part of the restructuring related principally to writing off obsolete signs and supplies due to the name change under one charter and amounted to thousand 
also impacting other operating expense for the period were million of costs incurred principally in the fourth quarter of associated with development of the first commonwealth brand

employee benefit costs rose million or for compared to with the largest increase being hospitalization costs up thousand or 
employee benefit costs increased thousand for compared to the period and included increases in k plan expenses and employee stock ownership plan esop expenses which were partially offset by decreases of hospitalization costs 
the corporation strives to provide quality employee benefits while effectively managing costs 
net occupancy expense increased thousand or to million during compared to million for and million for increases in building insurance  building rental costs and building repairs and maintenance in were only partially offset by declines in most other building expense categories 
furniture and equipment expenses of million for reflected increases of thousand over levels resulting primarily from increases in depreciation on computer software and software maintenance offset in part by reduced equipment lease expense 
the period also included increases in depreciation on computer software and software maintenance compared to computer software depreciation and maintenance increases were principally related to the replacement of software utilized by the corporation s data processing subsidiary to process loan and deposit accounts 
the period was also impacted  as a full year of depreciation as well as maintenance was incurred for systems placed in service during the later part of the new application software has enabled the corporation s banking subsidiary to provide enhanced products and services  including internet banking 
technology advances continue to drive the ability of financial services companies to provide expanded services through traditional channels as well as non traditional and emerging delivery systems to meet the changing needs of our clients 
outside data processing expense fell million for the period to million compared to million for and this category was positively impacted by the conversion of southwest bank from outsourced processing to that provided by a subsidiary of the corporation 
outside data processing costs are managed by the corporation s data processing subsidiary along with management of internal data processing costs 
outsourced data processing needs are evaluated based on technology  efficiency and cost considerations

liquidity liquidity is a measure of the corporation s ability to efficiently meet normal cash flow requirements of both borrowers and depositors 
in the ordinary course of business  funds are generated from deposits primary source and the maturity or repayment of earning assets  such as securities first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity continued and loans 
as an additional secondary source  short term liquidity needs may be provided through the use of overnight federal funds purchased  borrowings through the use of lines available for repurchase agreements  and borrowings from the federal reserve bank 
additionally  the corporation s banking subsidiary is a member of the federal home loan bank and may borrow under overnight and term borrowing arrangements 
the sale of earning assets may also provide an additional source of liquidity 
in addition to the previously described funding sources  the corporation also has the ability to access the capital markets 
liquidity risk stems from the possibility that the corporation may not be able to meet current or future financial obligations  or the corporation may become overly reliant on alternative funding sources 
the corporation maintains a liquidity risk management policy to manage this risk 
this policy identifies the primary sources of liquidity  establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity and quantifies minimum liquidity requirements which comply with regulatory requirements 
the policy also includes a liquidity contingency plan to address funding needs to maintain liquidity under a variety of business conditions 
the corporation s liquidity position is monitored by the asset liability management committee alco 
the corporation s long term liquidity source is a large core deposit base and a strong capital position 
core deposits are the most stable source of liquidity a bank can have due to the long term relationship with a deposit customer 
deposits decreased million in and included decreases in noninterest bearing deposits and time deposits which were partially offset by increases in savings deposits 
non core deposits which are time deposits in denominations of thousand or more represented of total deposits at december  non core deposits decreased by million in and rose million in due in part to changes in public funds balances 
the increase in non core deposits during also included the issuance of brokered time deposits in the amount of million 
although the corporation s primary source of funds remains traditional deposits from within the communities served by its banking subsidiary  future sources of deposits utilized could include the use of brokered time deposits offered outside the corporation s traditional market area 
time deposits of thousand or more at december   and had remaining maturities as follows maturity distribution of large certificates of deposit dollar amounts in thousands amount percent amount percent amount percent remaining maturity months or less over months through months over months through months over months total first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity continued net loans increased million during as commercial loans increased by million and loans to individuals increased by million compared to year end the period reflected decreases of million in residential real estate loans  due in part to the continued runoff of the existing portfolio and sale of new loan production as the corporation continued to change the mix of its loans 
below is a schedule of loans by classification for the five years ended december  loans by classification dollar amounts in thousands amount amount amount amount amount commercial  financial  agricultural and other real estate construction real estate commercial real estate residential loans to individuals net leases gross loans and leases unearned income total loans  and leases net of unearned income an additional source of liquidity is marketable securities that the corporation holds in its investment portfolio 
these securities are classified as securities available for sale 
while the corporation does not have specific intentions to sell these securities  they have been designated as available for sale because they may be sold for the purpose of obtaining future liquidity  for management of interest rate risk or as part of the implementation of tax management strategies 
as of december   securities available for sale had an amortized cost of  million and an approximate fair value of  million 
gross unrealized gains were million and gross unrealized losses were million 
based upon the corporation s historical ability to fund liquidity needs from other sources  the current available for sale portfolio is deemed more than adequate  as the corporation does not anticipate a need to liquidate the investments until maturity 
below is a schedule of the contractual maturity distribution of securities held to maturity and securities available for sale at december  maturity distribution of securities held to maturity dollar amounts in thousands us government agencies and corporations states and political subdivisions other securities total amortized cost weighted average yield within year after but within years after but within years after years total first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity continued maturity distribution of securities available for sale at amortized cost dollar amounts in thousands us treasury  and other us government agencies and corporations states and political subdivisions other securities total amortized cost weighted average yield within year after but within years after but within years over years total yields are calculated on a tax equivalent basis 
interest sensitivity market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates or equity prices 
the corporation s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk results principally from timing differences in the repricing of assets and liabilities  changes in the relationship of rate indices and the potential exercise of free standing or embedded options 
the objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to maintain an appropriate balance between the stable growth of income and the risks associated with maximizing income through interest sensitivity imbalances 
while no single number can accurately described the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income  interest rate sensitivity positions  or gaps  when measured over a variety of time periods  can be informative 
an asset or liability is considered to be interest sensitive if the rate it yields or bears is subject to change within a predetermined time period 
if interest sensitive assets isa exceed interest sensitive liabilities isl during a prescribed time period  a positive gap results 
conversely  when isl exceeds isa during a time period  a negative gap results 
the cumulative gap at the day repricing period was negative in the amount of million or of total assets at december  a positive gap tends to indicate that earnings will be impacted favorably if interest rates rise during the period and negatively when interest rates fall during the time period 
a negative gap tends to indicate that earnings will be affected inversely to interest rate changes 
in other words  as interest rates fall  a negative gap should tend to produce a positive effect on earnings and when interest rates rise  a negative gap should tend to affect earnings negatively 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued interest sensitivity continued the primary components of isa include adjustable rate loans and investments  loan repayments  investment maturities and money market investments 
the primary components of isl include maturing certificates of deposit  money market deposits  savings deposits  now accounts and short term borrowings 
the following table lists the amounts and ratios of assets and liabilities with rates or yields subject to change within the periods indicated as of december  and dollar amounts in thousands days days days cumulative days loans loans investments other interest earning assets total interest sensitive assets certificates of deposits other deposits borrowings total interest sensitive liabilities gap isa isl gap total assets days days days cumulative days loans investments other interest earning assets total interest sensitive assets certificates of deposits other deposits borrowings total interest sensitive liabilities gap isa isl gap total assets first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued interest sensitivity continued although the periodic gap analysis provides management with a method of measuring current interest rate risk  it only measures rate sensitivity at a specific point in time  and as a result may not accurately predict the impact of changes in general levels of interest rates or net interest income 
this is exemplified as the gap analysis shows the corporation s earnings to be negatively impacted by rising rates  but computer modeling indicates that rising rates would have a favorable impact on earnings 
therefore  to more precisely measure the impact of interest rate changes on the corporation s net interest income  management simulates the potential effects of changing interest rates through computer modeling 
the income simulation model used by the corporation captures all assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments  accounting for significant variables that are believed to be affected by interest rates 
these variables include prepayment speeds on mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  cash flows from loans  deposits and investments and balance sheet growth assumptions 
the model also captures embedded options  such as interest rate caps floors or call options  and accounts for changes in rate relationships as various rate indices lead or lag changes in market rates 
the corporation is then better able to implement strategies which would include an acceleration of a deposit rate reduction or lag in a deposit rate increase 
the repricing strategies for loans would be inversely related 
the corporation s asset liability management policy guidelines limit interest rate risk exposure for the succeeding twelve month period 
simulations are prepared under the base case where interest rates remain flat  and most likely case where interest rates are defined using projections of economic factors 
additional simulations are produced estimating the impact on net interest income of a basis point movement upward or a basis point movement downward which cannot result in more than a change or change  respectively  in net interest income when compared to the base case  without board approval and a strategy in place to reduce interest rate risk below the established maximum level 
these policy guidelines were changed from simulating a basis point rise and a basis point decline from the base case which could not result in more than a change in net interest income  either up or down because the probability of interest rates declining by basis points over the next months is not likely 
the analysis at december  indicated that a basis point increase in interest rates would increase net interest income basis points above the base case scenario and a basis point decline in interest rates would decrease net interest income by basis points below the base case scenario  over the next twelve months  both within policy limits 
the corporation s asset liability management committee alco is responsible for the identification  assessment and management of interest rate risk exposure  liquidity  capital adequacy and investment portfolio position 
the primary objective of the alco process is to ensure that the corporation s balance sheet structure maintains prudent levels of risk first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued interest sensitivity continued within the context of currently known and forecasted economic conditions and to establish strategies which provide the corporation with appropriate compensation for the assumption of those risks 
the alco attempts to mitigate interest rate risk through the use of strategies such as asset sales  asset and liability pricing and matched maturity funding 
the alco strategies are established by the corporation s senior management 
the alco continues to evaluate the use of derivative instruments to protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate movements on the values of certain assets and liabilities  although none are being utilized currently 
final loan maturities and rate sensitivities of the loan portfolio excluding consumer installment and mortgage loans and before unearned income at december   were as follows dollar amounts in thousands within one year one to years after years total commercial and industrial financial institutions real estate construction real estate commercial other totals loans at fixed interest rates loans at variable interest rates totals credit review maintaining a high quality loan portfolio is of great importance to the corporation 
the corporation manages the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio through the use of prudent lending policies and procedures and monitors risk through a periodic review process provided by internal auditors  regulatory authorities and our loan review staff 
these reviews include the analysis of credit quality  diversification of industry  compliance to policies and procedures  and an analysis of current economic conditions 
in the management of its credit portfolio  the corporation emphasizes the importance of the collectibility of loans and leases as well as asset and earnings diversification 
the corporation immediately recognizes as a loss all credits judged to be uncollectible and has established an allowance for credit losses that may exist in the portfolio at a point in time  but have not been specifically identified 
the corporation s written lending policy requires certain underwriting standards to be met prior to funding any loan  including requirements for credit analysis  collateral value coverage  documentation and terms 
the first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued credit review continued principal factor used to determine potential borrowers creditworthiness is business cash flows or consumer income available to service debt payments 
secondary sources of repayment  including collateral or guarantees  are frequently obtained 
the lending policy provides limits for individual and bank committees lending authorities 
in addition to the bank loan approval process  requests for borrowing relationships which will exceed one million dollars must also be approved by the corporation s credit committee 
this committee consists of a minimum of three members of the corporation s board of directors 
the corporation has an additional level of approval for credit relationships between thousand and million 
this procedure requires approval of those credits by a committee consisting of senior lenders of the corporation 
commercial and industrial loans are generally granted to small and middle market customers for operating  expansion or asset acquisition purposes 
operating cash flows of the business enterprise are identified as the principal source of repayment  with business assets held as collateral 
collateral margins and loan terms are based upon the purpose and structure of the transaction as set forth in loan policy 
commercial real estate loans are granted for the acquisition or improvement of real property 
generally  commercial real estate loans do not exceed of the appraised value of property pledged to secure the transaction 
repayment of such loans are expected from the operations of the subject real estate and are carefully analyzed prior to approval 
real estate construction loans are granted for the purposes of constructing improvements to real property  both commercial and residential 
on site inspections are conducted by qualified individuals prior to periodic permanent project financing  which is generally committed prior to the commencement of construction financing 
real estate loans secured by family residential housing properties are granted subject to statutory limits in effect for each bank regarding the maximum percentage of appraised value of the mortgaged property

first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued credit review continued the corporation maintains an allowance for credit losses at a level deemed sufficient to absorb losses which are inherent in the loan and lease portfolios at each balance sheet date 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis to ensure that the provision for credit losses has been charged against earnings in an amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level that is appropriate based on management s assessment of probable estimated losses 
the corporation s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses consists of several key elements 
these elements include a specific allowance for primary watch list classified loans  a formula allowance based on historical trends  an additional allowance for special circumstances and an unallocated allowance 
while the corporation consistently applies the following comprehensive methodology and procedure described in note accounting policies  allowance for credit loss methodologies incorporate management s current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio as well as collection probabilities for problem credits 
although management considers the allowance for credit losses to be adequate based on information currently available  additional allowance for credit loss provisions may be necessary due to changes in management estimates and assumptions about asset impairment  information about borrowers that indicate changes in the expected future cash flows or changes in economic conditions 
the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses are significant elements of the corporation s financial statements  therefore management periodically reviews the processes and procedures utilized in determining the allowance for credit losses to identify potential enhancements to these processes including development of additional management information systems to ensure that all relevant factors are appropriately considered in the allowance analysis 
in addition  the corporation maintains a system of internal controls which are independently monitored and tested by internal audit and loan review staff to ensure that the loss estimation model is maintained in accordance with internal policies and procedures as well as generally accepted accounting principals 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued credit review continued since all identified losses are immediately charged off  no portion of the allowance for credit losses is restricted to any individual credit or groups of credits  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all credit losses 
for analytical purposes  the following table sets forth an allocation of the allowance for credit losses at december according to the categories indicated 
management feels the unallocated portion of the reserve is necessary due to the uncertain economic and geo political environment and its impact on a variety of sectors such as health care  lodging and energy

the following table identifies nonperforming loans at december a loan is placed in a nonaccrual status at the time when ultimate collectibility of principal or interest  wholly or partially  is in doubt 
past due loans are those loans which were contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments but are well secured and in the process of collection

nonperforming loan levels at december  decreased million compared to levels as decreases in past due loans and renegotiated loans were slightly offset by an increase in nonaccrual loans 
nonaccrual loans include two significant credits in both periods 
the largest credit million carries an guaranty of us government agency 
while approximately million is expected to be collected in the second quarter of as a sale of the underlying assets is pending  the remaining balance should be resolved early in the third quarter of the second credit  which was million at year end  continues to be resolved through the liquidation of collateral and exercising other remedies 
the balance outstanding at december  for this credit was million 
while the final resolution of this credit is uncertain  management s estimate of the potential loss on this credit is reserved 
past due loans for the period decreased million compared to the corresponding period of and included decreases in all major categories including loans secured by residential real estate down thousand  commercial real estate down thousand and other loans down thousand 
renegotiated loans also fell  decreasing by thousand for the period 
nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans was at december   down from the reported at december  the corporation s loan portfolio continues to be monitored by senior management to identify potential portfolio risks and detect potential credit deterioration in the early stages 
the corporation has a watchlist committee which includes credit workout officers of the bank and meets bi weekly to review watchlist credits for workout progress or deterioration 
loan loss adequacy and the status of significant nonperforming credits are monitored on a quarterly basis by a committee made up of senior officers of the bank and parent company 
these committees were established to provide additional internal monitoring and analysis in addition to that provided by the credit committees of the bank and parent company 
credit risk is mitigated during the loan origination process through the use of sound underwriting policies and collateral requirements and its previously described committee structure 
management also attempts to minimize loan losses by analyzing and modifying collection techniques on a periodic basis 
management believes that the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming loans remained safely within acceptable levels 
capital resources equity capital stood at million at december   a million rise compared to december  dividends declared reduced equity by million during as dividends were increased over first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued capital resources continued levels 
the retained net income of million remained in permanent capital to fund future growth and expansion 
long term debt payments and fair value adjustments to unearned esop shares increased equity by million 
the market value adjustment to securities available for sale increased equity by million in amounts paid to fund the discount on reinvested dividends reduced equity by thousand 
proceeds from the issuance of treasury shares to provide for stock options exercised increased equity by million during  while the tax benefit related to the stock options  increased equity by thousand 
a capital base can be considered adequate when it enables the corporation to intermediate funds responsibly and provide related services while protecting against future uncertainties 
the evaluation of capital adequacy depends on a variety of factors  including asset quality  liquidity  earnings history and prospects  internal controls and management caliber 
in consideration of these factors  management s primary emphasis with respect to the corporation s capital position is to maintain an adequate and stable ratio of equity to assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for an analysis of regulatory capital guidelines and the corporation s capital ratios relative to these measurement standards 
risk management in the normal course of business the corporation assumes various types of risk 
the corporation has identified twenty six standard risks which have been summarized into seven major risk categories 
the seven major risk categories include credit risk  market risk  liquidity risk  compliance legal risk  operational risk  reputation risk and strategic risk 
credit risk  market risk and liquidity risk are discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section 
the remaining major risk categories are defined as follows compliance legal risk arises from violations of  or non compliance with laws  rules  regulations  prescribed practices  or ethical standards  operational risk threat created by inadequate information systems  operational problems  weak internal control systems  fraud  or any other unforeseen catastrophes  reputation risk the risk to earnings or capital arising from negative public opinion  and strategic risk this risk arises from adverse business decisions or improper implementation of those decisions 
these factors and others could impact the corporation s business  financial condition and results of operation 
corporate management has taken strong and wide ranging actions to enhance the awareness of and proactively manage risk within the corporation 
in addition to establishing a comprehensive policy and procedure manual that is updated and regularly communicated throughout the corporation  the senior vice president  risk management  an executive officer level position  oversees all aspects of the risk process 
our committee structure embraces a risk management culture  which begins with the risk committee that provides oversight and monitoring of key risk areas 
the first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued risk management continued risk committee  which is chaired by the senior vice president  risk management  and has representation from all of the disciplines across the organization  meets to discuss and assess current risks and emerging risks as well as to identify solutions and mitigants 
credit quality and loan loss adequacy issues are addressed by the credit quality  watch list and loan loss reserve committees 
additional committees include security which is responsible for coordinating the security program  privacy which focuses on safeguarding client information  alco which monitors interest rate and liquidity risks and disclosure which evaluates internal controls regarding information utilized in certain regulatory reports as well as reviewing those reports and the disclosure process to ensure that disclosures are timely  complete and accurate 
the risk department has specific procedures to analyze and quantify risks in the seven major risk categories 
gaps between inherent risks and mitigants are quantified and reviewed by the risk committee  while management continually reviews the mitigants and controls to ensure their continuity with internal audit validating their existence and effectiveness 
risk gaps are compiled to develop a risk rating  which is incorporated into the balanced scorecard measure and is reported to the board of directors 
an analytical review of key indicators  both monetary and non monetary  as well as other current information that may become available through discussions with management serves as an early warning system to detect potential deteriorating internal controls 
all new initiatives and products are subject to a risk assessment prior to being presented for implementation 
an annual assessment of risk is also performed to identify potential threat areas to our computer systems 
our internal audit staff performs routine and consistent information technology reviews of identified risk areas  security measures  and control processes 
in addition  the corporation annually retains outside experts to test potential high risk areas such as internet based processes 
with these processes in place the corporation believes that its objective of establishing a risk culture that identifies  measures  controls and monitors events or actions that may adversely affect our organization has been achieved 
our goal is not to eliminate risk but to understand fully the risk the corporation is assuming and appropriately manage those risks 
inflation and changing prices management is aware of the impact inflation has on interest rates and therefore the impact it can have on a bank s performance 
the ability of a financial institution to cope with inflation can only be determined by analyzing and monitoring its asset and liability structure 
the corporation monitors its asset and liability position with particular emphasis on the mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to reduce the effect of inflation upon its performance 
however  it must be remembered that the asset and liability structure of a financial first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued inflation and changing prices continued institution is substantially different from an industrial corporation in that virtually all assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  meaning that they have been or will be converted into a fixed number of dollars regardless of changes in general price levels 
examples of monetary items include cash  loans and deposits 
nonmonetary items are those assets and liabilities which do not gain or lose purchasing power solely as a result of general price level changes 
examples of nonmonetary items are premises and equipment 
inflation can have a more direct impact on categories of noninterest expenses such as salaries and wages  supplies and employee benefit costs 
these expenses are very closely monitored by management for both the effects of inflation and increases relating to such items as staffing levels  usage of supplies and occupancy costs
