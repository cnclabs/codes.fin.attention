index to financial statements overview teletouch is a leading provider of wireless telecommunications services  primarily paging services  in non major metropolitan areas and communities in the southeast united states 
as of may  the company had approximately  pagers in service 
the company derives the majority of its revenues from fixed  periodic fees  not dependent on usage  charged to subscribers for paging services 
as long as a subscriber remains on service  operating results benefit from the recurring payments of the fixed  periodic fees without incurring additional selling expenses or other fixed costs 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon teletouch s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  teletouch evaluates its estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to those related to the impairment of long lived assets  reserves for doubtful accounts  revenue recognition and certain accrued liabilities 
teletouch bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets teletouch evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its long lived assets and certain intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from such assets 
in assessing the recoverability of these assets  teletouch must project estimated cash flows which are based on various operating assumptions such as average revenue per unit in service  disconnect rates  sales productivity ratios and expenses 
management develops these cash flow projections on a periodic basis and reviews the projections based on actual operating trends 
the projections assume that general economic conditions will continue unchanged throughout the projection period and that their potential impact on capital spending and revenues will not fluctuate 
projected revenues are based on the company s estimate of units in service and average revenue per unit  as well as revenue from various new product initiatives 
projected revenues assume a continued decline in traditional messaging units in service throughout the projection period  which is partially offset by growth of advanced messaging units in service and revenue from the new product initiatives 
projected operating expenses are based upon historic experience and expected market conditions adjusted to reflect an expected decrease in expenses resulting from cost saving initiatives 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company determined that the remaining net book value of its long lived assets was substantially impaired and the recovery of such amounts through future operations or disposition was unlikely 
accordingly  management estimated the future discounted cash flows and determined the goodwill and fcc licenses were significantly impaired and therefore recorded a charge equal to the remaining net book value of these assets of million 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company restructured its operations and exited its retail distribution channel by closing all but of its retail locations 
the company restructured the operations of other retail stores to serve as service centers to provide customer service to its existing customer base 
as a result of the closure of its retail stores  the company identified excess furniture and fixtures and computer 
table of contents 
index to financial statements equipment used previously in its retail business and is actively trying to sell these assets 
teletouch classified these excess assets as assets held for sale and has recorded a charge to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their estimated recoverable value less any anticipated disposition costs 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company reduced the carrying value of these assets now classified as assets held for sale from million to million by recording a charge of million to restructuring expense 
teletouch is actively marketing these assets to various potential buyers  including its resellers and other customers 
at may   the company has less than million of these assets held for sale remaining which are expected to be sold during the first half of fiscal teletouch s review of the carrying value of its long lived assets at may  indicates that the carrying value of these assets is recoverable through future estimated cash flows 
if the cash flow estimates  or the significant operating assumptions upon which they are based  change in the future  teletouch may be required to record additional impairment charges related to its long lived assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts estimates are used in determining the reserve for doubtful accounts and are based on historic collection experience  current trends and a percentage of the accounts receivable aging categories 
in determining these percentages teletouch reviews historical write offs  including comparisons of write offs to provisions for doubtful accounts and as a percentage of revenues  teletouch compares the ratio of the reserve to gross receivables to historic levels and teletouch monitors collections amounts and statistics 
teletouch s allowance for doubtful accounts was million at may  while write offs of customer accounts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  management cannot guarantee that teletouch will continue to experience the same write off rates that it has in the past which could result in material differences in the reserve for doubtful accounts and related provisions for write offs 
reserve for inventory obsolescence estimates are used in determining the reserve for inventory obsolescence and are based on sales trends  a ratio of inventory to revenue  and a review of specific categories of inventory 
in establishing its reserve  teletouch reviews historic inventory obsolescence experience including comparisons of previous write offs to provision for inventory obsolescence and the inventory count compared to recent sales trends 
teletouch s reserve for inventory obsolescence was million at may  while inventory obsolescence has historically been within our expectations and the provision established  management cannot guarantee that teletouch will continue to experience the same obsolescence rates that it has in the past which could result in material differences in the reserve for inventory obsolescence and the related inventory write offs 
revenue recognition teletouch s revenue consists primarily of monthly service and lease revenues charged to customers on a monthly  quarterly  semi annual or annual basis 
revenue also includes sales of messaging devices  cellular telephones  and other products directly to customers and resellers 
teletouch recognizes revenue over the period the service is performed in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
teletouch believes  relative to sales of one way messaging equipment  that all of these conditions are met  and since service is deemed not to be essential to the sale of the equipment  product revenue is recognized at the time of shipment revenue from sale of other products is recognized upon delivery

results of operations for the fiscal years ended may   and total revenue changes in teletouch s total revenue are shown in the table below twelve months ended may  twelve months ended may  change change service  rent and maintenance revenue product sales revenue gross revenue service  rent and maintenance revenue service  rent and maintenance revenues declined due to losses in paging and messaging revenues of million in fiscal year from fiscal year and million in fiscal year from fiscal year this resulted from fewer pagers in service and lower demand for one way paging 
pagers in service decreased to approximately  at may  as compared to  and  at may  and may  respectively  due to a continuing decline in the demand for one way paging service 
the negative impact on service revenues due to the decrease in pagers in service was partially offset by an increase in average revenue per unit arpu for the year ended may  arpu for the year ended may  was as compared to and for the years ended may  and may   respectively 
the increase in arpu is due to the company s ability to maintain the level of its highest arpu business customer base year over year while its lower arpu reseller customer base continued to decline 
the decrease in the company s reseller customer base is expected to continue much like the declines experienced in the company s retail paging subscriber base over the past couple of years 
teletouch expects that the new telemetry products and service revenues will partially offset the loss in paging subscribers and the related recurring revenues and result in a slower decline in total revenue during fiscal arpu is defined as average revenue per unit 
teletouch presents arpu because its management uses the measure to evaluate the company s performance and to allocate resources 
in addition  teletouch believes arpu is a measure of performance used by some commercial banks  investment banks  investors  analysts and others to make informed investment decisions 
arpu is not a measure of financial performance under 
table of contents 
index to financial statements generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 
product sales revenue the decline in product sale revenues was due primarily to the company s exit from the retail business in november which resulted in a decline in cellular revenues of million compounded by a decline in pager equipment sales for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year cellular product sale revenues increased million in fiscal year over fiscal year due to an increased marketing of our cellular products and the company entered an agreement with leap wireless cricket which allowed teletouch to offer a prepaid cellular product to its retail customers 
this increase in revenue was offset by a decrease in pager equipment sales in fiscal year from fiscal year the decline in pager equipment revenues is due to the continued decline in the demand for paging service primarily in the consumer and wholesale markets 
operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization the comparability of operating  selling and general and administrative expenses for the fiscal and periods is affected by the inclusion in the fiscal amounts of certain restructuring costs relating to the company s closing of retail stores

table of contents 
index to financial statements insurance expense of million related to fewer retail stores and lower sales 
bad debt expense also declined million from fiscal year over fiscal year resulting primarily from the decline in the company s retail paging subscriber base along with increased collections efforts 
in addition  third party airtime expense declined million due to better rates negotiated by the company combined with lower use as a result of the decline in the company s retail paging subscriber base 
offsetting these declines was an increase in certain restructuring costs of million related to the closing of retail stores 
in may  the company completed a review of the financial performance of its retail stores 
this review resulted in the decision to close of the company s locations 
provisions for estimated losses on the abandonment of certain leased retail space were  and the loss recorded on the abandonment of related leasehold improvement costs was  as of may  and these charges were included in the operating expense of the company during fiscal after completing the retail exit plan discussed in item restructuring activities and during the quarter ending february   the company increased its provision for losses for certain changes in estimates related to the company s retail exit plan including  for personnel related costs and  for lease obligations 
quarter end november  charges related to the company s retail exit plan included  for the abandonment of certain leased retail space   for the abandonment of related leasehold improvements   for personnel related costs and  for write downs on excess furniture and fixtures and computer equipment held for sale 
such charges have been included in operating expenses in the company s consolidated statement of operations

table of contents 
index to financial statements the decline in operating  selling and general and administrative expenses for the year ended may  as compared to the year ended may   reflects declines in bad debt expense of million resulting primarily from the decline in the company s retail paging subscriber base along with increased collections efforts  a decrease in advertising expense of million  a decrease in telephone expense of million due to savings on a new long distance contract and a decrease in payroll and commission expense of million as a result of the reduction in number of retail stores and lower sales volume in fiscal year additionally  the company reduced third party paging service charges by million and reduced its billing costs by million from fiscal year these decreases in expenses were partially offset by increases in professional fees of million  tower rents of million  insurance expense of million and maintenance and repairs of buildings and equipment of million 
operating costs as a percentage of total revenue have increased while the company s paging subscriber base continues to decline for the year ended may  as compared to the same period in fiscal year and fiscal year the company has a relatively fixed cost structure related to maintaining its paging network 
as paging subscribers and the related recurring revenues continue to decline  operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue will continue to increase until the company is able to generate sufficient revenue growth in its other product and service offerings 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million in fiscal year from million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
these declines are due primarily to the write off certain fixed and intangible assets during the past three years 
the decline in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal year is due primarily to a write off of certain paging infrastructure equipment of million  write downs on excess furniture  fixtures and computer equipment held for sale of million  and charges to write off leasehold improvements relating to store closings of million 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal was due primarily to the company writing off all of its intangible assets  primarily purchased goodwill and fcc licenses  by recording a charge equaling the remaining book value of these assets of million in may see footnote a in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
write off of equipment during the second quarter of fiscal  the company completed verification procedures of its property  plant and equipment 
as a result of the procedures performed  certain paging infrastructure equipment was not identified 
the company believes that a significant amount of the equipment not identified is attributable to ongoing significant repair and upgrades of its network performed on its paging infrastructure over the past seven years without always accurately accounting for the replacement or removal of capitalizable infrastructure equipment 
during prior periods  the removal of certain equipment during the maintenance process was not recorded 
due to the seven year time period over which this activity likely took place it is impractical for the company to accurately attribute this loss to the period in which it occurred  therefore  the company recorded a charge of approximately  during the second quarter of fiscal to write off the remaining carrying value of this equipment 
the company believes that the amount of the loss attributable to any prior year is not significant to any prior annual operating results or financial position 
interest expense net interest expense decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal  which decreased from million in fiscal the decline in interest expense in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  is directly attributable to the company s successful restructuring of the senior and junior subordinated debt on may  which resulted in the company extinguishing approximately million in unpaid principal and accrued interest in exchange for approximately million in cash and the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements delivery of a new promissory note in the amount of million and certain other securities 
interest expense decreased in fiscal over fiscal partly due to the successful completion of the company s debt reorganization as well as decreases in the variable interest rates on the credit agreement 
income taxes the company s net operating loss carryforwards were reduced to at may  from approximately million at may  other deferred tax assets were reduced as well 
this reduction occurred in accordance with the attribute reduction rules of internal revenue code section related to the company s debt restructuring 
a corresponding reduction to the valuation allowance previously recorded against these assets was also recorded and the valuation allowance as of may  was financial condition teletouch s cash balance was million at may  as compared to million at may  cash provided by operating activities decreased to million in fiscal year from million and million in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by operations during fiscal year was primarily due to the continued decline in paging and messaging service revenue 
the increase in cash provided by operations during fiscal year was primarily due to the company ceasing interest payments on the credit agreement in june during the continued negotiations with the lenders to reorganize this senior debt instrument 
the company was successful in restructuring its senior debt in may by paying its senior lenders an aggregate cash amount of approximately  and delivering a new promissory note to one of the original senior lenders in the amount of  discussed below under senior debt reorganization 
additionally  pursuant to the restructuring agreement dated may  by and among tll partners  gm holdings and teletouch  the two holders of the company s junior subordinate notes reached an agreement that released and discharged teletouch of its junior debt obligations without recourse 
gm holdings forgave teletouch s debt obligations totaling  including accrued interest and tll partners forgave teletouch s debt obligations totaling  the company expects that cash flow provided from operations  together with the company s existing credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund its working capital needs in fiscal teletouch s operations require capital investment to purchase pagers for lease to customers and to acquire paging infrastructure equipment to support the company s existing subscribers 
net capital expenditures  including pagers  amounted to million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal from fiscal and fiscal was due to less capital spending on opening new retail stores as well as the company s ability to continue to purchase lower cost pagers to lease to customers 
teletouch anticipates that capital expenditures will remain flat in fiscal as the company plans to only replace necessary equipment to maintain the paging infrastructure while continuing to purchase an adequate supply of pagers to lease to customers 
teletouch will pay for these expenditures with cash generated from operations 
under the company s credit agreements with first community financial corporation and tll partners  the company has available borrowings of million of which million was funded as of may
