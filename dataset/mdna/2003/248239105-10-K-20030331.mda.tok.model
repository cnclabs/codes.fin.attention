our revenues and operating profits by geographic areas are shown in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates securities and exchange commission financial reporting release  requires companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both very important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations  and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
the company believes its critical accounting policies to be revenue recognition  accounting for restructuring and impairments and income taxes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the area of revenue recognition requires the company s management to make significant judgments and estimates 
aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  governs revenue recognition for arrangements that include software  which is more than incidental to the arrangement 
under sop  if a sale of software includes services that are essential to the functionality of the software  then the entire arrangement is to be accounted for using contract accounting as described in accounting research bulletin  long term construction type contracts and sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the determination of whether or not services are essential to the functionality of the software can differ from arrangement to arrangement  and requires the use of significant judgment by management 
factors used in determining whether or not services are essential to the functionality may include whether or not physical changes are being made to the software s underlying source code  the complexity of software configuration services  the level of effort required to build interfaces  the overall relationship of the service fees to the license fees  the length of time expected to complete the services and whether or not the services can be obtained by a customer from their internal resources or another third party vendor 
if services are not considered to be essential to the software  sop generally allows companies to recognize revenue for software licenses upon delivery of the licenses  prior to configuration or implementation services  provided that the other requirements of the sop are met 
in management s judgment  the company s configuration and implementation services generally are essential to the functionality of its software 
therefore  the company typically recognizes revenues using the percentage of completion method as detailed in sop the company s arrangements are segmented  in accordance with sop  into two primary elements or profit centers  one being the license fee and implementation service element and the other being an ongoing sales force support services element 
the company believes that its arrangements meet all of the criteria under sop to allow for the segmentation of the two elements 
if the segmentation criteria could not be met  it would result in recognition of the company s license and implementation service revenues over the term of its multi year support service agreements 
the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition requires management to use significant estimates in measuring the progress to completion for each project 
for its license fee and implementation service projects  the company uses the input measure of labor incurred as compared with total expected labor for the entire project 
the determination of total project labor requires the use of significant judgment and estimates 
we review these estimates on a monthly basis 
actual results could differ from these estimates  which would have impacted the amount of revenue previously recognized  had better estimates been available at the time 
accounting for restructuring during  the company recognized costs in connection with a restructuring plan which involved a reduction in size of the company s work force  downsizing of certain facilities and relocation of certain activities 
the restructuring related costs were based upon formal plans approved by the company s management using the information available at the time 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the restructuring and related charges 
accounting for impairments we review long lived assets other than goodwill and capitalized software development costs for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the recoverability of the long lived assets by estimating future undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the long lived asset 
if this estimate of future undiscounted cash flows demonstrates that recoverability is not probable  an impairment loss would be calculated and recognized 
an impairment loss would be calculated based on the excess carrying amount of the long lived asset over the long lived asset s fair value 
the estimate of the fair value and the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying long lived assets are based on significant judgment and assumptions 
we review capitalized software development costs and purchased capitalized development software costs for impairment at each balance sheet date to determine if the unamortized capitalized costs of a computer software product is greater than the net realizable value of that product 
in those instances where the unamortized capitalized costs are greater than the net realizable value  we will record an impairment 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles on an annual basis october of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
on an annual basis or when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other identified intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill step one of the required test 
if the carrying value exceeds fair value  we would perform step two of the required test and record the impairment charge in our statement of operations 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  all of which require significant management judgments 
realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income of a correct character prior to the expiration of the loss carryforwards  capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards 
although realization is not assured  management currently believes it is more likely than not that the recorded net deferred tax asset will be realized  however  the asset could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
mergers and acquisitions we regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire products or businesses that represent strategic enhancements to our operations 
such acquisition opportunities  if they arise  may involve the use of cash or equity instruments 
the company has made the following acquisitions over the last three years software associates international on september   the company acquired software associates international sai  a privately held company based in new jersey 
sai provided software products and solutions that enabled corporate level sales and marketing analysis for pharmaceutical companies 
these solutions are complementary to the company s core suite of business products 
the results of sai s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date 
the aggregate purchase price was approximately  which included cash of approximately  accrued professional service fees of approximately  and options to purchase dendrite common stock valued at approximately  the fair value of the stock options was estimated using the black scholes valuation model 
the company is in the process of finalizing a third party valuation of certain intangible assets and its evaluation of acquired facilities and personnel for redundancy  and therefore  the purchase price allocation is preliminary and subject to adjustment 
the company recorded  of goodwill and  of acquired intangible assets  of which approximately  was assigned to registered trademarks that are not subject to amortization 
the remaining  of acquired intangible assets includes purchased software development costs of approximately  approximately  of non compete agreements and approximately  of customer relationship assets 
in connection with the acquisition of sai  the company developed an exit plan 
the exit plan consisted of closing a facility in mt 
arlington  new jersey and relocating the operations to the company s other facilities in new jersey 
the company accrued as part of the acquisition costs the costs to terminate certain leases amounting to  the company anticipates finalizing the close of the facility during the first quarter of pharma vision on august   the company acquired pharma vision for cash consideration of approximately  which included approximately  of professional service fees 
pharma vision collected and sold data for customer targeting that pharmaceutical representatives use in europe and provided support to pharmaceutical customers in belgium and the netherlands 
the results of pharma vision s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
analytika on january   the company purchased all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of analytika  inc analytika  a provider of advanced analytical products  consulting services and outsourced operations services to the pharmaceutical industry 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  the company paid  in cash  which included transaction costs  and dendrite common stock valued at  the acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method with the purchase price allocated to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair market values at the acquisition date 
of the purchase price   was allocated to purchased capitalized software development costs 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill  based upon a third party valuation 
analytika s results of operations have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated year ended december revenues license fees services costs of revenues cost of license fees purchased software impairment cost of services gross margin operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development restructuring charge asset impairments operating income loss interest and other income income loss before income taxes income tax benefit expense net income loss the discussion of our results in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes and  where so indicated  excludes  the impact of the restructure and asset impairment charges and other non comparable items 
in discussing its period to period results  the company believes it is useful  for investors and management  in reviewing financial performance  to understand the impact on operating results and financial condition including on a comparative basis of actions  events and items which the company believes are not normally part of its operations or are otherwise unusual events 
it supplements  and is not intended to represent  gaap presentation 
years ended december  and revenues 
total revenues decreased  to  in  down from  in license fee revenues decreased  to  in  down from  in license fee revenues as a percentage of total revenues were in as compared to in license fees are  by nature  non recurring items and fluctuate from year to year 
the majority of license fee revenue recognized during the year ended december  related to sales to new clients as well as purchases of additional user licenses by existing customers who increased the size of their sales forces 
the decrease in license fee revenues from to was primarily due to fewer software upgrades by existing customers in as compared to license fee revenues increased during the fourth quarter of by from the fourth quarter of and from the third quarter of this increase was caused by both additional user purchases by a large existing customer as well as a sale to a new customer 
service revenues increased  to  in  up from  in service revenues as a percentage of total revenues were in as compared to in the company s results reflected growth in technical and hardware support services and international operations offset by a decrease in its domestic sales support services of approximately compared to the decrease in domestic sales support services was primarily attributable to the roll off of a large customer 
service revenues were atypically high in the fourth quarter of this was a result of our largest customer completing a major rollout for their entire user base during the fourth quarter of the rollout resulted in significant increases in the services rendered to our customers for initial training and peak period hardware and help desk support 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues decreased  to  in  down from  in cost of license fees decreased  to  in  down from  in cost of license fees for the year ended december  is comprised of the amortization of capitalized software development costs of  and third party vendor license fees of  cost of license fees for the year ended december  is comprised of the amortization of purchased software and capitalized software development costs of  and third party vendor license fees of  the decrease in the amortization of capitalized software development costs in the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the company entering into a new product strategy in which resulted in accelerated amortization of the remaining purchased capitalized software by the end of the new strategy called for the features and functionality of the marketing management international  inc mmi products to be incorporated under the current webforce umbrella 
the company estimated the net realizable value of the mmi product to be greater than our carrying value in accordance with statement of financial accounting  standard  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed sfas  however  due to the new version of webforce which was to replace the mmi product  the estimated useful life of the mmi capitalized software was reduced to approximately six months 
as a result  we accelerated the amortization to coincide with the estimated useful life of the product and recorded an additional  of amortization expense 
the remaining decrease in amortization relates to amortization recorded in on purchased capitalized software costs from the company s acquisition of analytika and associated business computing  n 
v abc 
these were fully written off in the second quarter of and therefore there was no amortization expense in the increase in the third party vendor license fees is directly related to the increase in sales of third party licenses during the fourth quarter of during the second quarter of  the company recorded an impairment charge of  related to its purchased capitalized software costs from its acquisitions of analytika and abc 
as discussed above  the company entered into a new product strategy in this new strategy called for the retirement of the abc and analytika products since features and functionality were not being incorporated under the new webforce umbrella 
at that time  we determined that we would no longer offer the analytika and abc products  but would continue to support both products until existing customer contract terms expired 
as a result  no revenues were forecasted for either product in the future other than those under existing contracts 
further  despite the lack of future revenue we needed to maintain the infrastructure required to support our analytika and abc products for the term of each contract 
since the forecasted revenue base was significantly reduced yet the infrastructure and administrative costs remained relatively fixed  these operations transitioned from positive to negative cash flows 
in accordance with sfas we compared the unamortized capitalized software developments costs to the net realizable value of that product 
in our analysis  the net realizable value for the analytika and abc products was determined to be negative due to the fact that estimated future revenues generated from new sales were zero 
as a result all of the purchased capitalized software associated with analytika and abc was determined to be impaired during the quarter ended june  see note to the consolidated financial statements and restructuring charge and asset impairment below for a discussion of the restructuring charges and asset impairments recorded in the year ended december  cost of services decreased  to  in  down from  in this decrease was due primarily to  of unusual costs recorded in the year ended december   which related to the recognition of future losses on selected contracts for which we expected the costs of providing the future services would exceed the revenue to be received from the performance of the services  which was identified while examining the restructuring of our stroudsburg  pa facility  and  which related to other exit costs  primarily retention bonuses 
the retention bonuses were paid to those employees who would lose their jobs at a future date as a result of the restructuring  discussed below under restructuring charge  but who were needed during the transition to complete assigned tasks related to the exit plan 
during  the company reversed approximately  of the unusual costs related to future loss contracts as the company s future obligations with respect to these contracts were favorably resolved in there was an additional decrease in cost of services primarily due to efficiencies gained from the company s restructuring plan which resulted in relocation of certain services to locations with lower operating expenses 
gross margin for license fees was in up from in the gross margin in was impacted significantly by the  asset impairment and  of accelerated amortization of mmi purchased capitalized software costs that were recorded in excluding these items  the gross margin would have been for as a result  gross margin from actually decreased from due primarily to the increase in the sale of third party licenses as a percentage of total license fee revenue 
gross margin for services was in up from in the gross margin in was impacted significantly by the  of unusual costs described above within cost of services that was recorded in excluding these items  the gross margin would have been for the improvement in gross margin during the year ended december  was due to the reversal in the year ended december  of approximately  of non recurring costs previously recorded relating to the recognition of future losses on selected contracts  for which the company s future obligations with respect to these contracts were favorably resolved 
also contributing to the improvement was a favorable mix shift within our services business and the efficiencies gained from the company s restructuring plan and the relocation of certain services to locations with lower operating expenses that took place during total gross margin for was  up from in for the reasons set forth above 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
sg a expenses decreased  to  in  down from  in as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses decreased to for  as compared to in the decrease in sg a expenses for the year ended december  was partially attributed to approximately  of unusual costs incurred during the year ended december  these costs consisted of the following a start up costs associated with the new facilities of approximately  which included payments to outside consultants for consulting services related to the reorganization of our business of approximately  and  of duplicate employee service costs relating to employee overlap during the transition phase  b transfer of operations of approximately  which included costs that were required to be paid to certain customers for costs incurred by those customers as part of the relocation of some of our services  bonuses paid to employees for their assistance with the transition and transfer of operations  and the accrual of real estate commissions for a building held for sale  c duplicate facility costs of approximately  resulting from costs incurred to have both facilities operating simultaneously for a period of time during the transition ie  rent  utilities  real estate taxes  insurance  etc 
and d relocation and moving costs of approximately  excluding these costs  sg a expenses would have been  for the year ended december   which would have resulted in a decrease of  or for the year ended december  the remaining decrease was principally due to i  of costs associated with the company s crm launch in partnership with oracle corporation during the year ended december   ii a decrease in employment costs due to operating efficiencies and lower management bonuses in the year ended december   and iii the implementation of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which would have resulted in a reduction of goodwill amortization expenses of approximately  had the provisions been retroactively applied for the year ended december  these decreases were partially offset by approximately  of costs incurred during the year ended december  related to a reduction in the size of the workforce completed in the third quarter of research and development r d expenses 
r d expenses decreased  to  in  down from  in as a percentage of revenues  r d expenses remained constant at in and restructuring charge 
on june   the company announced a restructuring of its business operations to reflect a lower expected revenue growth model in the near term 
as a result  the company re examined its cost structure and determined that there were duplicate employee costs and excess overhead costs of approximately to million annually 
the restructuring plan consisted of a reduction of delivery and staff positions and the termination of independent contractors across various departments in the united states and europe 
in addition additional positions were eliminated as part of the closing of the company s facility in stroudsburg  pa 
the stroudsburg  pa operations were relocated to other company facilities in new jersey  virginia and a new facility in bethlehem  pa 
the exit costs  consisting of costs to retrofit the stroudsburg facility  lease termination costs and the write off of leasehold improvements  were included in the restructuring charge while the moving and other start up costs were not included in this restructuring charge and were expensed as incurred 
during the second quarter of  the company recorded a charge of  associated with this restructuring 
this charge was reduced by  to  in the fourth quarter of due to the variance between the amounts originally recorded and management s revised estimate of the total costs of the restructuring 
this reduction of  was recorded within the restructuring charge on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
during the fourth quarter of  the company reduced the restructuring accrual by an additional  due to revised estimates of the total costs of the restructuring 
of the restructuring charge   related primarily to severance that had not been paid as of december  and  accordingly  is classified as accrued restructuring charge in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the restructuring charges were based upon formal plans approved by the company s management using the information available at the time 
management of the company believes this provision will be adequate to cover the costs incurred relating to the restructuring 
the company currently anticipates that the accrued restructuring balance of  as of december  will be paid in the activity on the accrued restructuring charge balance for the year ended december  is summarized in the table below accrued restructuring as of january  cash payments in reversal of accrual in accrued restructuring as of december  termination payments to employees    facility exit costs   contract termination and other restructuring costs   asset impairment 
during the year ended december   the company reviewed the carrying value of its long lived assets including the facility held for sale 
based upon this review  the carrying value of the facility held for sale was adjusted 
the new fair value less costs to sell  of approximately  was determined based upon a third party valuation 
the resulting  impairment loss has been recorded as a separate line item in the statement of operations 
during the year ended december   the company reviewed the carrying values of its long lived assets  including its minority investments in start up ventures  identifiable intangibles and goodwill 
during the review of two start up ventures  the company became aware of a series of operating losses and the need of each start up venture to obtain additional financing to continue operations which became especially severe in the second quarter of in addition  prior to the end of both start up ventures filed for bankruptcy 
as a result  during the year ended december   the company wrote off  of cost method investments it had in these two start up ventures due to an other than temporary decline in the fair value of these investments 
as part of its partnership with oracle corporation  the company announced on june   its intention to market an integrated crm solution to meet the specialized needs of the worldwide pharmaceutical industry 
as a result  the company s vision and product platform changed 
as discussed above in cost of revenues we determined that we would no longer offer the analytika and abc products  but would continue to support both products until existing customer contract terms expired 
as a result  no revenues were forecasted for either product for the future other than those under existing contracts 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  we reviewed the future undiscounted net cash flows for our analytika and abc products and determined the cash flows to be negative due to the fact the projected revenue generated from new sales for each operation was zero 
as a result  all the goodwill associated with analytika and abc was impaired during the quarter ended june  accordingly  the company recorded an impairment charge of  of goodwill during the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with its second quarter restructuring  the company made the decision not to occupy a recently acquired facility and instead shifted its operations to other existing facilities 
the company therefore decided to sell a recently acquired facility 
an asset impairment of  was recorded to reduce the carrying value of its facility held for sale to its then current estimated fair market value including selling costs 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income 
interest income decreased to  in the year ended december   down  or from  in the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower short term interest rates versus last year which adversely impacted interest income during the year ended december  provision for income taxes 
the effective tax expense rate recorded for the year ended december  was  as compared with an effective tax benefit rate of for the year ended december  in july  the state of new jersey enacted new tax legislation that adversely impacts the effective state tax rate of most companies operating in new jersey 
this legislation is retroactive to january  the effect of this legislation increased the company s effective tax rate from to for the tax year 
the higher effective tax rate resulted in approximately  of additional income tax expense in the difference in rates also resulted from the net loss position and the write off of certain goodwill amounts which were not deductible for tax purposes  both of which occurred during years ended december  and revenues 
total revenues increased  to  in  up from  in license fee revenues decreased  to  in  down from  in license fee revenues as a percentage of total revenues were in as compared to in license fees are  by nature  non recurring items 
the overall decrease related to fewer licenses signed with new customers 
service revenues increased  to  in  up from  in service revenues as a percentage of total revenues were in as compared to in in addition  during the three months ended december  service revenues increased to  from  for the three months ended september  this increase in service revenues was the result of our largest customer completing a major rollout for its entire user base 
the rollout resulted in significant increases in the services rendered to our customer for initial training  peak period hardware and help desk support 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased  to  in  up from  in cost of license fees increased  to  in  up from  in cost of license fees includes the amortization of capitalized software development costs and third party vendor license fees 
the costs associated with third party vendor licenses increased due to an increase in the number of third party software products embedded in our webforce product suite 
as of june  the company reduced the remaining useful life of the purchased capitalized software related to the mmi acquisition to six months which resulted in additional amortization expense of approximately  during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this acceleration was brought on by the company developing a new product strategy in the features and functionality of the mmi products were incorporated under the current webforce umbrella 
the company estimated the net realizable value of the mmi product to be greater than our carrying value in accordance with sfas however  due to the new version of webforce which was to replace mmi  the estimated useful life of the mmi capitalized software costs changed 
we anticipated the estimated useful life to be approximately six months 
as a result  we accelerated the amortization to coincide with the estimated useful life of the product 
during the second quarter of  the company recorded an impairment charge of  related to its purchased capitalized software costs from its acquisitions of analytika and abc as discussed above  the company entered into a new product strategy in this new strategy called for the retirement of the analytika and abc products since features and functionality were not going to be incorporated under the webforce umbrella

the remaining increase in cost of services was primarily due to overstaffing within our service areas in anticipation of higher levels of growth than were realized during the first six months of gross margin for license fees was in down from in the gross margin was impacted significantly by the  asset impairment and  of accelerated amortization of mmi purchased capitalized software costs that were recorded in excluding these items  the gross margin would have been for this was lower than the gross margin in  primarily due to the increase in third party licenses sold during gross margin for services was in down from in the gross margin was impacted significantly by  of unusual costs within cost of services that was recorded in if not for the effects of these items  the gross margin would have been for this was significantly lower than the gross margin in  primarily due to overstaffing within our service areas in anticipation of higher levels of growth than were realized during the first six months of total gross margin for was  down from in for the reasons set forth above 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
sg a expenses increased  to  in  up from  in as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses increased to for  as compared to in the increase in sg a expenses was caused by several factors  most notably  of costs associated with the company s crm launch in partnership with oracle corporation   of costs including higher facility costs principally due to the opening of a new facility  higher depreciation  and higher salaries and related costs due to the addition of certain key management and changes in our global sales organization and approximately  of unusual costs 
these unusual costs consisted of a start up costs associated with the new facilities of approximately  which included payments to outside consultants for consulting services related to the reorganization of our business of approximately  and  of duplicate employee service costs relating to employee overlap during the transition phase  b transfer of operations of approximately  which included costs that were required to be paid to certain customers for costs incurred by those customers as part of the relocation of our services  bonuses paid to employees for their assistance with the transition and transfer of operations  and the accrual of real estate commissions for a building held for sale  c duplicate facility costs of approximately  which resulted from costs incurred to have both facilities operating simultaneously for a period of time during the transition ie  rent  utilities  real estate taxes  insurance  etc 
and d relocation and moving costs of approximately  research and development r d expenses 
r d expenses increased  to  in  up from  in as a percentage of revenues  r d expenses remained constant at in and restructuring charge 
on june   the company announced a restructuring of its business operations to reflect a lower expected revenue growth model in the near term 
as a result  the company re examined its cost structure and determined that there were duplicate employee costs and excess overhead costs of approximately to million annually 
the restructuring plan consisted of a reduction of delivery and staff positions and the termination of independent contractors across various departments in the united states and europe 
in addition additional positions were eliminated as part of the closing of the company s facility in stroudsburg  pa 
the stroudsburg  pa operations were relocated to other company facilities in new jersey  virginia and a new facility in bethlehem  pa 
the exit costs  consisting of costs to retrofit the stroudsburg facility  lease termination costs and the write off of leasehold improvements were included in the restructuring charge while the moving and other start up costs were not included in this restructuring charge and were expensed as incurred 
during the second quarter of  the company recorded a charge of  associated with this restructuring 
this charge was reduced by  to  in the fourth quarter of due to the variance between the amounts originally recorded and management s revised estimate of the total costs of the restructuring 
this reduction of  was recorded within the restructuring charge on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
of the restructuring charge   related primarily to severance that had not been paid as of december   and  accordingly  was classified as accrued restructuring charge in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the restructuring charges were based upon formal plans approved by the company s management using the information available at the time 
management of the company believes this provision will be adequate to cover the costs incurred relating to the restructuring 
the activity on the accrued restructuring charge balance as of december  is summarized in the table below restructuring charge cash payments in accrued restructuring as of december  termination payments to employees    facility exit costs    contract termination and other restructuring costs    asset impairment 
during the year ended december   the company reviewed the carrying values of its long lived assets  including its minority investments in start up ventures  identifiable intangibles and goodwill 
during the review of two start up ventures  the company became aware of a series of operating losses and the need of each start up venture to obtain additional financing to continue operations  which became especially severe in the second quarter of in addition  prior to the end of both start up ventures filed for bankruptcy 
as a result  during the year ended december   the company wrote off  of cost method investments it had in these two start up ventures due to an other than temporary decline in the fair value of these investments 
as part of its partnership with oracle corporation  the company announced on june   its intention to market an integrated crm solution to meet the specialized needs of the worldwide pharmaceutical industry 
as a result the company s vision and product platform changed 
as discussed above in cost of revenues we determined that we would no longer offer the analytika and abc products  but would continue to support both products until existing customer contract terms expired 
as a result  no revenues were forecasted for either product for the future other than those under existing contracts 
in accordance with sfas  we reviewed the future undiscounted net cash flows for our abc and analytika products and determined the cash flows to be negative due to the fact the projected revenue generated from new sales for each operation was zero 
as a result  all the goodwill associated with abc and analytika was deemed to be impaired during the quarter ended june  accordingly  the company recorded an impairment charge of  of goodwill during the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with its second quarter restructuring  the company made the decision to shift its operations to other existing facilities and therefore decided to sell a recently acquired facility 
an expected sale  scheduled to close in the fourth quarter did not occur and the company wrote down the building to its fair market value 
an asset impairment of  was recorded to reduce the carrying value of its facility held for sale to its then current estimated fair market value including selling costs 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax benefit rate recorded for the year ended december  was  as compared with an effective tax expense rate of for the year ended december  the difference in rates resulted primarily from the write off of certain goodwill amounts in which were not deductible for tax purposes

net cash provided by operating activities was  for  compared to  for this decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was due largely to cash generated in from the collection of an unusually high accounts receivable balance as of december  in other areas  accounts payable and accrued expenses  including accrued restructuring charges  decreased by  during the year ended december  due to continued payments of unusual costs and restructuring accruals as well as lower year end accruals for management bonuses 
deferred revenue decreased significantly in due to the fact that three customers elected to pay us in advance for contracted services to be performed in  prior to the end of these factors were offset by the company s net income in the year ended december  compared with its net loss in the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities was  for as compared to  in the significant decrease was due primarily to the purchase of a facility during which is currently held for sale and higher purchases of property and equipment in related to the completion of our facility moves

excluding the contracted long term receivable  the company s days sales outstanding would have been days as of december  we believe that available funds  anticipated cash flows from operations and our line of credit will satisfy our currently projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements  exclusive of cash required for possible acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies  for the foreseeable future 
we regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire products or businesses complementary to our operations 
such acquisition opportunities  if they arise  and are successfully completed  may involve the use of cash or equity instruments 
on july   the company announced that its board of directors had authorized the company to repurchase up to  of its outstanding common stock over a two year period the stock repurchase plan 
under the stock repurchase plan  the company may repurchase shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time 
repurchases of stock under the stock repurchase plan are at management s discretion  depending upon price and availability 
the repurchased shares are held as treasury stock  which may be used to satisfy the company s current and near term requirements under its equity incentive and other benefit plans and for other corporate purposes 
as of december   the company has repurchased under the stock repurchase plan  shares of company common stock at a purchase price of  contractual obligations and commitments we maintain a million revolving line of credit agreement with the chase manhattan bank  na the agreement is available to finance working capital needs and possible future acquisitions 
the terms of this agreement require us to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth  among other covenants  measured quarterly  which is equal to  plus of our net income earned after january  and of the net proceeds to us of any stock offerings after september  as defined in the agreement 
this covenant effectively limits the amount of cash dividends we may pay 
the credit facility expires on november  at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the agreement and we were in compliance with all of our covenant obligations 
as of december   we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
our principal commitments at december  consisted primarily of obligations under operating and capital leases 
future minimum rental payments on these leases  including amounts accrued for in purchase accounting restructuring accruals  are as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter capital lease obligations     operating leases     total      as of december   letters of credit for approximately  were outstanding 
the company has an agreement with a venture capital fund with a commitment to contribute  to the fund  callable in  increments

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas amends sfas accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require more prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the additional disclosure requirements of sfas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the company has elected to continue to follow the intrinsic value method of accounting as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  to account for employee stock options 
in june  the fasb issued sfas accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  sfas nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
under sfas a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity shall be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred rather than the date an entity commits to an exit plan 
we expect the adoption of sfas will have an impact on the timing of the recording of any future restructuring charges 
in october  the fasb issued sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which superceded sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted this statement on january   which did not have an impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
effective july  the company adopted sfas  business combinations  and effective january  the company adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
it also specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separate from goodwill 
sfas requires that goodwill and certain intangibles no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
for the years ended december  and  amortization of goodwill  net of income taxes was  and  respectively 
sfas also requires that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas  which was superceded by sfas the company intends to conduct its annual impairment testing of goodwill on october of each year 
based on the company s analysis  there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal in november  the fasb issued interpretation  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin changes current practice in the accounting for  and disclosure of  guarantees 
the interpretation requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value  which is different from current practice  which is generally to record a liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable  as those terms are defined in fasb statement  accounting for contingencies sfas 
the interpretation also requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures  even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote  which is another change from current practice 
the company has not issued any guarantee that meets the initial recognition and measurement requirements of fin the company has adopted the disclosure requirements of fin for the year ended december   as required 
in november of  the fasb issued emerging issues task force issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf addresses the accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services or rights to use assets 
this consensus is applicable to arrangements entered into on or after june  and permits companies to account for existing arrangements as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles in accordance with apb opinion  accounting changes 
the company is currently assessing the impact of eitf  but does not believe that it will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements or liquidity 
in november  the fasb issued eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
eitf requires that in cases where the contractor acts as a principal  reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred be characterized as revenue and the associated costs be included as cost of services in the income statement 
the company applied eitf and  as required  has also reclassified comparative financial information for the years ended december  and the impact of applying this pronouncement was to increase both revenues and cost of services by   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the implementation of eitf had no impact upon earnings 
factors that may affect future operating results our business is heavily dependent on the pharmaceutical industry most of our customer relationship management crm and sales force effectiveness sfe products and services are currently used in connection with the marketing and sale of prescription only drugs 
this market is undergoing a number of significant changes 
these include the significant consolidation of the pharmaceutical industry as well as the timing and sequencing of sales to our customers may reduce the number of our existing and potential customers  regulatory changes that permit the over the counter sale of formerly prescription only drugs  increasing food and drug administration activism  and competitive pressure on the pharmaceutical industry resulting from the continuing shift to delivery of healthcare through managed care organizations 
we cannot assure you that we can respond effectively to any or all of these and other changes in the marketplace 
our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we depend on a few major customers for a significant portion of our revenues historically  a limited number of our customers have contributed a significant percentage of the company s revenues 
the company anticipates that its operating results in any given period will continue to depend significantly upon revenues from a small number of customers 
the loss of any of these customers which could include loss through mergers and acquisitions could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business 
we cannot make any assurances that we will retain our existing customers or attract new customers that would replace the revenue that could be lost if one or more of these customers failed to renew its agreement s with the company 
business and economic pressures on our major customers may cause a decrease in demand for our new products and services business and economic pressures on our major customers may result in budget constraints that directly impact their ability to purchase the company s new products and services offerings 
we cannot assure you that any decrease in demand caused by these pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
our lengthy sales and implementation cycles make it difficult to predict our quarterly revenues the selection of a crm solution generally entails an extended decision making process by our customers because of the strategic implications and substantial costs associated with a customer s license or implementation of the solution 
given the importance of the decision  senior levels of management of our customers are often involved in the process and  in some instances  its board of directors may also be involved 
as a result  the decision making process typically takes nine to eighteen months  and in certain cases longer 
accordingly  we cannot fully control or predict the timing of our execution of contracts with customers 
in addition  an implementation process of three to six or more months before the software is rolled out to a customer s sales force is customary 
however  if a customer were to delay or extend its implementation process  our quarterly revenues may decline below expected levels and could adversely affect our results of operations 
our fixed costs may lead to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results if revenues fall below expectations we establish our expenditure levels for product development  sales and marketing and some of our other operating expenses based in large part on our expected future revenues and anticipated competitive conditions 
in particular  we frequently add staff in advance of new business to permit adequate time for training 
if the new business is subsequently delayed  canceled or not awarded  we will have incurred expenses without the associated revenues 
in addition  we may increase sales and marketing expenses if competitive pressures become greater than originally anticipated 
since only a small portion of our expenses varies directly with our actual revenues  our operating results and profitability are likely to be adversely and disproportionately affected if our revenues fall below our targeted goals or expectations 
we may be unable to successfully introduce new products or respond to technological change the market for crm and sfe products changes rapidly because of frequent improvements in computer hardware and software technology 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to use available technologies and data sources to develop new products and services and to enhance our current products and services  introduce new solutions that keep pace with developments in our target markets  and address the changing and increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully develop and market new products or product enhancements that respond to technological advances in the marketplace  or that we will do so in a timely fashion 
we also cannot assure you that our products will adequately and competitively address the needs of the changing marketplace 
competition for software products has been characterized by shortening product cycles 
we may be materially and adversely affected by this trend if the product cycles for our products prove to be shorter than we anticipate 
if that happens  our business  operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected 
to remain competitive  we also may have to spend more of our revenues on product research and development than we have in the past 
as a result  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
further  our software products are technologically complex and may contain previously undetected errors or failures 
we cannot assure you that  despite our testing  our new products will be free from errors 
software errors could cause delays in the commercial release of products until the errors have been corrected 
software errors may cause damage to our reputation and cause us to commit significant resources to their correction 
errors that result in losses or delays could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
increased competition may result in price reductions and decreased demand for our products and services there are a number of other companies that sell crm and sfe products and related services that specifically target the pharmaceutical industry  including competitors that are actively selling crm and sfe software products in more than one country and competitors that also offer crm and sfe support services 
some of our competitors and potential competitors are part of large corporate groups and have significantly greater financial  sales  marketing  technology and other resources than we have 
while we believe that the crm and sfe software products and or services offered by most of our competitors do not address the variety of pharmaceutical customer needs that our solutions address  increased competition may require us to reduce the prices for our products and services 
increased competition may also result in decreased demand for our products and services 
we believe our ability to compete depends on many factors  some of which are beyond our control  including the number and success of new market entrants supplying competing crm products or support services  expansion of product lines by  or consolidation among  our existing competitors  and development and or operation of in house crm software products or services by our customers and potential customers 
any one of these factors can lead to price reductions and or decreased demand and we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete successfully or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we may not be able to compete effectively in the internet related products and services market nor can we provide assurances that the demand for internet related products and services will increase the success of parts of our business will depend  in part  on our ability to continue developing internet related products and responding to technological advances and changing commercial uses of the internet 
we cannot assure you that our internet related products and services will adequately respond to such technological advances and changing uses 
nor can we assure you that the demand for internet related products and services will increase 
our international operations have risks that our domestic operations do not the sale of our products and services in foreign countries accounts for  and is expected in the future to account for  a material part of our revenues 
these sales are subject to risks inherent in international business activities  including any adverse change in the political or economic environments in these countries or regions  any adverse change in tax  tariff and trade or other regulations  the absence or significant lack of legal protection for intellectual property rights  exposure to exchange rate risk for service revenues which are denominated in currencies other than us dollars  and difficulties in managing an organization spread over various jurisdictions 
we may face risks associated with acquisitions our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with acquisitions 
as part of our business strategy  we have acquired businesses that offer complementary products  services or technologies 
these acquisitions are accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in an acquisition of a business  including the effect of the acquisition on our financial and strategic position  the failure of an acquired business to further our strategies  the difficulty of integrating the acquired business  the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns  the impairment of relationships with customers of the acquired business  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  and the maintenance of uniform  company wide standards  procedures and policies 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
we expect that the consideration paid for future acquisitions  if any  could be in the form of cash  stock  rights to purchase stock  or a combination of these 
to the extent that we issue shares of stock or other rights to purchase stock in connection with any future acquisition  existing shareholders will experience dilution and potentially decreased earnings per share 
an inability to manage growth could adversely affect our business to manage our growth effectively we must continue to strengthen our operational  financial and management information systems and expand  train and manage our work force 
however  we may not be able to do so effectively or on a timely basis 
failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results or financial condition 
we may face risks associated with events which may affect the world economy the terrorist attacks of september  and subsequent world events weakened the world economy 
while we did not experience any material impact to our business during the time period immediately following september   we cannot assure you that the resulting impact which the terrorist attacks  threat of future terrorist activity  the current military action in the middle east or threat of other hostilities in the middle east  asia and other geographical areas may have on the us and world economies will not adversely affect our business or the businesses of our customers 
catastrophic events could negatively affect our information technology infrastructure the efficient operation of our business  and ultimately our operating performance  depends on the uninterrupted use of our critical business and information technology systems 
many of these systems require the use of specialized hardware and other equipment that is not readily available 
although we maintain these systems at more than one location  a natural disaster  a fire or other catastrophic event at any of these locations could result in the destruction of these systems 
in such an event  the replacement of these systems and restoration of archived data and normal operation of our business could take several days to several weeks 
during the intervening period when our critical business and information technology systems are fully or partially inoperable  our ability to conduct normal business operations could be significantly and adversely impacted and as a result our business  operating results and financial conditions could be adversely affected 
our success depends on retaining our key senior management team and on attracting and retaining qualified personnel our future success depends  to a significant extent  upon the contributions of our executive officers and key sales  technical and customer service personnel 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
due to competition for such personnel  we have at times experienced difficulties in recruiting qualified personnel and we may experience such difficulties in the future 
any such difficulties could adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
our business depends on proprietary technology that we may not be able to protect completely we rely on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  non disclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary technology 
we cannot assure you that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of this technology 
further  protective actions we have taken or will take in the future may not prevent competitors from developing products with features similar to our products 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
in response to a request by our customer  we have also on occasion entered into agreements which require us to place our source code in escrow to secure our service and maintenance obligations 
further  while we believe that our products and trademarks do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  third parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future that may result in the imposition of damages or injunctive relief against us 
in addition  any such claims may require us to enter into royalty arrangements 
any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
if our third party vendors are unable to successfully respond to technological change or if we do not maintain our relationships with third party vendors  interruptions in the supply of our products may result some of our software is provided by third party vendors 
if our third party vendors are unable to successfully respond to technological change or if our relationships with certain third party vendors are terminated  we may experience difficulty in replacing the functionality provided by the third party software currently offered with our products 
although we believe there are other sources for all of our third party software  any significant interruption in the supply of these products could adversely impact our sales unless and until we can secure another source 
the absence of or any significant delay in the replacement of functionality provided by third party software in our products could materially and adversely affect our sales 
the results derived from current and future strategic relationships may prove to be less favorable than anticipated we are involved in a number of strategic relationships with third parties and are frequently pursuing others 
should these relationships  or any of them  prove to be more costly than anticipated or fail to meet revenue expectations or other anticipated synergies  we cannot guarantee that such events will have no material impact upon our business  operating results or financial condition 
our data solutions are dependent upon strategic relationships which  if not maintained  could undermine the continued viability of these solutions our data and analytics solutions are sourced  in part  from data provided through strategic relationships 
the termination of any of these relationships could diminish the breadth or depth of our data solutions and we cannot guarantee that this would not negatively impact our business  operating results or financial condition 
federal and state laws and regulations could depress the demand for some of our solutions while we believe our data and analytics solutions are not violative of current federal or state laws and regulations pertaining to patient privacy or health information  including the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  we cannot guarantee that future laws or regulations or interpretations of existing laws and statutes will not impact negatively upon our ability to market these solutions or cause a decrease in demand for such solutions from customers that see an increased risk in any such new laws or regulations 
difficulties in subleasing  selling or otherwise disposing of certain of our facilities may negatively impact upon our earnings we are currently marketing our piscataway  new jersey facility 
we also expect to sublease all or a portion of certain other facilities 
if the recent real estate downturn continues  it could negatively impact upon our ability to effectively market these facilities 
an inability to successfully dispose of any of these facilities or to obtain favorable pricing terms could negatively impact our earnings 
unanticipated changes in our accounting policies may be required because of mandates by accounting standards setting organizations and could have a material impact on our financial statements in reporting our financial results we rely upon the accounting policies and standards then in effect at the time of our report 
future regulations  standards or interpretations may require us to adjust or restate financial results previously reported 
a required restatement could have an unfavorable impact upon past financial results or current comparison to previous results 
provisions of our charter documents and new jersey law may discourage an acquisition of dendrite provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  our by laws  as amended  and new jersey law may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
for example  the board of directors may  without the consent of the stockholders  issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock 
in addition  the company has a shareholder rights plan which may limit the ability of a third party to attempt a hostile acquisition of the company 
our common stock may be subject to price fluctuations the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by the following factors the announcement or the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  quarter to quarter variations in our operating results or changes in revenue or earnings estimates or failure to meet or exceed revenue or earnings estimates  market conditions in the technology  healthcare and other growth sectors  and general consolidation in the healthcare information industry which may result in the market perceiving us or other comparable companies as potential acquisition targets 
further  the stock market has experienced on occasion extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market prices of the equity securities of many technology companies have been especially volatile and often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk because we have operations in a number of countries and our service agreements in such countries are denominated in a foreign currency  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
as currency rates change  translation of the income statements of our international entities from local currencies to us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
we do not hedge translation risks because we generally reinvest the cash flows from international operations 
management estimates that a change in foreign exchange rates would impact reported operating profit by less than  this sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one area may be offset by gains from another area 
interest rate risk we earn interest income from our balances of cash and short term investments 
this interest income is subject to market risk related to changes in interest rates  which primarily affects our investment portfolio 
we invest in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy 
the policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of investment 
as of december   our short term investments consisted primarily of commercial paper maturing over the following three months 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
management estimates that if the average yield of the company s investments decreased by basis points  our interest income for the year ended december  would have decreased by less than  this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of and reduced the yield of each investment instrument by basis points 
the impact on our future interest income  of future changes in investment yields will depend largely on the gross amount of our investments
