item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and the other financial information included in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of specified factors  including those set forth in item  business risk factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this report 
overview we provide time critical  technologically complex  multilayer printed circuit boards  which serve as the foundation of sophisticated electronic products 
products within the markets we serve including communications infrastructure equipment  industrial and medical equipment  and computer servers are characterized by high levels of complexity and short life cycles 
our customers include original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and contract manufacturers in the electronics industry  also known as electronic manufacturing services companies 
our time to market focused manufacturing services enable our customers to shorten the time required to develop new products and bring them to market 
we support a strong and diversified customer base 
we measure customers as those companies that place at least two orders in a month period 
as of december   we had approximately customers  compared to approximately customers as of december  sales to our top customers decreased from of our net sales in to of our net sales in the following table shows the percentage of our net sales in each of the principal end markets we served for the periods indicated full year end markets networking communication industrial medical computer peripherals high end computing handheld cellular other total sales to electronic manufacturing services providers are classified by the end markets of their customers 
our products are manufactured to our customers design specifications and are priced to reflect both the complexity of the printed circuit boards and the time and volume requirements for the order 
generally  we quote prices after we receive the design specifications and time and volume requirements from our customers 
purchase orders may be cancelled prior to shipment 
we charge customers a fee  based on percentage completed  if an order is cancelled once it has entered production 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  title and risk of loss has transferred  and collectibility is reasonably assured generally when products are shipped to the customer 
net sales consist of gross sales less an allowance for returns 
we provide our customers a limited right of return for defective printed circuit boards 
we record an allowance for estimated sales returns at the time of sale based on our historical results 
cost of goods sold consists of materials  labor  outside services and overhead expenses incurred in the manufacture and testing of our products 
many factors affect our gross margin  including capacity utilization  product mix  production volume and yield 
we do not participate in any significant long term supply contracts  and we believe there are a number of potential suppliers for the raw materials we use 
we believe that our cost of goods sold will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of net sales 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions paid to our internal sales force and commissions paid to independent sales representatives  as well as costs associated with marketing materials and trade shows 
as quick turn sales become a higher percentage of total sales  our average commission rate is expected to increase 
we expect our selling and marketing expenses to continue to fluctuate as a percentage of net sales 
general and administrative costs primarily include the salaries for executive  finance  accounting  facilities and human resources personnel  as well as insurance expenses and expenses for accounting and legal assistance 
we expect these expenses to continue to fluctuate as a percentage of net sales as we add personnel and incur additional costs related our acquisition of advanced circuits  the growth of our business and the requirements of operating as a public company 
amortization of intangibles consists of intangible assets  which we recorded as a result of the power circuits acquisition in july effective january   we no longer record amortization on goodwill see recently issued accounting standards 
however  we continue to amortize our definite lived intangible assets  which are primarily comprised of strategic customer relationships 
goodwill amortization was million in both and see transition disclosures in note to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring charges relate primarily to the costs of closing our burlington  washington plant 
the charges include primarily the costs of laying off employees and non cash impairment charges related to the burlington building  property and equipment 
our interest expense relates to our senior credit facility and our other long term obligations 
amortization of debt issuance costs consists of the amortization of loan origination fees and related expenses 
interest and other income consists primarily of interest received on our cash balances 
critical accounting policies accounting policies where significant judgments and estimates are made include asset valuation related to bad debts and inventory obsolescence  sales returns and allowances  impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill and intangible assets  customer rebate obligation  and realizability of deferred tax assets 
a detailed description of these estimates and our policies to account for them is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this report 
our estimates are based on historical experience as well as relevant facts and circumstances known to us at each reporting date 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we provide customary credit terms to our customers and generally do not require collateral 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical collections experience and expected collectibility of accounts 
our actual bad debts may differ from our estimates 
in assessing the realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare these with current and committed inventory levels 
our inventory requirements change based on our projected customer demand  which changes due to market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes and longer or shorter than expected usage periods 
we maintain certain finished goods inventories near certain key customer locations in accordance with agreements 
should these customers ultimately not purchase these inventories  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
we derive revenues primarily from the sale of printed circuit boards using customer supplied engineering and design plans and recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  title and risk of loss has transferred  and collectibility is reasonably assured generally when products are shipped to the customer 
we provide our customers a limited right of return for defective printed circuit boards 
we accrue an estimated amount for sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based on historical information 
to the extent actual returns vary from our historical experience  revisions to the allowances may be required 
we have significant long lived tangible and intangible assets consisting of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and definite lived intangibles 
we review these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  we perform an impairment test related to goodwill at least annually 
our goodwill and intangibles are attributable to our quick turn business which has recently generated the majority of our cash flows 
during the fourth quarter of  we performed an impairment assessment of our i goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 which requires the use of a fair value based analysis and ii long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 which requires the use of an analysis of expected future undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the asset 
as of december   we determined that no impairment existed  except with respect to certain assets held for sale in connection with the closure of our burlington  washington facility see results of operations 
if forecasts and assumptions used to support the realizability of our long lived assets change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability and valuation allowances are provided  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
at december   we have a net deferred income tax asset of million 
this amount is net of a valuation allowance of approximately million which was recorded in connection with the acquisition of advanced circuits 
should our expectations of taxable income change in future periods  it may become necessary to record an additional valuation allowance  which would adversely affect our results of operations in the period such a determination is made 
in addition  we record income tax expense or benefit at a rate that is based on expected results for the fiscal year 
if future changes in market conditions cause actual results for the year to be more or less favorable than those expected  adjustments to the effective income tax rate could be required 
in connection with our acquisition of advanced circuits in december  we became contractually responsible for the majority of a rebate obligation to a customer 
the rebate is based on a percentage of net sales to this customer 
we have made estimates regarding the amount and timing of future net sales to this customer and have applied a five percent discount rate to the estimated rebates to estimate the present value of our obligation 
we have also estimated that portion of the total obligation which we believe is a current liability 
based on our future net sales experience with this customer and periodic reviews of our estimation methodology  we may change our estimate of this obligation and the portion that is a current liability 
results of operations the following table sets forth statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangibles restructuring charges amortization of deferred retention bonus management fees total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense interest expense amortization of debt issuance costs interest income and other  net income loss before income taxes and extraordinary item income tax benefit provision income loss before extraordinary item extraordinary item net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales decreased million  or  from million in to million in this decrease resulted from a decline in the volume of printed circuit boards sold and from lower pricing levels 
net sales declined due to a significant downturn that began in in the electronics industry and in the end markets served by our customers 
approximately million of revenue resulted from our acquisition of advanced circuits in late december cost of goods sold cost of goods sold decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease in cost of goods sold resulted from lower labor  materials and variable overhead costs that were associated with a decline in the number of printed circuit board units sold 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold increased from in to in higher medical expense  higher depreciation expense and an increase in unabsorbed manufacturing overhead due to excess capacity resulted in a higher cost of goods sold percentage 
gross profit gross profit decreased million  or  from million in to million in this decrease in gross profit resulted primarily from a lower volume of printed circuit boards sold and to a lesser extent from lower pricing levels 
our gross margin was in compared to in gross margin decreased due to increased medical expense  increased depreciation expense and lower absorption of fixed manufacturing expenses 
operating expenses sales and marketing expenses decreased million from million in to million in the decrease resulted from lower commissions to sales representatives due to lower net sales in as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses increased from in to in the increase as a percentage of net sales was due to lower absorption of fixed sales and marketing expenses and higher average per unit commissions related to a higher proportion of quick turn sales in general and administrative expenses decreased million from million in to million in this decrease resulted from lower labor expense partially offset by higher costs for directors and officers insurance and a higher bad debt provision 
as a percentage of sales  general administrative expenses increased to of sales in from of sales in because the decrease in sales was greater than the decrease in the absolute level of expense 
amortization of intangibles consists of amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets from the power circuits acquisition  which occurred in july amortization of intangibles decreased million from million in to million in this decrease resulted from our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  under the new rules  goodwill is not amortized  rather it is subject to impairment testing 
the amortization expense recorded in was for definite lived intangible assets 
we consolidated manufacturing capabilities by closing our burlington  washington  facility in the fourth fiscal quarter as a result of this consolidation  we recorded restructuring charges of million in of which million is a non cash impairment charge to write down building  property and equipment held for sale to its estimated net realizable value and approximately million relates to severance and other exit costs 
we have laid off approximately employees in connection with the restructuring 
interest expense interest expense decreased million from million in to million in this decrease resulted from a lower interest rate on our term loan as well as a lower balance due to repayment of principal 
the expiration of an interest rate swap agreement on december   also contributed to the decline in interest expense through a reduction in our effective interest rate 
amortization of debt issuance costs amortization of debt issuance costs increased  from  in to  in in december  we prepaid approximately million of our borrowings under our senior credit facility in connection with the closing of our acquisition of advanced circuits 
as a result of our prepayment of indebtedness  we wrote off additional debt issuance costs 
interest income and other  net interest income and other  net  increased million from income of million in to income of million in this increase resulted from higher cash balances  partially offset by lower interest rates earned 
income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased from a provision of million in to a benefit of million in this income tax benefit resulted from a pretax net loss 
our effective income tax rate in was  and it was in our effective income tax rate is primarily impacted by certain non deductible items 
extraordinary item in  we recorded an extraordinary gain of million as part of our acquisition of advanced circuits 
the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the cost to purchase advanced circuits  resulting in negative goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the amount of negative goodwill was allocated proportionately to reduce the assigned values of acquired assets except current assets and deferred income taxes 
the remaining unallocated negative goodwill was recorded as an extraordinary gain 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for the description of the extraordinary gain 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales decreased million  or  from million in to million in this decrease resulted primarily from a decline in the volume of printed circuit boards sold 
net sales declined due to a significant downturn in the electronics industry and the end markets we serve 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold decreased million  or  from million in to million in lower cost of goods sold resulted from a decline in the number of printed circuit boards sold  combined with a work force reduction and decreased employee overtime  partially offset by higher depreciation expense 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold increased from in to in the reduced revenue base caused an increase in unabsorbed manufacturing overhead  resulting in higher cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales 
gross profit gross profit decreased million  or  from million in to million in this decrease in gross profit resulted from a lower volume of printed circuit boards sold 
our gross margin was during  compared to for gross margin decreased due to lower absorption of fixed manufacturing expenses 
operating expenses sales and marketing expenses decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease resulted from lower commissions due to lower net sales in general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million in to million in this decrease resulted from a lower bad debt provision  reduced incentive compensation  a decline in office rent expense and lower legal and accounting fees 
the lower bad debt provision was due to a smaller accounts receivable balance and an improved aging of accounts receivable in amortization of intangibles consists of amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets from the power circuits acquisition  which occurred in july amortization of intangibles was million for both and with the proceeds of our initial public offering in september  we bought out our deferred retention bonus plan 
therefore  we recorded no amortization of the deferred retention bonus in as compared to million for in conjunction with our initial public offering in september  we amended and consolidated our management agreements with tc management  tc management iv and brockway moran partners management 
under the amended agreement  we are not required to pay management and consulting fees  although we are required to pay financial advisory fees in the event of certain transactions as defined in the amended agreement 
we had no management fees and related expenses in  compared to million in interest expense interest expense decreased million from million in to million in this decrease resulted primarily from our repayment of indebtedness with the proceeds of our initial public offering and cash flow from operations 
this repayment significantly reduced our debt and decreased our accompanying level of interest expense 
amortization of debt issuance costs amortization of debt issuance costs decreased  from  in to  in as a result of our repayment of indebtedness and the refinancing of our senior credit facility in september  we wrote off a significant portion of our debt issuance costs 
interest income and other  net interest income and other  net  which includes rental income  increased  from  in to  in this change was due primarily to increased interest income earned on our higher average cash balance during  partially offset by a decrease in net rental income 
net rental income decreased from  for to a net expense of  for due to the termination of a sublease to allow for the expansion of our santa ana  california  facility 
income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased from a net benefit of million in to an expense of million in the net benefit of million in was due to higher pretax income offset by a one time million benefit recorded from eliminating our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
our effective tax rate for was 
extraordinary items in  we recorded a loss of million  net of a tax benefit of million  to extinguish subordinated debt obligations carried at a discount and to write off debt issuance costs related to repayments and refinancing of our senior credit facility 
we recorded no extraordinary items in liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations  proceeds from our public offerings and borrowings under debt agreements 
our principal uses of cash have been to finance mergers and acquisitions  meet debt service requirements and finance capital expenditures 
we anticipate that these uses will continue to be our principal uses of cash in the future 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million in the difference between our net income in of million and our million operating cash flow was primarily attributable to million of depreciation and amortization expense  a million extraordinary gain recorded in connection with the acquisition of advanced circuits  a decrease of million of deferred income taxes  a million non cash restructuring charge for the impairment of building and equipment and a net increase in operating assets and liabilities  net of the effects of our acquisition of advanced circuits  of million 
the change in operating assets and liabilities  net of the effects of our acquisition of advanced circuits  was due to a decrease of million in accounts receivable and a decrease of million in inventories which were offset by an decrease of million in accounts payable  an increase of million in prepaid expenses and other  an increase of million in income taxes receivable  and a decrease of million of accrued salaries  wages and benefits and other accrued expenses 
the acquisition of advanced circuits in late december did not significantly impact the net cash provided by operating activities for the year 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in the capital expenditures of million included million to purchase a building adjacent to our redmond  washington facility 
we acquired advanced circuits for million of which million was a financial advisory fee and certain out of pocket expenses to tc management  tc management iv and brockway moran partners management 
these entities are owned by certain of our shareholders 
approximately million of our capital expenditures were attributable to our quick turn expansion in santa ana  california and technology advancements in our redmond facility 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to million in in  we raised million from selling our common stock of which million came from a secondary offering in february  we repaid million of our term loan  and we repurchased million of our common stock 
in  we repaid million of our term loan and received million from employees who exercised common stock options 
under our existing senior credit facility  we previously borrowed million under a term loan and had a million revolving loan commitment 
the term loan bears interest ranging from libor plus to or the alternate base rate as defined in the agreement plus to and is due in quarterly payments of various amounts through september  the revolving loan commitment bears interest at libor plus to or the alternate base rate plus to and expires september  as of december   the term loan and the revolving loan had an interest rate of 
we pay quarterly a commitment fee ranging from to on the unused revolving commitment amount 
the credit facility contains financial covenants customary for this type of financing  and as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants 
as of december   the amount outstanding on our term loan was million  and we had no amounts outstanding under the revolving loan commitment 
in connection with the closing of the acquisition of advanced circuits  we obtained our lenders consent as required by the credit facility 
under the terms of the consent  we agreed to temporarily limit our borrowings under the revolving loan commitment to million until the credit facility can be amended to subject the revolving commitment to a borrowing base 
at december   our available borrowing capacity under the credit facility was million 
we are presently negotiating the amendment to our credit facility with our lenders and expect to conclude the amendment in april the following table provides information on future payments under our credit facility and future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases as of december  in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt    operating leases total contractual cash obligations    based on our current level of operations  we believe that cash generated from operations  available cash and amounts available under our credit facility will be adequate to meet the debt service requirements  capital expenditures and working capital needs of our current operations for the next months 
we may require additional financing if we decide to consummate additional acquisitions 
see item  business risk factors that may affect future results 
in october  our board of directors authorized a repurchase of our common stock up to the amount of million 
the repurchase of common stock is subject to market conditions and will be accomplished through periodic purchases at prevailing prices on the open market 
through december   we have repurchased  shares for a total cost of approximately million 
foreign currency exchange risk all of our sales are denominated in us dollars  and as a result we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
impact of inflation we believe that our results of operations are not dependent upon moderate changes in the inflation rate as we expect that we will be able to pass along component price increases to our customers 
seasonality we have historically experienced lower sales in our second and third fiscal quarters due to patterns in the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our customers and the end markets they serve 
in particular  this effect is caused by the seasonality of our high end computing segment and customer quick turn ordering patterns 
we expect to mitigate the impact of seasonality through diversification of our customer base 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 business combinations  and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for the fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
other definite lived intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we applied the new rules beginning in the first fiscal quarter as a result  quarterly goodwill amortization of ceased effective january  also upon adoption  we performed the required impairment tests of goodwill and determined no impairment existed 
in august  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application encouraged 
we do not believe the adoption of statement will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statement no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
the statement rescinds sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishments of debt  and an amendment of that statement  sfas no 
 extinguishments of debt made to satisfy sinking fund requirements 
sfas no 
recognizes that the use of debt extinguishments can be a part of the risk management strategy of a company and hence  the classification of all early extinguishments of debt as an extraordinary item may no longer be appropriate 
in addition  the statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for leases  to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
provisions of this statement  as they relate to statement no 
 are to be effective for transactions occurring after may  provisions  which relate to statement no 
 are effective for fiscal years beginning after may  the company will consider the reclassification of loss on the early extinguishment of debt for the and periods upon adopting the provisions which relate to statement no 
beginning in there was no impact of adopting the other provisions of this statement 
in july  the fasb issued statement no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
under statement no 
 a company will record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when that liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 
a liability is incurred when an event obligates the entity to transfer or use assets ie  when an event leaves the company little or no discretion to avoid transferring or using the assets in the future 
under previous accounting rules  if a company s management approved an exit plan  the company generally could record the costs of that plan as a liability on the approval date  even if the company did not incur the costs until a later date 
under statement no 
 some of those costs might qualify for immediate recognition  others might be spread over one or more quarters  and still others might not be recorded until incurred in a much later period 
we are currently reviewing the standard  which is effective for periods beginning after december   and do not expect it to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment to fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  the company has elected to continue using the intrinsic method of accounting for employee stock based compensation 
therefore  sfas no 
will not have any effect on the company s results of operations and financial position 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others which expands previously issued accounting guidance and disclosure requirements for certain guarantees 
fin requires recognition of an initial liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed by issuing a guarantee 
guarantees are required to be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements starting with the period ending after december  for certain guarantees issued after december   the fair value of the obligation must be reported on the balance sheet 
the company does not expect the adoption of fin no 
to have a material impact on its results of operations and financial position 
in january  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 which addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined therein and applies immediately to variable interests in variable interest entities created or obtained after january  the company is currently assessing this pronouncement to determine its impact on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our senior credit facility bears interest at floating rates 
the revolving loan bears interest ranging from to per annum plus the applicable libor or from to per annum plus the alternate base rate  as defined in the agreement governing the amended and restated credit facility 
as of december   the term and revolving term loan had an interest rate of 
therefore  a change in interest rates is not expected to materially affect the interest expense to be incurred on this facility during such period
