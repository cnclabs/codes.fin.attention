overview general 
the company is the nation s largest manufacturer of non wood decking alternative products  which are marketed under the brand name trex 
trex wood polymer lumber is a wood plastic composite which is manufactured in a proprietary process that combines waste wood fibers and reclaimed polyethylene 
trex is used primarily for residential and commercial decking 
trex also has non decking product applications  including applications for parks and recreational areas  floating and fixed docks and other marine applications  and landscape edging 
the company experienced growth in net sales each year from  when it began operations  through the sales increase resulted primarily from a growth in sales volume 
from time to time since  customer demand for trex exceeded the company s manufacturing capacity 
the constraints on the company s capacity during these periods limited the rate of the company s sales growth 
because of these constraints  the company had to allocate its product supply to its network of wholesale distributors and retail dealers 
in response to this allocation practice  the company s distributors and dealers generally stockpiled their inventories of trex to meet anticipated customer demand 
in  and  the company made capital expenditures totaling million  principally to add production lines and increase the size of its facilities to accommodate the new lines 
the resulting production capacity increases enabled the company  beginning in the third quarter of  to eliminate its historical allocation of product supply 
as a result of the termination of the allocation practice in  and adverse economic conditions in  the company s distributors and dealers generally reduced their inventories of trex from levels built up as a result of stockpiling in prior years 
because distributors and dealers were able to meet much of the customer demand for trex from their existing inventories  the company experienced a decrease in new product orders in compared to the prior year 
in response to these developments  the company took a number of actions to reduce its finished goods inventories and conserve working capital 
the company curtailed its production capacity by temporarily suspending operation of a portion of its existing production lines 
at the end of  the company was operating at approximately of its manufacturing capacity 
in addition  the company suspended construction of production lines at various stages of completion and suspended construction of a new plastic processing plant 
in connection with the curtailment of production  the company terminated employees in the second half of  including employees in its manufacturing operations 
in  the company sought to further reduce inventory levels before increasing utilization of its production capacity 
the company s finished goods inventory decreased to million at december  from million at december   as sales exceeded production 
as a result of the sales growth in  the company has placed into operation all of the production lines whose operations it had suspended in at december   the company s capacity utilization was above 
net sales 
net sales consists of sales and freight  net of estimated returns and discounts and certain other vendor consideration 
the level of net sales is principally affected by sales volume and the prices paid for trex 
the company s branding and product diffeorentiation strategy enables the company both to

index to financial statements command premium prices and to maintain price stability for trex 
the prices for trex over the last three years have increased at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 
cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of raw material costs  direct labor costs  manufacturing costs and freight 
raw material costs generally include the costs to purchase and transport waste wood fiber and polyethylene 
direct labor costs include wages and benefits of personnel engaged in the manufacturing process 
manufacturing costs consists of depreciation  utilities  maintenance supplies and repairs  indirect labor and warehouse and equipment rental costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
the principal component of selling  general and administrative expenses is branding and other sales and marketing costs  which have increased significantly as the company has sought to build brand awareness of trex in the decking market 
sales and marketing costs consist primarily of salaries  commissions and benefits paid to sales and marketing personnel  advertising expenses and other promotional costs 
general and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits of personnel engaged in research and development  procurement  accounting and other business functions  office occupancy costs attributable to these functions  and legal expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses have varied from quarter to quarter due  in part  to the seasonality of the company s business 
amortization expense 
in connection with its acquisition of mobil s composite products division in august  the company recorded million in goodwill 
through  the company amortized its goodwill over a year period in an amount of approximately million per year 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 which the company adopted effective january   the company ceased the amortization of goodwill 
critical accounting policies  estimates and risks and uncertainties our significant accounting policies are described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies include the areas where we have made what we consider to be particularly difficult  subjective or complex judgments in making estimates  and where these estimates can significantly affect our financial results under different assumptions and conditions 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as a result  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statement and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results could be different from these estimates 
inventories 
the company s inventories have decreased from million as of december  to million as of december  the company believes that its quantity and mix of finished goods inventory will be saleable in the ordinary course of business and  accordingly  has not established reserves for slow moving products or obsolescence 
the company accounts for its inventories at the lower of cost last in  first out  or lifo or market value 
the company experienced a significant reduction in lifo inventory levels in  as sales of trex outpaced production levels 
this reduction resulted in a liquidation of inventory quantities carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years compared with the cost of purchases in the effect of this liquidation was to reduce cost of sales by million  which represented per diluted share 
at december   the excess of the replacement cost of inventory over the lifo value of inventory was approximately million 
the company cannot estimate at this time the effect of future reductions  if any  in inventory levels on its future operating results 
property  plant and equipment 
as of december   the company s construction in process totaled approximately million 
the construction in process consisted primarily of four production lines in various stages of completion at the company s winchester and fernley manufacturing facilities and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements a plastic processing plant 
the company currently expects that the production lines in process will be put into service in or and that the plastic processing plant in process will be completed and put into service in early pursuant to financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company has compared the carrying values of its long lived assets  including construction in process  against the expected undiscounted cash flows relating to those assets and has determined that no impairment exists as of december  the significant assumptions inherent in the company s estimate include increases in sales volumes and maintenance of gross margins that are consistent with historical levels 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
in such event  the carrying value and the estimated useful lives of the company s long lived assets could be reduced in the future 
contingencies 
the company is subject to various lawsuits and other claims related to securities matters  patent infringement  product liability and other matters 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
the company makes a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies after an analysis of each lawsuit and claim 
the required reserves may change in the future as a result of new developments in any such matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with a particular matter 
in the opinion of management  adequate provision has been made for any potential losses as of december  results of operations the following table shows  for the last three years  selected statement of operations data as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest expense  net income before taxes and extraordinary item provision for income taxes net income compared to net sales 
net sales increased to million in from million in the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to a growth in sales volume as a result of an increase in demand from dealers and distributors and  to a lesser extent  to price increases of approximately 
in  following termination of the company s product allocation practice in the third quarter of  many dealers and distributors met a significant portion of customer demand for trex by reducing their existing inventories  which they had previously stockpiled 
depletion of dealer and distributor inventories in contributed to increased demand for trex and a growth in net sales volume in cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the higher net sales volume

the effective rate increased to approximately in compared to approximately in the lower rate in resulted from revisions to prior year estimated liabilities 
compared to net sales 
net sales decreased to million in from million in  due to a decrease in sales volume 
the decrease in sales volume resulted primarily from a reduction in new product orders from the company s distributors and dealers following the company s termination of its product allocation practice in the third quarter of after the discontinuation of product allocation  many distributors and dealers met a significant portion of customer demand for trex by reducing their existing inventories  which they had stockpiled in prior periods 
the decrease in sales volume in was partially offset by a price increase of approximately 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to higher manufacturing overhead costs  including utilities  warehousing and depreciation costs 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in the increase principally reflected a higher absolute level of manufacturing overhead costs and an associated decrease of approximately from the level in the amount of product manufactured as a result of the curtailment of production capacity described above under overview 
the effects of higher overhead costs and reduced production were partially offset by operating efficiencies from improved production line rates

liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations and growth primarily with cash flow from operations  borrowings under its credit facility and other loans  operating leases and normal trade credit terms 
the company s cash flow provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in higher net sales  gross profit and net income and a decrease in inventories accounted for a significant portion of the increase in operating cash flows in inventories decreased from million at december  to million at december   as demand exceeded the company s production during on june   the company refinanced total indebtedness of million outstanding under a senior bank credit facility and various real estate loans 
the company refinanced this indebtedness with the proceeds from its sale of million principal amount of senior secured notes due june  and borrowings under new real estate loans having a principal amount of million 
in connection with the refinancing  the company replaced its existing million revolving credit facility with a million revolving credit facility with a new lender 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the senior secured notes are secured by liens on substantially all of the company s assets 
the senior secured notes  which were privately placed with institutional investors  accrue interest at an annual rate of 
five principal payments of million annually to retire the notes will be payable beginning in june the new revolving credit facility and real estate loans accrue interest at annual rates equal to libor plus specified margins and mature on the third anniversary of the closing date 
the specified margins are determined based on the company s ratio of total consolidated debt to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as computed under the loans 
the specified margins

index to financial statements for the credit facility range from to and the specified margins for the real estate loans range from to 
the company s ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility is tied to a borrowing base that consists of certain receivables and inventories 
as of december   the borrowing base was million and no borrowings were outstanding under the facility 
the company uses interest rate swap contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in the interest rates under a majority of its real estate loans 
at december   the company had effectively capped its interest rate exposure at an annual rate of approximately on approximately million principal amount of its real estate loans

to remain in compliance with its credit facility and senior secured note covenants  the company must maintain specified financial ratios based on its levels of debt  capital  net worth  fixed charges  and earnings excluding extraordinary gains and extraordinary non cash losses before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
as of december   the company was in compliance with these covenants 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the company s ability to make scheduled principal and interest payments on its real estate loans and senior secured notes  borrow under its revolving credit facility and maintain compliance with the related financial covenants will depend primarily on its ability to generate substantial cash flow from operations 
the generation of operating cash flow is subject to the risks of the company s business  some of which are discussed in this report under business risk factors 
these risks include the following fluctuations in the demand for trex based on general economic conditions  changes in the availability and prices of raw materials needed to produce trex  the performance of the company s most significant distributors  and the company s ability to compete successfully in the increasingly competitive decking market 
the company made capital expenditures in  and totaling million  primarily to expand manufacturing capacity 
the company currently estimates that its capital requirements in will total approximately million 
the company will use its capital expenditures in primarily to make process and productivity improvements to add manufacturing capacity  to complete the plastic processing plant at its winchester  virginia facility and to complete the installation of its enterprise resource planning system 
the company expects that it will continue to make significant capital expenditures in and subsequent years as the company completes its construction in process and then invests in additional production lines and facilities to meet an anticipated increase in the demand for trex 
as of december   the company had a total of approximately million of cash and cash equivalents 
the company believes that cash on hand  cash flow from operations and borrowings expected to be available under the company s existing revolving credit facility will provide sufficient funds to enable the company to fund its planned capital expenditures  make scheduled principal and interest payments  meet its other cash requirements and maintain compliance with the terms of its financing agreements for at least the next months 
thereafter  significant capital expenditures may be required to provide increased capacity to meet the company s expected growth in demand for its products 
of its aggregate capital expenditures of million for the three year period ended december   the company funded million from cash flow from operations and million from proceeds of financing activities  including borrowings under various loan and credit facilities 
the company currently expects that it will fund its future capital expenditures primarily from operations and financing activities 
the actual amount and timing of the company s future capital requirements may differ materially from the company s estimate depending on the demand for trex and new market developments and opportunities 
the company may determine that it is necessary or desirable to obtain financing for such requirements through bank borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
debt financing would increase the company s level of indebtedness  while equity financing may dilute the ownership of the company s stockholders 
there can be no assurance as to whether  or as to the terms on which  the company will be able to obtain such financing
