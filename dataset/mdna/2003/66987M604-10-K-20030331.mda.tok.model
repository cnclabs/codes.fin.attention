item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in item of this form k 
our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows were adversely affected during and by decreases in demand for both wireless products and wireless access services for the transmission of data 
our business was further impacted adversely by the bankruptcy of metricom  which filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code in july sales to metricom accounted for of our revenue during we believe that our available cash reserves  including net proceeds of million received  and the additional million cash to be received as well as the million debt relief to be effective pursuant to the financing transaction in march see liquidity  together with our budgeted operating cash flows and 
table of contents available borrowings under our revolving line of credit will be sufficient to fund operations and satisfy our working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures through the point at which we forecast break even cash flows  which is forecasted to be in the second half of our ability to continue operating without additional equity financing is dependent upon achieving sales and gross margin levels sufficient to cover our expenses which we have not historically achieved 
we commenced volume shipments of our cdma products in  which have generated higher margins and have positively impacted our results of operations  particularly as we started to realize the benefits of our partnership with lg innotek co 
ltd 
simultaneously  our business has been negatively impacted by the decrease in cdpd sales  particularly our cradle sales  which have decreased to insignificant levels as the market for these products has decreased 
as a result  we are becoming dependant on sales and profits from shipments of cdma and gprs products 
although we have made sales of these products in and continue to make sales in  the majority of these sales have been cdma products to one customer 
although we are confident of our ability to generate future profitable sales of cdma and gprs products  there can be no assurance that our sales of these products will be made at volumes sufficient to generate enough cash flow to cover our operating expenses 
a decrease in our cash flows or our failure to generate significant additional revenue from new or existing products  whether due to lack of market acceptance  competition  technological change or otherwise  or the inability to reduce manufacturing and or operating costs  will further adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations  and materially adversely affect our ability to continue our business as presently conducted 
we cannot predict with any certainty whether we will be able to maintain or improve upon our historical sales volumes with our existing customers  or whether we will be able to attract new customers for our wireless technology products 
in the event that we do not achieve our budgeted sales and cash flows  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing 
without such financing  we may have to cease operations 
critical accounting policies use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant estimates include inventory adjustments for excess and obsolete balances  allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  warranty expense  sales returns allowance  the use of option pricing models to establish values of equity instruments issued in non monetary transactions with non employees  useful lives and realizability of long lived assets and estimates for costs recorded in restructuring accruals 
specifically  management must make estimates in the following areas allowance for doubtful accounts we provide a reserve against our receivables for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay 
we determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts  aged receivables  economic conditions  historical losses and our customers credit worthiness 
amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve 
to minimize the likelihood of uncollectibility  customers credit worthiness is reviewed periodically based on independent credit reporting services  our experience with the customer and the economic condition of the customer s industry 
should a customer s account become past due  we generally place a hold on the account and discontinue further shipments to that customer  minimizing further risk of loss 
additionally  our policy is to generally fully reserve for all accounts with aged balances greater than one year 
the likelihood of a material loss on an uncollectible account would be mainly dependent on deterioration in the overall economic conditions in our industry or the industry of our customers 
reserves are fully provided for all expected or probable losses of this nature 
trade accounts receivable along with accounts receivable related parties balances were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was 
million at december  and december   respectively 

table of contents inventory adjustments inventories are stated at lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we review the components of our inventory and our inventory purchase commitments on a regular basis for excess  obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales 
the likelihood of any material inventory write down is dependent on various items  including customer demand  economic and competitive conditions  technological advances or new product introductions by us or our customers that vary from our current expectations 
in  we determined that certain components in inventory had been adversely impacted by the slowing economy 
accordingly  we recorded charges totaling million and million for excess and obsolete raw material components and finished goods during and  respectively 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue  classification of inventory markdowns and other costs associated with a restructuring  all inventory adjustments are classified in cost of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
inventories were stated at million and million at december  and december   respectively 
valuation of intangible and long lived assets we periodically assess the impairment of intangible and long lived assets which requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
the assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset s  or the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
in addition  we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate over the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us 
if a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates  the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase 
software development costs software development costs for products sold primarily firmware embedded in the company s products incurred after technological feasibility is established are capitalized in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
we determine the point at which technological feasibility has been established for a product ie  when we have completed all planning  designing  coding and testing activities that are necessary to establish that a product can be produced to meet design specifications  and the point at which a product is available for general release to customers  by creating detail program designs of the product 
such detail program designs take product function  feature and technical requirements to their most detailed  logical form and are ready for coding 
capitalized software development costs are amortized when products are available for general release to customers  over the estimated useful lives of the products  currently five years 
at december  and december   our net software development costs of million and million  respectively  relating to costs for cdma and gprs  are grouped with intangible assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
accrued restructuring related costs to the extent that exact amounts are not determinable  we have estimated amounts for direct costs of our expenses and liabilities related to our restructurings in accordance with the emerging issues task force issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
these estimates consist of future lease obligations offset by estimated sublease income 
our accrued restructuring related costs were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential costs or expenses could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded an impairment charge in the amount of  for a software license that is no longer deemed recoverable from future operations 

table of contents litigation reserves litigation issues for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
estimates are based upon the facts and circumstances of each case and on advice from legal counsel regarding probable outcomes  if determinable 
the likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves depends on new claims as they may arise and the favorable or unfavorable outcome of the particular litigation 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we account for costs of stock based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
additionally  we disclose the pro forma effect on net loss and related per share amounts as if the fair value method prescribed by sfas no 
had been used to account for its stock based employee compensation see note 
we account for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
and related eitf amendments 
we also follow the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas no 
valuation of deferred income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future years of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end 
if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized  a valuation allowance is recognized 
we have established a valuation allowance against our current deferred tax assets of million and against our long term deferred tax assets of million  at december   due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such assets due to various factors  including the risk that we do not attain profitability  in order to utilize net operating losses 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets depends on future taxable income  our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income  the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate and changes in the deductibility of interest paid on our convertible subordinated debt 
revenue recognition our revenue is generated from the sale of wireless modems to wireless telecommunications operators  wireless data content and service providers  resellers and oem customers 
revenue from product sales and development services is recognized upon the latest of transfer of title  shipment of the product to the customer or rendering services 
revenues from long term supply contracts are recognized as products are shipped to customers 
we record deferred revenue for cash payments received from customers in advance of product shipments 
we grant price protection provisions to certain customers and track pricing and other terms offered to customers buying similar products to assess compliance with these provisions 
to date  we have not incurred material price protection expenses 
we establish reserves for estimated product returns allowances in the period in which revenue is recognized 
in estimating our future product returns  we consider various relevant factors  including our stated return policies and practices and our historical trends 
the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  sab provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
we believe that our revenue recognition policy is consistent with this guidance and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
if our shipping policies  including the point of title transfer such as changing from freight on board shipping point to freight on board destination  were to change  materially different reported results would be likely 

table of contents impact of recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
the purpose of the proposed amendment is to enable companies that choose to adopt the fair value based method to report the full effect of employee stock options in their financial statements immediately upon adoption 
the company will continue to apply the disclosure only provisions of sfas see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s treatment of stock options 
the transition provisions of the statement are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  in november  the fasb published interpretation no  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the interpretation expands on the accounting guidance of statements no 
  and and incorporates without change the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 which is being superseded 
the interpretation elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value  or market value  of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   regardless of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements in the interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we are currently evaluating what effect the adoption of the recognition and measurement provision of this statement will have on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
applies to costs associated with an exit activity including restructuring or with a disposal of long lived assets 
those activities can include eliminating or reducing product lines  terminating employees and contracts  and relocating plant facilities or personnel 
under sfas no 
 a company will record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when that liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 
under current rules  companies can record a liability for restructuring costs when a commitment to a plan of action is made 
sfas no 
will require a company to disclose information about its exit and disposal activities  the related costs  and changes in those costs in the notes to the interim and annual financial statements that include the period in which an exit activity is initiated and in any subsequent period until the activity is completed 
sfas no 
is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   with earlier adoption encouraged 
under sfas no 
 a company may not restate its previously issued financial statements  and the new statement grandfathers the accounting for liabilities that a company had previously recorded under emerging issues task force issue in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections as of april sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  sfas rescinds sfas and sfas  which required that all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt be aggregated  and if material  classified as an extraordinary item 
as a result  gains and losses from extinguishment of debt be aggregated  and if material  classified as an extraordinary item 
as a result  gains and losses from debt extinguishment are to be classified as extraordinary only if they meet the criteria set forth in accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas also requires that sale leaseback accounting be used for capital lease modifications with economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions 
we do not expect implementation to have a significant effect on its results of operation or consolidated financial condition 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which 
table of contents it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs would be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  a company will recognize a gain or loss on settlement 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we have not yet determined the impact  if any  of the adoption of sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
sfas no 
requires the use of a non amortization approach to account for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that acquired intangible assets be separately identified and amortized over their individual useful lives 
we were required to adopt these statements beginning january  as the company does not have goodwill or any intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  the adoption of these standards did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
but retains sfas no 
s fundamental provisions for recognition and measurement of impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas no 
also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
for segments of a business to be disposed of but retains apb opinion no 
s requirement to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
sfas no 
became effective for the company beginning january  adoption of sfas no 
as of january  did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

net loss 
the net loss for increased million  or  to million compared to million in liquidity and capital resources during the fourth quarter of  management determined that we had insufficient working capital to continue operations through the second quarter of as a consequence  on march   we entered into a series of agreements  including the securities purchase agreement the purchase agreement with a group of investors the investors in connection with the private placement of million of convertible debt and equity securities  and the issuance of up to of equity securities in satisfaction of outstanding third party obligations 
as a result of these agreements  we completed  or agreed to complete subject to stockholder approval  for which we have scheduled a special meeting of stockholders for april   the following transactions which are collectively referred to as the private placement transactions on march   we received cash of million in exchange for issuing million of secured subordinated convertible promissory notes the initial convertible notes  convertible subject to stockholder approval into newly authorized series b stock  and common stock  and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock  upon receiving stockholder approval  we agreed to sell  additional shares of series b stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock in exchange for million in cash  and upon receiving stockholder approval  we agreed to issue million of secured subordinated convertible promissory notes the additional convertible notes  to the investors in satisfaction of presently outstanding third party obligations to be acquired by the investors from sanmina sci corporation the sanmina obligations 
the investors agreed subsequently to convert the additional convertible notes into  shares of series b stock 
the purchase of the sanmina obligations by the investors is conditioned upon us receiving stockholder approval for the private placement transactions as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
approval of the private placement transactions is sought in order to satisfy the stockholder approval requirements contained in our listing agreement with the nasdaq stock market nasdaq 
our listing agreement with nasdaq requires stockholder approval for any issuance of common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of common stock when the issuance or potential issuance i may result in a change in control of the issuer or ii will result in the issuance of securities at a per share price below the then current quoted bid price or book value per share and which in the aggregate represent or more of the value  or or more of the voting power  of the then outstanding common shares 
upon completion of the private placement transactions and conversion of the additional convertible notes to equity  which is scheduled to be completed four quarters after stockholder approval  or sooner at the investors election  and assuming we do not issue additional shares of capital stock of a material number in the interim  the investors collectively will hold more than of our capital stock and more than of the voting power 
table of contents of our capital stock and will have paid a price per share less than the quoted bid price per share of the common stock as of the date the agreements were executed 
the convertible notes convert into a number of shares of series b stock equal to the total amount outstanding divided by  the series b shares are convertible into shares of common stock equal to the total amount outstanding divided by 
if stockholder approval is not obtained  we would not be able to complete the private placement transactions  and would not have sufficient working capital to continue operations 
in addition  if stockholder approval is not obtained  the holders of the initial convertible notes would be entitled to require that we repay the indebtedness evidenced by the initial convertible notes within days following the termination of the purchase agreement either in cash or in shares of common stock  subject to nasdaq s rules and regulations 
moreover  given the recent quoted market price per share of our common stock  stockholder approval is all but required for practically any issuance of equity securities that would generate net proceeds sufficient to maintain operations through the remainder of the calendar year 
because of the length of time required to negotiate an alternative transaction with prospective investors and assuming such transaction were an equity issuance or an issuance of securities convertible into or exercisable for our equity securities  we would have to present it to the company s stockholders for approval  and in light of our current financial condition  it is unlikely that we would be able to continue operations long enough to pursue an alternative source of financing 
if we continue to experience negative cash flow  we may be required to raise additional funds through the private or public sale of additional debt or equity securities or through commercial bank borrowings to fund our working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures 
our ability to obtain additional capital will depend on financial market conditions  investor expectations for the wireless technology industry  the national economy and other factors outside our control 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if needed  the failure to secure additional financing would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results and may impair our ability to continue at the current level or cause us to cease our operations 
our auditors report in our consolidated financial statements was modified to highlight an uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern 
since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through sales of our equity securities and the issuance of debt instruments  and to a lesser extent  capital lease arrangements and borrowings under our line of credit 
to date  gross proceeds from these transactions have totaled approximately million  including gross proceeds from our initial public offering in november of million  gross proceeds from the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option in december of million  gross proceeds from the series a redeemable and convertible preferred stock financing in december of approximately million and gross proceeds from the common stock issuance in september of approximately million 
at december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our line of credit of million 
we are party to a credit facility with silicon valley bank  commercial finance division  which allows the company to borrow up to the lesser of million at any one time outstanding or of eligible accounts receivable balances 
this credit facility bears interest at prime plus  provided that the interest rate in effect shall not be less than at december   is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and expires on november  as of december   million of borrowings  the maximum eligible borrowings  were outstanding under this facility 
we currently anticipate the current working capital  including budgeted cash flow and available borrowings under our credit facility  will be insufficient to meet our working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures through approximately the end of the second quarter of as previously discussed  on march   we entered into a transaction to raise gross cash proceeds of million and million of debt forgiveness  subject to shareholder approval 
if the transaction is approved by the shareholders  the debt forgiveness and cash received under this transaction is expected to provide the company sufficient working capital until we achieve break even cash flow 
there can be no assurance that the company will achieve break even cash flow 
if we continue to experience negative cash flow  we may be required to raise additional funds through the private or public sale of additional debt or equity securities or 
table of contents through commercial bank borrowings to fund our working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures 
our ability to obtain additional capital will depend on financial market conditions  investor expectations for the wireless technology industry  the national economy and other factors outside our control 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if needed  the failure to secure additional financing would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results and may impair our ability to continue our operations at their current level 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements contemplate the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
there can be no assurance that the plans discussed above will be successful or that we will become profitable or generate positive cash flows 
if we fail to complete the private placement transaction and fail to significantly increase revenues  collect accounts receivable balances and reduce costs  we will continue to experience losses and negative cash flows from operations  we might not be able to continue as a going concern
