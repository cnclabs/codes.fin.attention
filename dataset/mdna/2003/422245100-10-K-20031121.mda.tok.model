for information on the company s business segments  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting 
table of contents principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the company believes the following accounting policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact its results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition fees under the company s hospital contracts are generally fixed fee and are recorded as services are provided 
fees under the company s health plan contracts are generally determined by multiplying a contractually negotiated rate per health plan member per month pmpm by the number of health plan members covered by the company s services during the month 
in some contracts  the pmpm rate may differ between the health plan product groups eg ppo  hmo  medicare 
these contracts are generally for terms of three to seven years with provisions for subsequent renewal and may provide that some portion up to of the company s fees may be refundable to the customer performance based if a targeted percentage reduction in the customer s health care costs and clinical and other criteria that focus on improving the health of the members  compared to a baseline year  are not achieved 
approximately of the company s revenues recorded during the year ended august  were performance based 
a limited number of contracts also provide opportunities for incentive bonuses in excess of the contractual pmpm rate if the company is able to exceed contractual performance targets 
the company bills its customers each month for the entire amount of the fees contractually due for the prior month s enrollment  which always includes the amount  if any  that may be subject to refund 
the monthly billing does not include any potential incentive bonuses  which  if earned  are not due until after contract settlement 
the company recognizes revenue during the period the services are performed as follows the fixed portion of the monthly fees is recognized as revenue during the period the services are performed  the performance based portion of the monthly fees is recognized based on performance to date in the contract year  additional incentive bonuses are recognized based on performance to date in the contract year to the extent such amounts are considered collectible based on credit risk and or business relationships 
the company assesses its level of performance based on medical claims and other data contractually required to be supplied monthly by the health plan customer 
estimates that may be included in the company s assessment of performance include medical claims incurred but not reported and a health plan s medical cost trend compared to a baseline year 
in addition  the company may also provide reserves  when appropriate  for billing adjustments at contract reconciliation contractual reserves 
in the event interim performance measures indicate that performance targets are not being met  or data from the health plan is insufficient or incomplete to measure performance  fees subject to refund are not recognized as revenues but rather are recorded in a current liability account contract billings in excess of earned revenue 
in the event that performance levels are not met by the end of the contract year  the company is contractually obligated to refund some or all of the performance based fees 
the company would only reverse revenues previously recognized in those situations in which performance to date in the contract year  previously above targeted levels  dropped below targeted levels due to subsequent adverse performance and or adjustments in contractual reserves 
the settlement process under a contract  which includes the settlement of any performance based fees and generally is not completed until six to eight months after the end of a contract year  involves reconciliation of health care claims and clinical data 
data reconciliation differences between the company and the customer can arise due to health plan data deficiencies  omissions and or data 
table of contents discrepancies  for which the company provides contractual allowances until agreement is reached with respect to identified issues 
impairment of intangible assets and goodwill the company elected early adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on september   the beginning of the fiscal year  at which time it ceased amortization of goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill acquired is reviewed for impairment by reporting unit on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable 
in the event the company determines that the carrying value of goodwill is impaired based upon an impairment review  the measurement of any impairment is calculated using a fair value based goodwill impairment test as required under the provisions of sfas no 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between two willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenues performance measures 
the company s other identifiable intangible assets  such as covenants not to compete and acquired technologies  are amortized on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
the company also assesses the impairment of its other identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in the event the company determines that the carrying value of other identifiable intangible assets may not be recoverable  the measurement of any impairment is calculated using an estimate of the asset s fair value based on the projected net cash flows expected to result from that asset  including eventual disposition 
future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and or other intangible assets associated with its acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
health plan contracts a majority of the company s fiscal through revenues were generated from programs that are designed to assist health plans in reducing health care costs and improving the quality of care for health plan members with chronic diseases such as diabetes  cardiac disease and respiratory disease 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its future revenue growth will continue to result from providing disease management and care enhancement services to health plans 
implementation of the company s first disease management contracts with health plans occurred in fiscal for enrollees of these health plans with diabetes 
while continuing to contract with additional health plans to provide diabetes services in the years since fiscal  the company introduced its cardiac disease management program in fiscal and its respiratory disease management program in fiscal during fiscal  the company signed its first contracts with health plans to deliver its cardiac and respiratory disease programs 
during fiscal  the company announced the launch of its total population care enhancement strategy designed to identify and provide care enhancement services for health plan members identified as having or at risk for developing one or more high cost diseases or impact conditions 
during fiscal  the company signed and implemented its first total population care enhancement contracts and became the first organization to be accredited by both the national committee on quality assurance and the american accreditation healthcare commission 

table of contents during fiscal  the company obtained certification by the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations  making it the first care enhancement provider in the nation to be accredited or certified by all three accrediting organizations 
the company believes that its patient and physician support regimens  delivered and or supervised by a multi disciplinary team  assist in ensuring the provision of effective care for the treatment of the disease or condition  which will improve the health status of the enrollee populations with the disease or condition and reduce both the short term and long term health care costs for these enrollees 
the company s health plan disease management and care enhancement services range from telephone and mail contacts directed primarily to health plan members with targeted diseases from one of the company s care enhancement centers to services that include providing local market resources to address acute episode interventions and coordination of care with local health care providers 
fees under the company s health plan contracts are generally determined by multiplying a contractually negotiated rate per health plan member per month by the number of health plan members covered by the company s services during the month 
in some contracts  the pmpm rate may differ between the health plan product groups eg ppo  hmo  medicare 
contracts are generally for terms of three to seven years with provisions for subsequent renewal and may provide that some portion up to of the company s fees may be refundable to the customer performance based if a targeted percentage reduction in the customer s health care costs and clinical and other criteria that focus on improving the health of the members  compared to a baseline year  are not achieved 
approximately of the company s revenues recorded during the year ended august  were performance based 
a limited number of contracts also provide opportunities for incentive bonuses in excess of the contractual pmpm rate if the company is able to exceed contractual performance targets 
the company s health plan contract revenues are dependent upon the contractual relationships it establishes and maintains with health plans to provide disease management and care enhancement services to their members 
the terms of these health plan contracts generally range from three to seven years with some contracts providing for early termination by the health plan under certain conditions 
no assurances can be given that the results from restructurings and possible terminations at or prior to renewal would not have a material negative impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
of the five health plan contracts scheduled to expire in fiscal  two were extended  one was expanded and extended  one was acquired by an existing customer  and one customer  representing less than of revenues for fiscal  notified the company that it intends to terminate services effective december  also during fiscal  one of the company s customers  representing less than of revenues for fiscal  was acquired by another health plan and terminated its contract with the company early 
disease management and care enhancement health plan contracts require sophisticated management information systems to enable the company to manage the care of large populations of patients with targeted chronic diseases or other medical conditions and to report clinical and financial outcomes before and after the company s involvement with a health plan s enrollees 
the company has developed and is continually expanding and improving its clinical management systems  which it believes meet its information management needs for its disease management and care enhancement services 
the company has installed and is utilizing the systems for the enrollees of each of its health plan contract customers 
the anticipated expansion and improvement in its information management systems will continue to require significant investments by the company in information technology software  hardware and its information technology staff 
the annual membership enrollment and disenrollment processes of employers from health plans can result in a seasonal reduction in actual lives under management during the company s second fiscal quarter 
employers typically make decisions on which health insurance carriers they will offer to their employees and also may allow employees to switch between health plans on an annual basis 

table of contents historically  the company has found that a majority of these decisions are made effective december of each year 
an employer s change in health plans or employees change in health plan elections will result in the company s loss of actual lives under management as of january although these decisions may also result in a gain in enrollees as new employers sign on with the company s customers  the process of identifying new members eligible to participate in the company s programs is dependent on the submission of health care claims  which lags enrollment by an indeterminate period 
as a result  historically the company has experienced a loss of actual lives of between and on january that is not restored through new member identification until later in the fiscal year  thereby negatively affecting the company s revenues on existing contracts in its second fiscal quarter 
at august   the company had contracts with health plans consisting of programs to provide disease management and care enhancement services 
the company measures the volume of participation in its programs by the actual number of participating health plan members or lives under management 
although the average service intensity and fee for a health plan member differs by disease or health condition  the company believes that the percent contribution margin is approximately the same for all the company s programs 
actual lives under management represent the number of health plan members to whom the company is currently providing services 
annualized revenue in backlog represents the estimated annual revenue associated with signed contracts at august  for which the company has not yet begun providing services 
the number of actual lives under management and annualized revenue in backlog are shown below at august   and at august  actual lives under management annualized revenue in backlog in s the company is experiencing increasing demand for its health plan customers administrative services only aso business 
these lives are included in the lives reported in the table above 
aso business represents lives for which the company s health plan customers do not assume risk but provide only administrative claim and health network access services  principally to self insured employers 
some of the company s health plan customers that provide aso services have recently begun offering the company s care enhancement services to their self insured employer customers 
during the fiscal year ended august   approximately of the company s revenues were derived from three health plan contracts that each comprised more than of the company s revenue for the year 
two of these contracts also each represented more than of the company s revenues in fiscal years and  comprising approximately and  respectively  of the company s revenues for those years 
the loss of any of these contracts or any other large health plan contract or a reduction in the profitability of any of these contracts would have a material negative impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
during the fiscal year ending august   four health plan customer contracts representing of the company s revenues for fiscal are scheduled to expire under the terms of the contracts 
also  eight additional contracts representing of the company s revenues for fiscal have early cancellation provisions that could result in early contract termination 
no assurance can be given that unscheduled contract terminations or renegotiations would not have a material negative impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents hospital contracts the company s hospital based diabetes treatment centers are located in and operated under contracts with general acute care hospitals 
the primary goal of each center is to create a center of excellence for the treatment of diabetes in the community in which it is located and thereby increase the hospital s market share of diabetes patients and lower the hospital s cost of providing services while enhancing the quality of care to this population 
fee structures under the hospital contracts consist primarily of fixed management fees  but some contracts may also include variable fees based on the company s performance 
fixed management fees are recorded as services are provided 
variable fees based upon performance generally provide for payments to the company based on changes in the client hospital s market share of diabetes inpatients  the costs of providing care to these patients  and or quality of care measurements 
the terms of hospital contracts generally range from two to five years and are subject to periodic renegotiation and renewal that may include reduction in fee structures that would have a negative impact on the company s revenues and profitability 
these contracts are structured in various forms  ranging from arrangements where all costs of the company s program for center professional personnel and community relations are the responsibility of the company to structures where all company program costs are the responsibility of the client hospital 
the company is paid directly by the hospital 
patients receiving services from the diabetes treatment centers are charged by the hospital for typical hospital services 
the company s hospital based diabetes treatment center business had hospital contracts in effect in hospital sites at august  the following table presents the number of total hospital contracts in effect during the past three fiscal years year ended august  contracts in effect at beginning of period contracts signed contracts discontinued contracts in effect at end of period hospital sites where services are delivered during fiscal  hospital contracts were renewed 
several of these renewals included contract rate reductions  which the company has undertaken to maintain long term contractual relationships 
also during fiscal  eight hospital contracts were discontinued 
the company had no material continuing obligations or costs associated with the termination of any client hospital contracts 
the company anticipates that continued hospital industry pressures to reduce costs because of constrained revenues may result in a continuation of contract rate reductions and the potential for additional contract terminations 
during fiscal  hospital contracts representing of the company s revenues for fiscal are subject to expiration if not renewed 
an additional contracts representing of the company s revenues for fiscal have early cancellation provisions that could result in early contract termination 
the hospital industry continues to experience pressures on its profitability as a result of constrained revenues from governmental and private revenue sources as well as from increasing underlying medical care costs 
as a result  average revenue per hospital contract for the years ended august  and declined by and  respectively  compared with the prior years 
the company believes that these pressures will continue 
while the company believes that its products are geared specifically to assist hospitals in controlling the high costs associated with the treatment of diabetes  the pressures on the hospitals to reduce costs in the short term may have a negative effect  in 
table of contents certain circumstances  on the ability of or the length of time required by the company to sign new hospital contracts as well as on the company s ability to retain hospital contracts 
this focus of the hospitals on cost reduction may also result in a continuation of downward pressure on the fee structures of existing contracts 
there can be no assurance that these financial pressures on the hospitals will not continue to have a negative impact on the company s hospital contract operations 
business strategy the company s primary strategy is to develop new and expand existing relationships with health plans to provide disease management and care enhancement services 
the company anticipates that it will utilize its state of the art care enhancement centers and medical information technologies to gain a competitive advantage in delivering its health plan disease management and care enhancement services 
in addition  the company has added services to its product mix for health plans that extend the company s programs beyond a chronic disease focus and provide care enhancement services to individuals identified with one or more additional conditions or who are at risk for developing these diseases or conditions 
the company believes that significant cost savings and improvements in care can result from addressing care enhancement and treatment requirements for these additional selected diseases and conditions  which will enable the company to address a much larger percentage of a health plan s total health care costs 
the company anticipates that significant costs will be incurred during fiscal for the enhancement and expansion of clinical programs  the enhancement of information technology support  and the opening of additional care enhancement centers as needed 
the company expects that these costs will be incurred prior to the initiation of revenues from new contracts 
it also anticipates that some of these new capabilities and technologies may be added through strategic alliances with other entities and that the company may choose to make minority interest investments in or acquire for stock or cash one or more of these entities 
recent developments on september   the company completed the acquisition of statusone health systems  inc statusone  the market leading provider of health management services for high risk populations of health plans and integrated systems nationwide  through the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of the company with and into statusone in accordance with the terms of an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement

in addition  pursuant to an earn out agreement the earn out agreement  the company is obligated to pay the former stockholders of statusone  as additional purchase price  up to million  payable either in cash or common stock  at the company s discretion  if statusone achieves certain revenue targets during the one year period immediately following the acquisition 
at the closing  the company delivered million of the purchase price into an escrow account under the terms and conditions of a separate escrow agreement to secure certain obligations of the former stockholders under the terms of the merger agreement

the average number of actual lives under management increased from approximately  lives for fiscal to  lives for fiscal to  lives for fiscal the increase in average actual lives under management from fiscal to was primarily due to existing health plan customers adding new programs  the signing of new health plan contracts during fiscal and  and an increase in the company s aso ppo actual lives under management from approximately  at the end of fiscal to  at the end of fiscal the increase in average actual lives under management from fiscal to was primarily due to existing health plan customers adding new programs and the signing of new health plan contracts during fiscal and 
table of contents the average revenue per actual life managed under the company s health plan contracts for fiscal decreased from fiscal  primarily because of product mix changes 
new programs  such as the company s asthma and impact conditions care enhancement programs  that were added by existing customers have lower pmpm fees than current programs  such as cardiac and diabetes programs  due to a lower average service intensity per member 
in addition  in fiscal  the company did not record performance based revenues of approximately million on one contract for which  due to contracting and outcomes measurement provisions unique to this contract  the company was unable to measure performance 
the average revenue per actual life managed under the company s health plan contracts for fiscal was higher than in fiscal  primarily because new programs  such as the company s cardiac care enhancement program  added by existing customers had higher pmpm fees than current programs  such as the company s diabetes program  due to the higher average service intensity per member and million in contract performance incentive bonus revenues related to improved performance under the terms of incentive fee provisions of health plan contracts 
the increase in total revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the growth in health plan revenues offset partially by a decrease in hospital contract revenues  principally due to rate reductions on contract renewals and a lower average number of contracts in operation 
the increase in total revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the growth in health plan revenues offset partially by a decrease in hospital contract revenues  principally due to rate reductions on contract renewals

table of contents indirect staff costs associated with the continuing development and implementation of its care enhancement services  and increases in information technology staff 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal and fiscal increased over the prior fiscal years primarily due to an increase in expenses associated with the company s investment in sales and marketing expertise and strategic relationships  and an increase in general corporate expenses attributable to growth in the company s health plan operations

interest expense the company s interest expense was million for fiscal compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to fees associated with an increase in outstanding letters of credit to support the company s contractual requirement to repay fees in the event the company does not perform at established target levels and does not repay the fees due in accordance with the terms of certain contracts  as well as the write off of certain deferred loan costs associated with the company s previous credit facility
