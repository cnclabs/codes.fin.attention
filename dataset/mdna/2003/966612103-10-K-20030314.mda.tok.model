item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of this discussion and analysis is to focus on significant changes in the financial condition of whitney holding corporation and its subsidiaries the company or whitney and on their results of operations during  and virtually all of the company s operations are contained in its banking subsidiary  whitney national bank the bank 
this discussion and analysis is intended to highlight and supplement information presented elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly the consolidated financial statements and related notes in item certain financial information in prior years has been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation 
overview the company earned per share  or million  for this was a increase over the per share  or million  earned for the key components of s earnings performance follow o net interest income  on a taxable equivalent te basis  increased  or million  from whitney was and continues to be moderately asset sensitive  which implies it would experience some compression in its net interest margin in a declining rate environment  holding other factors constant 
the persistently low interest rate environment in did put pressure on the margin  but whitney was able to improve the margin by basis points to  reflecting loan pricing discipline  careful investment of excess liquidity and successful deposit pricing strategies 
o noninterest income before securities transactions decreased  or million 
excluding revenues and gains associated with merchant processing agreements that were sold in  noninterest income grew  or million 
service charges on deposit accounts increased  or million  showing benefits from pricing refinements  new management tools and low interest rates 
income from secondary mortgage market operations was bolstered by a strong refinancing market and ended up  or million 
o noninterest expense  excluding merger related costs in  decreased in adjusting for the impact of the merchant business sale  noninterest income was up a moderate  or million 
a sharp increase in defined benefit pension plan expense was the main driver of an  or million  increase in personnel expense 
close control over capital expenditures and ongoing attention to expense control efforts led to reduction in several other major expense categories 
a required change in accounting for goodwill led to a million decrease in amortization of purchased intangibles 
o the total of loans internally rated as having above normal credit risk at the end of was down million from the prior year s level  helping reduce the allowance for loan losses by million from the end of net charge offs were 
of average loans in  up slightly from  but still favorable in relation to peer and industry statistics 
the company provided million for loan losses in  down from million in the level of the allowance and the provision for loan losses in reflected increased customer credit risks arising from  among other factors  a weakening economy and heightened uncertainty in the aftermath of the september terrorist attacks 
although the company s credit quality statistics have improved in  there are continued concerns relating to the sustained softness in economic conditions and the longer term impact on certain customers business activity 
forward looking statements this discussion contains forward looking statements as that term is defined by the private securities litigation reform act of such statements include  but may not be limited to comments regarding a the potential for earnings volatility from changes in the estimated allowance for loan losses over time  b the expected growth rate of the loan portfolio  c future changes in the mix of deposits  d the results of net interest income simulations run by the company to measure interest rate sensitivity  e the performance of whitney s net interest income and net interest margin assuming certain future conditions  and f changes or trends in expense levels for retirement benefits  equipment and data processing and deposit insurance 
forward looking statements  which whitney makes in good faith  are based on numerous assumptions  certain of which may be referred to specifically in connection with a particular statement 
some of the more important assumptions include o expectations about overall economic strength and the performance of the economies in whitney s market area  o expectations about the movement of interest rates  including actions that may be taken by the federal reserve board in response to changing economic conditions  o reliance on existing or anticipated changes in laws or regulations affecting the activities of the banking industry and other financial service providers  and o expectations regarding the nature and level of competition  changes in customer behavior and preferences  and whitney s ability to execute its plans to respond effectively 
because it is uncertain whether future conditions and events will confirm these assumptions  there is a risk that whitney s future results will differ materially from what is stated in or implied by such forward looking statements 
whitney cautions the reader to consider this risk 
whitney undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement included in this discussion  whether as a result of new information  future events or developments  or for any other reason 
critical accounting policies whitney prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
note to the consolidated financial statements discusses certain accounting principles and methods of applying those principles that are particularly important to this process 
in applying these principles to determine the amounts and other disclosures that are presented in the financial statements and discussed in this section  the company is required to make estimates and assumptions 
whitney believes that the determination of its estimate of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its application of other significant accounting policies 
factors considered in this determination and the process used by management are discussed in note and in the following section on loans and allowance for loan losses 
although management believes it has identified appropriate factors for review and designed and implemented adequate procedures to support the estimation process that are consistently followed  the allowance remains an estimate about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
over time  changes in economic conditions or the actual or perceived financial condition of whitney s credit customers or other factors can materially impact the allowance estimate  potentially subjecting the company to significant earnings volatility 
financial condition loans and allowance for loan losses total loans decreased a little under  or million  from year end  and the prior year total was down  or million  from the end of average loans for were  or million  below the prior year s level 
the major portion of these reductions came from the residential mortgage loan portfolio  prompted by increased refinancing activity and management s continuing decision to sell most current production in the secondary market 
although there was some recent growth in the commercial loan portfolio  demand for business credit in general has been restrained for over a year during a period of reduced economic activity and uncertainty regarding future economic conditions 
over this same period  the rate environment has continued to present real estate developers with favorable permanent financing opportunities 
recent growth reflected new customer development and some increased economic activity for certain industry sectors 
conditions that would support accelerated loan growth  however  are not yet evident 
table  which is based on regulatory reporting codes  shows loan balances at december  and at the end of the previous four years 
table loans outstanding by type december dollars in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural loans      real estate loans commercial and other      real estate loans retail mortgage      loans to individuals      total loans      the portfolio of commercial loans  other than those secured by real property  increased by million  or  compared to year end this followed a million  or  increase in from the end of overall the portfolio remained well diversified  with customers in a wide range of industries  including oil and gas exploration and production  marine transportation  wholesaling  retailing and manufacturing of various durable and nondurable products  and agricultural production 
there have been no major trends or changes in the concentration mix of this portfolio category from year end  although there has been some noticeable growth in loans to customers in the oil and gas industry as discussed below 
also included in the commercial loan category are loans to individuals  generally secured by collateral other than real estate  that are used to fund investments in new or expanded business opportunities 
participations in syndicated commercial loans at december   totaled approximately million  including million related to the oil and gas industry and million to the gaming industry 
substantially all of these loans are with customers operating in whitney s market area and are subject to standard underwriting criteria 
the rate of commercial loan growth in will depend mainly on the economic fundamentals of the company s market area as well as on its ability to develop customers in the newer parts of its market and take advantage of competitive circumstances to attract new business in its established market 
at december   outstanding loans to oil and gas industry customers totaled million  or approximately of total loans  an increase of approximately million from the end of the previous year after a million increase in the increase in included approximately million in new participations in syndicated credits 
the company s customer base in this industry mainly provides transportation and other services and products to support exploration and production activities  but the bank has recently increased its attention to lending opportunities in the exploration and production sector 
whitney seeks customers who are quality operators that can manage through volatile commodity price cycles 
political turmoil and the threat of armed conflict in important producing countries have supported a recent run up in underlying commodity prices for oil 
domestic natural gas prices have also risen dramatically  reflecting larger than expected draws from storage to satisfy winter demand and a continued decline in overall deliverable production 
the commitment to new exploration and development  however  is impacted more by changes in longer term expectations about demand and prices 
the industry appears poised for a period of increased activity  but when this begins will depend  among other factors  on the resolution of current international uncertainties and trends in global demand 
the level of activity in this industry continues to have an important impact on the economies of certain portions of whitney s market area  particularly southern louisiana and houston 
the commercial real estate portfolio  which includes loans secured by properties used in commercial or industrial operations  has been relatively stable since the end of whitney has been able to develop new business in this highly competitive market  including a recent increase in activity at its houston operations 
the overall pace of new real estate project development  however  has slowed with the general economy and heightened economic uncertainty  and growth from new business has for the most part been offset by expected paydowns on and permanent take outs of seasoned projects 
in recent years  activity in this portfolio sector has been driven by apartment and condominium projects  particularly in the eastern gulf coast region  development of retail  small office and commercial facilities throughout whitney s market area  and hotel and other hospitality industry projects  largely in the new orleans metropolitan area 
hotel loans were of total commercial real estate loans  or million  at the end of  compared to at the end of both and the impact of refinancings and the continuing policy of selling most retail mortgage production which began late in was evident in the  or million  decrease in the retail mortgage loan portfolio between and  which followed a  or million  decrease in from the prior year 
whitney continued to promote its fixed term home equity loan product in such loans increased million  or  in  after an increase of million  or  in this product offers customers the opportunity to leverage increased home values and equity to obtain tax advantaged consumer financing 
the rate of growth in this product slowed in and as borrowers increasingly tapped home equity when refinancing their primary home mortgages 
if current market conditions persist  a further reduction in the company s retail mortgage loan portfolio sector is likely in the near term 
loans to individuals include various consumer installment and credit line loan products other than fixed term retail mortgage loan products 
between and  this portfolio sector grew a moderate  or million  mainly from the promotion of secured personal credit lines 
the  or million  decrease in from the prior year reflected  in part  the decision by management to shorten the period it holds student loans before being taken out by the permanent financing source

total in making its risk evaluation and establishing an allowance level that it believes is adequate to absorb probable losses in the portfolio  management considers various sources of information 
some of the more important sources include analyses prepared on specific loans reviewed for impairment  statistics on balances of loans assigned to internal risk rating categories by loan officers and the company s independent credit review function  reports on the composition and repayment performance of consumer and other loan portfolios not subject to individual risk ratings  and factors derived from historical loss experience 
in addition to this more objective and quantitative information  management s evaluation must take into consideration its assessment of general economic conditions and how current conditions affect specific segments of borrowers 
management must also come to a judgment regarding the level of accuracy inherent in the loss allowance estimation process 
a formal allowance analysis is prepared at least quarterly that summarizes the results of the evaluation process and helps ensure a consistent process over time

nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans  foreclosed assets and surplus banking property 
table provides information on nonperforming assets for each year in the five year period ended december  nonperforming loans are included in the criticized loan total discussed below and encompass substantially all loans separately evaluated for impairment 
the million increase in nonperforming assets from year end included million related to surplus banking property 
there have been no significant trends related to industries or markets underlying the changes in nonperforming assets 
at december   the total of loans internally rated as having above normal credit risk was down million from the level at year end the decrease in criticized loans reflected in part improved outlooks for several larger credits 
these included one with a customer in the health care industry that had demonstrated sustained improved financial performance and participations in credit facilities for two customers in whitney s market area that had been downgraded in the later part of and were part of the federal banking regulators shared national credit review process 
criticized loans totaled million at december  loans warranting special attention because of risk characteristics that indicate potential weaknesses totaled million  down million from the end of there was a million decrease  to a total of million  in loans rated as having well defined weaknesses that  if not corrected  would likely result in some loss 
loans for which full repayment is doubtful  however  increased by million  to a total of million at year end the reduction in criticized loans was the main factor behind the million decrease in the allowance for loan losses from the end of  despite a million increase in the allowance required for impaired loans 
no other factor considered in determining the allowance had an individually significant impact 
in both and  the credit risk profile of whitney s customers increased moderately  as was evidenced by higher levels of nonperforming loans and criticized loans in each period 
at year end  management s evaluation of credit risk included an assessment of what impact the economic repercussions of the terrorist attacks on the united states could have on the company s customers 
in whitney s market area  the most immediate impact was felt by businesses related to the convention and tourism industry  including  among others  hotels and restaurants  and by the employees of these businesses 
loan officers continue to monitor the operations of affected customers and their responses to a sustained reduced level of travel and tourism 
management has applied stress tests to identify credits that would have the most difficulty with debt service if the downturn proves to be more severe and prolonged than is currently the case or would have been considered in the normal underwriting process  and the results have indicated acceptable levels of risk 
the lasting impact remains uncertain  however  and this uncertainty along with questions concerning the impact of the economic slowdown that has persisted since has been reflected in the level of unallocated reserves  which remained steady from year end to the most recent year end 
investment in securities strong demand for deposit products during a period of restrained loan demand led to a significant increase in liquidity in information on changes in deposits and other funding sources is presented in the following section 
over time  management directed more of this liquidity to the investment portfolio  particularly to mortgage backed securities with relatively short duration  based on its expectations regarding the stability of the funding sources and the near term prospects for loan demand 
at december   total securities were billion  compared to billion at year end  and the average investment in securities in was up  or million  from mortgage backed securities grew to of the total portfolio at the end of from in the prior year 
short term liquidity investments  including federal funds sold  totaled million at the end of  compared to million at year end on average  liquidity investments were million  compared to million in  but the total declined throughout table distribution of investment maturities december  over one through over five through dollars in thousands one year and less five years ten years over ten years total amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield securities available for sale mortgage backed securities a      u

c these securities have no stated maturities or guaranteed dividends 
the weighted average taxable equivalent portfolio yield was approximately at december   a decrease of basis points from approximately at december   reflecting mainly lower rates for reinvestment opportunities in substantially all of the securities in the investment portfolio bear fixed interest rates 
information about the contractual maturity structure of investment securities at december  is shown in table above 
the carrying value of securities with explicit call options totaled million at year end these call options and the scheduled principal reductions and projected prepayments on mortgage backed securities  other than certain collateral mortgage obligations  are not reflected in table including expected principal reductions on all mortgage backed securities  the weighted average maturity of the overall securities portfolio was approximately months at december   compared with months at year end in recent years  whitney steadily built its investment in securities classified as available for sale  primarily as a means to increase liquidity management flexibility 
effective january   the company reclassified securities with a carrying value of million  and an unrealized net loss of million  as available for sale in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
the unrealized loss at the effective date of the reclassification was reported net of tax in other comprehensive income in securities available for sale constituted of the total investment portfolio at december  the net unrealized gain on this portfolio segment totaled million at year end  including a million gain on mortgage backed securities 
the overall unrealized gain represented of amortized cost 
at year end  there was a net unrealized gain of million  or of amortized cost  including million related to mortgage backed securities 
the net unrealized gain or loss will vary based on overall changes in market rates  shifts in the slope of the yield curve  and movement in spreads to the yield curve for different types of securities 
the company does not normally maintain a trading portfolio 
occasionally  the bank holds immaterial amounts of trading account securities for short periods while buying and selling securities for customers 
such securities  if any  are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
at december   whitney held no investment in securities of a single issuer  other than securities issued or guaranteed by the u 
s 
government or its agencies  that exceeded of its shareholders equity 
the company has made no investments in financial instruments or participated in agreements with values that are linked to or derived from changes in the value of some underlying asset or index 
these financial instruments or agreements are commonly referred to as derivatives and include such instruments as futures  forward contracts  option contracts  interest rate swap agreements and other financial arrangements with similar characteristics 
management continues to evaluate whether to use derivatives as part of its asset liability and liquidity management processes 
deposits and short term borrowings at december   deposits were  or million  below the level at december  approximately million of this decrease related to an influx of temporary funds from local governmental entities at the end of average deposits were up  or million  in  but would have been up approximately half this amount if the impact of deposits associated with bank operations purchased late in is factored out 
short term borrowings  the major part of which represents liabilities under repurchase agreements with customers  decreased  or million  from year end  and were down  or million  on average for compared to the prior year 
table average deposits dollars in thousands noninterest bearing demand deposits    now account deposits    money market deposits    savings deposits    other time deposits    time deposits  and over    total    increased demand for the safety and liquidity of deposit products helped fuel accelerated deposit growth throughot many of the factors that prompted the increased availability of deposit funds continued to influence customer behavior during noninterest bearing demand deposits at year end were up  or million  from the end of for the year  average demand deposits increased  or million  including approximately million from acquired operations 
noninterest bearing demand deposits continue to represent a healthy percentage of total deposits  as can be seen in table above 
interest bearing deposits  however  declined  or million  between year end and the most recent year end 
on average  interest bearing deposits were up only  or million  in compared to  despite the addition of approximately million of deposits associated with acquired operations 
the lack of further growth in interest bearing deposits during was largely a reaction to steadily declining renewal rates for time deposits and  to a lesser degree  reduced yields on other deposit products 
the shift in the mix of interest bearing deposits between and was partly a function of funds flows between deposit products  and to deposits from short term borrowings  in response to the reduced yields 
money market deposits were little changed from the end of  but increased  or million  on average in regular savings deposits grew  or million  during  and were up on average from the prior year  at least temporarily reversing a trend away from this more traditional deposit product 
now account deposits were down  or million  at year end  reflecting the temporary influx of public funds at the end of the average balance of now deposits  grew  or million  between and total time deposits  however  decreased  or million  from the end of  and were down a comparable amount on average in compared to the prior year 
table shows the maturity structure of time deposits over and under  at december  the maturity of million of time deposits in the first quarter of will likely contribute to further shifts in the mix of deposits 
table maturities of time deposits dollars in thousands remaining maturity of time deposits of  or more as of december  three months or less  over three months through twelve months  over twelve months  total time deposits of  or more  remaining maturity of time deposits of less than  as of december  three months or less  over three months through twelve months  over twelve months  total time deposits of less than   total time deposits  as noted earlier  short term borrowings consist primarily of sales of securities under repurchase agreements 
in both and  whitney made little use of available wholesale short term funding sources  such as overnight and term federal funds purchased and brokered repurchase agreements  as it had in to fund strong loan growth 
average short term borrowings from customers under repurchase agreements have been relatively stable over the past several years  with an  or million  decrease in  partly representing the flow of funds back to deposits as the effective yield dropped below for the year 
increased funding from this source in recent years reflected both the growth in commercial relationships and the attractiveness of whitney s treasury management sweep product 
because of the underlying customer relationship  these borrowings can be a relatively stable source of funds 
shareholders equity and capital adequacy at december   shareholders equity totaled million compared to million at the end of and million at the end of the major factors in the million increase in were earnings  net of dividends declared  of million  and a million increase in other comprehensive income representing an unrealized net holding gain on securities available for sale 
in  net retained earnings of million and an million increase in comprehensive income led to a million increase in shareholders equity 
over the last three years  the dividend payout ratio has been relatively stable  decreasing slightly to in from in and in the ratios in table indicate that the company remained strongly capitalized at december  the increase in the capital ratios from was influenced mainly by a slower rate of growth in risk weighted assets relative to capital growth 
the increase in risk weighted assets at december  from the end of resulted mainly from an increase in off balance sheet obligations under loan facilities and letters of credit that are converted to assets for the risk based capital calculations 
on balance assets were lower at year end compared to the end of cash business acquisitions  such as the purchases of redstone financial  inc in and bank of houston in  will reduce regulatory capital ratios 
in these transactions  whitney acquires intangible assets that must be deducted in determining regulatory capital  though they are also excluded from risk weighted assets

liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that funds are available to meet cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  while at the same time meeting the operating  capital and strategic cash flow needs of the company and the bank  all in the most cost effective manner 
whitney develops its liquidity management strategies and measures and monitors liquidity risk as part of its overall asset liability management process  making full use of the quantitative modeling tools available to project cash flows under a variety of possible scenarios 
projections are also made assuming credit stressed conditions  although such conditions are not likely to arise 
on the liability side  liquidity management focuses on growing the base of more stable core deposits at competitive rates  including the use of treasury management products for commercial customers  while at the same time ensuring access to economical wholesale funding sources 
the section above on deposits and short term borrowings discusses changes in these liability funding sources in whitney national bank is a member of the federal home loan bank system 
this membership provides access to a variety of federal home loan bank advance products as an alternative source of funds 
in addition  both the company and the bank have access to external funding sources in the financial markets  and the bank has developed the ability to gather deposits at a nationwide level 
liquidity management on the asset side primarily addresses the composition and maturity structure of the loan and investment securities portfolios and their impact on the company s ability to generate cash flows from scheduled payments  contractual maturities  prepayments  their use as collateral for borrowings under repurchase agreements and possible outright sales or securitizations 
table above presents the contractual maturity structure of the loan portfolio and table presents contractual investment maturities 
as mentioned earlier  whitney has built its investment in securities classified as available for sale in recent years and  effective  reclassified in excess of million of its portfolio of securities held to maturity to this category 
these actions further increased liquidity management flexibility 
cash generated from operations is another important source of funds to meet liquidity needs 
the consolidated statements of cash flows present operating cash flows and summarize all significant sources and uses of funds for each year in the three year period ended december  the bank s liquidity position had grown throughout reflecting strong deposit inflows  moderate loan demand  and an attractive refinancing environment 
conditions supported ample liquidity again in  and whitney made investment allocation decisions and developed deposit pricing strategies consistent with management s assessment of the underlying conditions 
the higher level of liquidity in the past two years will likely return to more normal levels with increased economic activity  a return to confidence in the capital markets and rising market interest rates 
whitney holding corporation had approximately million in cash and demand notes from the bank available to provide liquidity for acquisitions  dividend payments to shareholders  or other corporate uses at the end of  before consideration of any future dividends that may be received from the bank 
because the bank has received approval to pay the company dividends above limits set by statutory and regulatory provisions  the bank will be required to seek continuing approval to declare future dividends to the company until it reestablishes dividend capacity under those provisions 
the bank had approximately billion in unfunded loan commitments  excluding personal credit lines  outstanding at december   an increase of million from s year end 
note details these and other unfunded commitments at december  and because loan commitments may  and many times do  expire without being drawn upon  unfunded balances should not be used as a projection of actual future liquidity requirements 
asset liability management the objective of the company s asset liability management is to implement strategies for the funding and deployment of its financial resources that are expected to maximize soundness and profitability over time at acceptable levels of risk 
interest rate sensitivity is the potential impact of changing rate environments on both net interest income and cash flows 
the company and the bank obtain measures of their interest rate sensitivity by running net interest income simulations  monitoring the economic value of equity and preparing gap analyses 
the simplest method of measuring interest rate sensitivity is gap analysis  which identifies the difference between the dollar volume of assets and liabilities that reprice within specified time periods 
table shows the company s static gap position as of december  table indicates that whitney is somewhat liability sensitive in the very near term and somewhat asset sensitive over a one year time horizon 
gap analysis has several limitations  including the fact that it is a point in time measurement that ignores the dynamic nature of the company s assets and liabilities  and it does not take into consideration actions that management can and will take to maximize net interest income over time 
a more sophisticated tool used by the company to evaluate and manage its interest rate sensitivity is a net interest income simulation model  which tests the bank s reaction to various economic environments 
the model is able to incorporate management s assumptions and expectations regarding such factors as loan and deposit growth  pricing  prepayment speeds and spreads between interest rates 
assumptions can also be entered into the model to evaluate the impact of possible strategic responses to changes in the competitive environment

as part of its regular formal asset liability management process  a base case simulation is run that uses current growth forecasts and assumes a stable rate environment and structure 
when the base case simulation as of the end of was subjected to parallel up and down instantaneous rate shocks of basis points  the model showed an annual impact on whitney s net interest income te relative to the base case that ranged from a positive million  or  at basis points up to a negative million  or  at basis points down 
the comparable simulation run at year end produced results that ranged from a positive impact on net interest income te of million  or  to a negative impact of million  or 
at the end of each year  additional simulations were run applying instantaneous parallel rate shocks up to basis points as well as gradual rate changes of up to basis points 
in the recent rate environment  certain downward rate shocks caused unrealistic model assumptions  and the results from these simulation runs were disregarded 
the results of other simulations showed that the company s sensitivity was within acceptable limits  considering established internal guidelines 
like the gap analysis  the net interest income simulations at the end of indicate that the company is moderately asset sensitive over a one year time horizon 
the actual impact of changing interest rates on net interest income  however  is dependent on many factors 
these include whitney s ability to achieve growth in earning assets and maintain a desired mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the actual timing of repricing of assets and liabilities  the magnitude of interest rate changes  interest rate spreads and the level of success of asset liability management strategies implemented 
the method used for measuring longer term interest rate risk is the economic value of equity analysis 
at year end  the company s sensitivity was acceptable under internal guidelines at all levels of rate shock simulation that produced realistic results 
changes in interest rates affect the fair values of financial instruments 
the earlier section on investment in securities and notes and to the consolidated financial statements contain information regarding fair values 
impact of inflation and changing prices the great majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
management believes the most significant potential impact of inflationary or deflationary economic cycles on whitney s financial results is its ability to react to changes in interest rates 
interest rates do not  however  necessarily move in the same direction  or at the same magnitude  as the prices of goods and services 
as discussed above  the company employs asset liability management strategies in its attempt to minimize the effects of economic cycles on its net interest income 
inflation and changing prices also have an impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
changing prices will also affect the trend in noninterest operating expenses and noninterest income 
results of operations net interest income net interest income te increased  or million  in  on growth in average earning assets 
this followed a  or million  increase in over  when earning assets grew 
as discussed earlier  whitney has been moderately asset sensitive throughout and  which implies that it would experience some compression in its net interest margin in a declining rate environment  holding other factors constant 
the net interest margin is net interest income te as a percent of average earning assets 
margin compression did occur in  when there was a decrease of basis points to  but this decline was well below what would have been expected based solely on the steep reduction in market rates during pressure on the margin continued in  but whitney was able to add basis points to the margin during the year  to  in large part through pricing discipline on loans  careful deployment of excess liquidity between the investment portfolio and short term cash management investments  and the implementation of successful pricing strategies on deposits 
the margin improvement in came as a basis point decline in the yield te on earning assets was more than offset by a basis point decrease in the cost of funding these assets 
between and  however  the basis point decrease in the earning asset yield was not fully matched by a basis point decrease in the cost of funds 
tables and show the factors contributing to these changes and the components of these changes 
maintaining the net interest margin at current levels and generating growth in net interest income during a period of continued low interest rates  economic uncertainty and limited earning asset growth cannot be assured 
in both and  the earning asset mix has been impacted by restrained loan demand and higher demand for deposit products  among other factors 
together these factors provided a surge in liquidity to the earning asset mix in that has continued into short term investments grew to of average earning assets in  from less than in  and remained on average at the higher level in over the same period  average loans  including loans held for sale  declined as a percentage of earning assets to in  from in and a high for recent years of in management gradually directed more of the liquidity from loan reductions and sustained deposit demand to the investment portfolio  which increased to of earning assets in from in at year end  the investment portfolio had grown to of earning assets  while short term investments had decreased to less than 
market rates were relatively stable during  after a steep and steady decline throughout the average prime rate during was approximately basis points lower than in and basis points below fixed rate components of the loan portfolio and discipline in loan pricing in the face of restrained demand and heightened competition helped limit the decrease in the loan portfolio yield te to basis points in and basis points in the average rate earned on the predominantly fixed rate investment portfolio decreased basis points in and was down basis points in compared to the prior year 
low market rates have stimulated home mortgage refinancing activity and accelerated prepayments on mortgage backed securities  as was particularly evident in this has offset some of the benefit to the portfolio return from the fixed rate structure of the investment portfolio 
sustained higher demand for deposit products and the implementation of deposit pricing strategies had a favorable impact on the mix of funding sources in the percentage of average earning assets funded by noninterest bearing sources rose to  from in  with a healthy in the most recent period representing noninterest bearing deposits 
noninterest bearing deposits funded of earning assets in lower cost interest bearing deposits supported of earning assets in  up from in higher cost sources of funds  which include time deposits and short term borrowings  fell to of average earning assets in  from close to in total time deposits decreased on average in response to steadily declining renewal rates  shifting in part to lower cost products 
average short term borrowings were lower than in although money market rates became relatively stable in  the maturity structure of time deposits was such that their cost continued to decline throughout the year 
the average rate on time deposits for was basis points below the rate for  and stood at at year end  approximately basis points below the rate at the end of at current market conditions  time deposit maturities should lead to some further cost reductions in the near term 
an improved mix of funding sources also benefited funds from noninterest bearing sources totaled of average earnings assets in compared to in  with from noninterest bearing deposits in each period 
the impact of increased customer liquidity and demand for deposits was most evident in the reduction in the percentage of higher cost funds to average earning assets from in to in during  whitney had made increased use of wholesale funding sources to leverage loan growth in that period and had responded to what then were rising short term market rates with competitively structured time deposit products 
in response to falling market rates  the average cost of total interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points in  including the impact of a basis point drop in the cost of short term borrowings 
as would be expected  however  the cost of fixed rate time deposits in responded more slowly and was only basis points below on average

provision for loan losses the overall credit risk profile of whitney s customers increased moderately in both and as would be expected  net charge offs rose in the subsequent periods  to million in and million in from million in improvements in overall credit risk in led to a million reduction in the level of the allowance for loan losses from year end and helped lower the provision for the year 
whitney provided million for loan losses in  compared to million in and million in for a more detailed discussion of changes in the allowance for loan losses  nonperforming assets and general credit quality  see the earlier section on loans and allowance for loan losses 
the future level of the allowance and provisions for loan losses will reflect management s ongoing evaluation of credit risk  based on established internal policies and practices

income from service charges on deposit accounts increased  or million  in  after an increase of  or million  in both periods benefited from refinements to pricing policies for certain business accounts that the company implemented during the second quarter of in addition  as short term market interest rates declined sharply in  whitney appropriately lowered the earnings credit allowed as an offset to service charges on these accounts  and these lower rates prevailed throughout the combined impact helped increase business service fees by million in and million in both periods also benefited from the introduction  beginning in s second quarter  of automated tools to help banking officers with certain service fee decisions and to measure their performance against corporate standards 
the integration of customers acquired in mergers also generated additional fee income in both and  as did underlying growth in the customer deposit base 
at the end of s third quarter  whitney entered into an alliance with a firm that specializes in processing credit card sale transactions for merchants 
in forming this alliance  whitney sold its existing merchant processing agreements to the firm and recognized a gain of million  while maintaining an interest in the ongoing net revenues generated through the alliance 
with this move  credit card income decreased a net  or million  in  and  or million in the corresponding reduction in credit card processing expense is discussed in the following section 
excluding revenues associated with merchant processing in all periods  credit card income rose  or million  in  and was up  or million in in addition to income from merchant processing services  this category has included fees from activity on bank issued credit and debit cards 
fee income from debit card activity has made an increasingly important contribution in recent years as the company expanded the distribution of this product and saw increasing acceptance and use of these cards for retail transactions 
debit card fee income was up  or million in  on a increase in transaction volume and a increase in the cardholder base 
this followed income growth of  or million  in when transaction volume rose and the base increased 
fee income from credit card activity grew in  consistent with the growth in transaction volume  and was up in secondary mortgage market operations posted a  or million  increase in fee income in in  this income category had increased million to a level over three times that in late in the third quarter of  the company began to shift away from retaining new residential mortgage loans for the portfolio 
in addition  favorable market rates and an expanded sales force generated strong origination volumes throughout and again in refinancing activity accounted for approximately of the loans originated in both and total production was million in and million in  both up sharply from a total of million in whitney sold approximately of this production in compared to in and only in fees on letters of credit and unused loan commitments were the main factors behind the  or million  growth in other fees and charges in revenues from an agreement to outsource the bank s official checks that was implemented in the second half of also contributed to this improvement 
investment service income increased  or 
million  in  mainly on the strength of annuity sales 
increased demand for fixed income securities drove the  or million  increase in this income category in  offsetting softness in retail brokerage activity that was brought on by weak equity markets 
the conditions underlying these changes were also present throughout much of lower asset values in the capital markets were an important factor behind the  or 
million  decrease in trust service fees in  and the limited growth of only in a modification of fee schedules  however  helped limit the negative impact from capital market weaknesses 
the net gain on sales and other revenue from foreclosed assets includes income from grandfathered assets that vary from year to year as opportunities for sales arise 
management evaluates its banking facilities on an ongoing basis to identify possible under utilization and to determine the need for functional improvements  relocations or possible sales 
the net gains recognized in each period from these and other dispositions of surplus banking property are shown in table the total for includes a gain of approximately million related to a property acquired through merger 
noninterest expense table shows the components of noninterest expense with and without merger related expenses for each year in the three year period ended december   along with the percent changes between years for each component

total personnel expense increased  or million  in  and was up  or million  in employee compensation rose  or million  in  including approximately 
million of nonrecurring costs associated with acquired bank personnel  and employee benefits increased  or million 
base salaries and the cost of various targeted employee incentive pay plans  such as for mortgage originators  increased  or million  including the impact of recurring costs of bank operations purchased in late the successful integration of operations and employees from this acquisition and continued attention to efficient management of human resources helped the company keep its average full time equivalent staff level during essentially unchanged from an increase in stock based compensation  which fluctuates with changes in whitney s stock price and employee participation levels  was the main factor in an overall million increase in long term incentive plan expense 
the company provides retirement benefits under a defined benefit pension plan and a k savings plan 
a weak performance by the investments in the pension trust fund or a decline in market yields on fixed income securities will cause the actuarially determined periodic pension expense to increase in future periods  holding other variables constant 
each of these conditions was present in as well as at the end of as a result  pension expense increased million from to  accounting for approximately three quarters of the overall increase in employee benefits expense 
an additional  though somewhat smaller  increase is expected for whitney also expects an increase in the cost of providing health benefits for  following an increase of  or 
million  in in  employee compensation rose  or million  while employee benefits increased  or million 
base salaries and incentive pay increased  or million  including million related to the bank operations purchased late in adjusting for the impact of purchased operations  the increase would have been approximately 
reductions in staff levels achieved through the integration of the operations of pooled entities acquired in early helped limit the overall increase 
stock based compensation again drove the increase in long term incentive plan expense for  which was up million 
effective for  whitney increased the percentage of employee k plan savings that it matches 
the impact of this change and an increase in the cost of health benefits were the major factors behind the rise in employee benefits expense in that year 
equipment and data processing expense was  or million  lower in  following a decrease of  or million  in continued close control over capital expenditures  for both new projects and the replacement of fully depreciated assets  has been the major factor that provided an offset to costs that have been added for applications to support expanded customer services and enhanced management tools and for purchased operations 
systems integration activities completed in also produced savings 
the company does not anticipate a further decrease in equipment and data processing expense in net occupancy expense was little changed in  after an increase of  or million  in the costs added for facilities of banking operations purchased in late were offset by expense reductions in  mainly with respect to depreciation and utilities 
functional improvement projects at certain facilities  including the main office in new orleans  had led to increased depreciation expense in  and high energy prices early that year had driven up the cost of utilities 
the elimination of under utilized facilities helped reduce depreciation and other occupancy expenses in and limit the growth in occupancy expense in from purchased operations and the other factors mentioned above 
the significant reductions in credit card processing services expense in both and were directly related to the merchant business sale discussed earlier 
excluding merchant processing costs  this expense category will vary mainly with changes in income from transactions on bank issued credit cards 
telecommunication and postage expense has been stable to slightly lower over the last few years  despite postal rate increases in both and over the last two years  whitney renegotiated its contract for mail services  improved internal mail operations  and restructured its data and voice communication contracts 
the company has also noted some trends in customer transaction preferences that have reduced the cost of periodic mailings 
the expense for legal and professional services decreased in after rising in there had been a fairly sharp increase in legal expense in that was partly the result of services used to form the merchant business alliance 
with the rise in nonperforming loans in recent years  as shown above in table  there also came increased demand for legal services to support loan collection efforts 
the impact was evident in both and  but the recovery of some relatively significant collection costs and the resolution of certain corporate matters helped reduce legal expense in comparison to the prior year 
the expense for consulting and other professional services was relatively stable between and  as the company pursued initiatives that included implementing new on line banking services  developing products and service protocols that better target different customer groups  and evaluating overall organizational efficiency and effectiveness 
the decrease from to can be traced in large part to consulting services in the earlier period related to the company s entry into the houston  texas market 
amortization of purchased intangibles decreased million in compared to the million benefit from the elimination of goodwill amortization in was partly offset by amortization of the deposit relationship intangible purchased in the northwest bank acquisition in s fourth quarter and adjustments to the amortization schedule for certain other purchased intangibles 
the business acquisitions in and accounted for all of the increase in the amortization of intangibles in note to the consolidated financial statements presents pro forma information to show the impact elimination of goodwill amortization has on net income and earnings per share 
scheduled amortization of intangible assets other than goodwill in is million 
the expense for security and other outsourced services increased in after rising in the increase reflected in large part the extension of existing service arrangements to acquired operations 
toward the end of  whitney launched a multi faceted advertising campaign featuring a louisiana based celebrity spokesperson 
costs associated with this campaign  which continued throughout  contributed to the  or 
million  increase in advertising expense in the favorable impact of ongoing expense control efforts in recent years is evident in the stationery and supplies expense category which decreased in  following a moderate increase in the success of these efforts also factored into the moderate growth in other operating expense in both and the bank has been assessed at relatively low rates for deposit insurance premiums in recent years  reflecting both the level of the deposit insurance funds in relation to required levels and the favorable overall risk rating assigned to the bank by its primary regulator 
growth in insured deposits and higher estimates of potential insured losses by the fdic have lowered the ratio of deposit insurance funds to insured deposits and increased the likelihood that premium rates will go up 
the company and its acquired entities recognize various nonrecurring expenses to complete merger transactions and to integrate the acquired operations into the whitney system 
these merger related expenses include change in control payments and severance or retention bonuses for management and employees of a merged entity  investment banker fees  fees for various professional services and losses on cancellation of contracts and the disposition of obsolete and redundant facilities and equipment 
total merger related expenses vary with each transaction 
income taxes income tax expense was million in  million in and million in the company s effective tax rate was in  in and in these effective rates were lower than the federal statutory tax rate primarily because of tax exempt interest income received from the financing of state and local governments 
the increase from to mainly reflected the termination of the subchapter s election for post merger earnings from an acquired bank s operations  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the subchapter s termination  however  whitney also recorded a deferred tax benefit of approximately million in that partly offset the impact of the taxability of post merger earnings 
louisiana sourced income of commercial banks is not subject to state income taxes 
rather  banks in louisiana pay a tax based on the value of their capital stock in lieu of income and franchise taxes  and these ad valorem taxes are included in noninterest expense 
this expense will fluctuate based in part on the growth in the bank s equity and earnings and in part based on market valuation trends for the banking industry 
see note for additional information on the company s effective tax rates and the composition of changes in income tax expense for all periods 
fourth quarter results whitney earned 
per share  or million  in the fourth quarter of  a increase over earnings of 
per share  or million  in the fourth quarter of selected highlights from the fourth quarter s results follow o net interest income te increased  or 
million  from the fourth quarter of  on the strength of an improved net interest margin te that increased to  or basis points above the year earlier quarter 
earning assets decreased in total by less than between these periods 
although sustained lower market rates reduced both asset yields and funding costs  there was a deeper reduction in the cost of funds 
funding costs  which decreased basis points  benefited from a shift in the mix of funds to noninterest bearing and other lower cost sources 
changes in the earning asset mix helped moderate the decline in overall asset yields  which totaled basis points 
loans remained a relatively steady percentage of earning assets between these periods 
investment securities grew to of earning assets from in the year earlier period  with a comparable reduction in short term liquidity investments 
the growth in investment securities  which generally carry fixed rates  was concentrated in shorter duration mortgage backed issues 
o noninterest income  excluding securities transactions  increased  or million  from the fourth quarter of income from secondary mortgage market operations rose  or 
million  as production levels were again bolstered by a strong refinancing market 
expanded distribution and use of bank issued debit cards drove a  or 
million  increase in the credit card income category 
other contributors to noninterest income growth included fees on letters of credit and unused loan commitments  investment services income  and revenue from the official check outsourcing agreement  all of which increased a combined million 
difficult capital market conditions were the main factor behind a decline in trust service fees from s fourth quarter 
service charges from deposit accounts were also lower in the fourth quarter of by less than 
o noninterest expense increased  or million  from s fourth quarter 
a sharp increase in defined benefit pension plan expense was the main driver of a  or million  increase in total personnel expense from the fourth quarter of employee compensation increased a more moderate  or million  in total  as base salaries and targeted employee incentive pay rose  aided in part by a reduction in full time equivalent staff levels from year end most other major expense categories showed improvement from the fourth quarter of close control over capital expenditures has had a favorable impact on equipment and data processing expense  which decreased  or 
million  in s fourth quarter 
legal and professional fees were down 
million from the fourth quarter of  when system conversion expenses were incurred related to a merger 
the change in accounting for goodwill led to a 
million net decrease in amortization of purchased intangibles compared to the year earlier quarter 
o improvements in overall credit quality helped reduce the level of the allowance for loan losses by million from the end of the allowance represented of total loans at december   compared to a year earlier 
net charge offs totaled million in the fourth quarter of  and million in the fourth quarter of whitney provided 
million for loan losses in the fourth quarter of  compared to million in the final quarter of the provision in last year s fourth quarter reflected increased customer credit risks arising from  among other factors  a weakening economy and heightened uncertainty in the aftermath of the september terrorist attacks
