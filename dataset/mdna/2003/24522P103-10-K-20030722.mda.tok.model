the united states processed food industry is generally characterized by relatively stable growth based on modest price and population increases 
we believe that fundamentals for the overall packaged food industry are favorable since these products are generally considered to be staple items for consumers to purchase 
while consumption growth is predicted to be modest in the united states  we believe that certain product segments that address changing consumer needs  such as healthy snacking and packaged produce  offer opportunities for faster growth 
we face substantial competition throughout our product lines from numerous well established businesses operating nationally or regionally with single or multiple branded product lines  as well as from private label manufacturers  that compete for consumer preference  distribution  shelf space and merchandising support 
in general  we compete on the basis of quality  breadth of product line  brand awareness  price  taste  nutrition  variety  value added services such as inventory management services and convenience 
a number of our competitors have broader product lines and substantially greater financial and other resources available to them 
food producers have been impacted by two key trends affecting their retail customers consolidation and increased competitive pressures 
retailers are rationalizing costs in an effort to improve profitability  including efforts to reduce inventory levels  increase supply chain efficiency and decrease working capital requirements 
in addition  more traditional grocers have experienced increasing competition from rapidly growing club stores  supercenters and mass merchandisers  which offer every day low prices 
retailer customers generally offer a private label store brand in addition to offering the number one and number two national or regional brands in different product categories 
sustaining strong relationships with retailers has become a critical success factor for food companies and is driving initiatives such as category and inventory management 
food companies that offer such value added services have been able to increase shelf space  maximize distribution efficiencies  further strengthen their relationships with retailers and maintain their leadership positions

in the fall of  we plan to commence soup and broth production at our mendota  il facility  increasing the capacity and capabilities of our production matrix 
previously  soup was produced for us at a third party plant in muscatine  ia  which provided product to us as a co packer for a period after the merger 
we also use co packers to provide additional capacity and packaging capabilities for our infant feeding product portfolio 
all of our co packers are located in north america

in connection with our efforts to integrate the acquired businesses into del monte  we have selected common platforms for our enterprise resource planning erp  supply chain planning  and trade spending management and financial planning and reporting systems 
as part of our evaluation of different platforms  we considered various effects of the integration  including disruption to our business  cost effectiveness short and long term  time required to integrate and deliver synergies and ability to evolve our operational model

governmental regulation  environmental compliance as a manufacturer and marketer of food products  our operations are subject to extensive regulation by various federal government agencies  including the food and drug administration  the united states department of agriculture and the federal trade commission ftc  as well as state and local agencies  with respect to production processes  product attributes  packaging  labeling  storage and distribution 
under various statutes and regulations  these agencies prescribe requirements and establish standards for safety  purity and labeling 
our products must comply with all applicable laws and regulations  including food and drug laws  of the jurisdictions in which they are manufactured and marketed  such as the federal food  drug and cosmetic act of  as amended and the federal fair packaging and labeling act of  as amended 
in addition  advertising of our products is subject to regulation by the ftc  and our operations are subject to certain health and safety regulations  including those issued under the occupational safety and health act 
our manufacturing facilities and products are subject to periodic inspection by federal  state and local authorities 
we seek to comply at all times with all such laws and regulations and to obtain any necessary permits and licenses  and we are not aware of any instances of material non compliance 
we believe our facilities and practices are sufficient to maintain compliance with current applicable governmental laws  regulations  permits and licenses 
nevertheless  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations or requirements for necessary permits and licenses 
our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or obtain any necessary permits and licenses could subject us to civil remedies including fines  injunctions  recalls or seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions 
as a result of our agricultural  food processing and canning activities  we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations govern the treatment  handling  storage and disposal of materials and waste and the remediation of contaminated properties 
violations or non compliance with these laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines or civil liability against us by governmental entities or private parties 
we seek to comply at all times with all of these laws and regulations and are not aware of any instances of material non compliance 
outside the united states  we are also subject to applicable multi national  national and local environmental laws and regulations in the host countries where we do business 
we have specific programs across our international business units designed to meet compliance with requirements in the environmental area 
however  we cannot predict the extent to which the enforcement of any existing or future environmental law or regulation may affect our operations 
among the environmental matters currently affecting us are the following we are conducting groundwater remediation at our stockton  ca property associated with petroleum hydrocarbon contamination that resulted from the operations of a prior owner of the property 
after consultation with governmental authorities  we have selected and begun implementation of a remedial alternative 
at the present time  we are unable to predict the total cost for the remediation 
further  investigation and remediation of environmental conditions may be required in the future at other properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us 
nonetheless  based on current information  we 
table of contents do not expect that the costs associated with the stockton  ca remediation or any other potential future remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
governmental authorities and private claimants have notified us that we may be liable for environmental investigation and remediation costs at certain contaminated sites  including certain third party sites at which we disposed of wastes 
we may be liable for remediation costs at these sites as a result of alleged leaks  spills  releases or disposal of certain wastes or other substances at these sites 
with respect to a majority of these sites  we have settled our liability 
based upon the information currently available  we do not expect that our liability for the remaining sites will be material 
we may receive additional claims that we are potentially liable for environmental investigation and remediation costs at other sites in the future 
we expect to perform soil and groundwater investigation and remediation at our terminal island  ca property as part of the closure and demolition of a facility which was operated by a joint venture to which starkist was a party 
we assumed this liability pursuant to the merger agreement 
we are in an early stage of consultation with the port of los angeles  which owns the property on which this facility was located  regarding the nature and scope of the investigation and remediation to be performed 
at the present time  we are unable to predict the total cost for the investigation and remediation 
nonetheless  based on current information  we do not expect that the costs associated with this investigation and remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
our environmental expenditures in recent years have related to wastewater treatment systems  settlement of environmental litigation and underground storage tank ust remediation activities 
we project that we will spend approximately million in fiscal on capital projects and other expenditures in connection with environmental compliance  primarily for boiler upgrades  compliance costs related to the consolidation of our fruit and tomato processing operations and continued ust remediation activities 
we believe that our environmental liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
the marine mammal protection act of and the regulations under this act regulate the incidental taking of dolphin in the course of fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical pacific ocean  where a portion of our light meat tuna is caught 
in  the starkist seafood business  under the heinz organization  voluntarily adopted a worldwide policy not to purchase tuna caught in the eastern tropical pacific ocean through the intentional encirclement of dolphin by purse seine nets and reaffirmed its policy not to purchase tuna caught anywhere using gill nets or drift nets 
also in  the dolphin protection consumer information act was enacted regulating the labeling of tuna products as dolphin safe and bans the importation of tuna caught using high seas drift nets 
the marine mammal protection act was amended in to further regulate tuna fishing methods that involve marine mammals 
compliance with these laws and regulations and starkist seafood s voluntary policy has not had  and is not expected to have  a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
in  congress passed the international dolphin conservation program act  which modified the regulation of the incidental taking of dolphins in the course of fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical pacific ocean and revised the definition of dolphin safe 
despite the passage of the less restrictive international dolphin conservation program act  we remain committed to the more dolphin friendly standards of the marine mammal protection act 
revision of the definition of dolphin safe and modification of the regulation of the incidental taking of dolphins in the course of fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical pacific ocean have not had  and management does not expect them to have  a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
working capital we maintain a revolving line of credit to fund our working capital needs 
our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future based upon a number of factors 
our working capital requirements are seasonally affected by the growing cycle of some of the products we process 
our inventory 
table of contents position for these products is also seasonally affected by this growing cycle 
the vast majority of del monte brands inventories are produced during the harvesting and packing months of june through october and depleted through the remaining seven months 
seafood  pet  and soup and infant feeding products are produced throughout the year 
accordingly  our working capital requirements can fluctuate significantly throughout the year 
prior to the merger  heinz performed the cash management function for the acquired businesses  including sweeps of available cash held in excess of obligations 
these transactions are shown as net parent settlements in our statements of cash flows 
employees we employ approximately  full time employees in the us and abroad 
in addition  temporary seasonal workers are hired during the del monte brands pack season  typically june through october  adding approximately  seasonal employees to our workforce during those months 
we consider our relationship with our employees to be good 
we have collective bargaining agreements with union locals covering approximately of our hourly full time and seasonal employees 
of these employees  approximately are covered under a collective bargaining agreement scheduled to expire in september of  and approximately are covered under four collective bargaining agreements scheduled to expire in calendar year these agreements are subject to negotiation and renewal 
failure to renew any of these collective bargaining agreements may result in a strike or work stoppage that could materially adversely affect our operations

table of contents factors that may affect our future results and stock price our business and our stock price are subject to many risks and uncertainties that may affect our future financial performance 
some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our operating results to vary or that may materially or adversely affect our operating results or stock price are discussed below 
if we do not successfully integrate our businesses  we may not realize the expected benefits of the merger 
there is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating the acquired businesses with our existing businesses 
these difficulties include the challenge of accomplishing this integration while managing the ongoing operations of each business  the necessity of coordinating geographically separate organizations  the challenge of integrating the business cultures of each company  which may prove to be incompatible  and the need to retain key officers and personnel of our existing businesses and the acquired businesses 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully or cost effectively integrate the acquired businesses and our existing businesses 
the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of one or more of the acquired businesses and our existing businesses 
members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process  which will decrease the time they will have to manage our businesses  service existing customers  attract new customers and develop new products 
if our senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process  or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process  our business could suffer 
our failure to successfully  or cost effectively  implement uniform controls  systems and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
as a result of the merger  we have more than twice the sales on a pro forma basis assuming the merger occurred at the beginning of fiscal  assets  employees and market capitalization as before the merger 
in addition  our range of products  customers and competitors has significantly expanded from those before the merger 
as part of the integration process  we must significantly expand the scope of our operational and financial systems  which will increase our operating complexity 
implementation of uniform controls  systems and procedures may be costly and time consuming 
our failure to implement uniform controls  systems and procedures in a cost effective manner or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we are dependent on heinz to provide certain transitional services to the acquired businesses and any failure by heinz to fulfill its obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial ability and results of operations 
we presently receive the following transitional services from heinz payroll and employee benefits administration for hourly and salaried employees of the acquired businesses 
we anticipate that we will utilize these services through at least the end of calendar year financial  administrative and sales services for our pet products and veterinary pet businesses in canada 
the agreement to provide these services is subject to annual renewal and can be terminated with six months notice 

table of contents brokerage services for our seafood and soup and infant feeding foodservice sales 
these services will be terminated by the end of calendar year we cannot assure you that  at the end of the periods during which heinz will provide the transitional services listed above  we will be able to perform these services in a cost effective manner or that we will be able to obtain these services from third parties on favorable terms or at all 
heinz s failure to provide these services for us or obtain these services from a third party  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
additionally  under the separation agreement and trademark license agreement we have the right to use the heinz brand name  tradename and domain name for a limited transitional period 
we cannot assure you that at the end of the periods covered by these agreements we will be able to comply with such restrictions or obtain appropriate labels and packaging 
any failure to do so could adversely affect our business 
we may not realize the expected cost savings and other benefits from the merger 
we expect to realize cost savings and other financial and operating benefits as a result of the merger 
however  we cannot predict with certainty when these cost savings and benefits will occur  or the extent to which they actually will be achieved 
realization of any benefits and savings could be affected by a number of factors beyond our control  including  without limitation  general economic conditions  increased operating costs  the response of competitors and regulatory developments 
in addition  we expect that the realization of certain benefits as a result of the merger will depend on our taking actions that will result in charges or expenses 
we expect to incur significant costs related to the integration of the acquired businesses that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we have incurred and we anticipate that we will continue to incur significant costs in connection with the integration of the acquired businesses with our existing businesses 
these expenses may have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the period in which they are recorded 
we cannot assure you that any benefits or cost savings we expect to realize as a result of the integration of the acquired businesses will offset these expenses 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness  causing us to be highly leveraged 
as of april   we had a total of  million of indebtedness 
our indebtedness could have important consequences  such as limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund growth  working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other cash requirements  limiting our operational flexibility due to the covenants contained in our debt agreements  limiting our ability to invest operating cash flow in our business due to debt service requirements  limiting our ability to compete with companies that are not as highly leveraged and that may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns  increasing our vulnerability to economic downturns and changing market conditions  and to the extent that our debt is subject to floating interest rates  increasing our vulnerability to fluctuations in market interest rates 

table of contents we expect to generate the funds necessary to pay our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt from our operations 
because portions of our business are highly seasonal  our borrowings fluctuate significantly during the year  generally peaking in september and october 
our ability to meet our expenses and debt service obligations will depend on our future performance  which will be affected by financial  business  economic  legislative  regulatory and other factors  including potential changes in consumer preferences  the success of product and marketing innovation and pressure from competitors 
if we do not have enough money to pay our debt service obligations  we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt  sell assets  borrow more money or raise equity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able  at any given time  to refinance our debt  sell assets  borrow more money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us or at all 
despite our significant indebtedness  we may still be able to incur substantially more debt through additional borrowings 
this could further exacerbate the risks described above 
while our credit agreement generally restricts additional borrowing outside the existing facilities  it permits additional indebtedness pursuant to specified exceptions  including a general exception for additional indebtedness in an amount up to million at any time outstanding 
in addition  if we obtain the approval of our senior lenders and satisfy debt incurrence tests contained in our two senior subordinated note indentures  we could incur substantial additional senior or subordinated indebtedness  for example  in connection with an acquisition 
if our current debt level is increased  the related risks that we currently face could intensify 
we are subject to restrictive debt covenants  which may restrict our operational flexibility 
our ability to comply with these restrictions depends on many factors beyond our control 
our credit facilities contain covenants that restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  issue capital stock  pay dividends on and redeem our capital stock  make other restricted payments  including investments  sell our assets  incur liens  transfer all or substantially all of our assets and enter into consolidations or mergers 
our credit facilities also require us to maintain specified financial ratios 
our ability to meet those financial ratios may be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will meet those ratios 
a breach of any of the covenants  ratios  or restrictions under our credit facilities could result in an event of default under the credit facilities  in which case  the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facilities to be immediately due and payable 
if the lenders under the credit facilities accelerate the payment of the indebtedness thereunder  we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and any other indebtedness that would become due as a result of any acceleration which  upon such an acceleration  would include the indebtedness pursuant to the senior subordinated notes 
we have pledged substantially all of our assets to secure our bank debt 
in addition  our existing indentures contain covenants that restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  issue capital stock  pay dividends on and redeem capital stock  make other restricted payments  including investments  sell our assets  transfer all or substantially all of our assets and enter into consolidations  or mergers 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under our existing indentures  in which case all amounts outstanding under the indentures and credit facilities could be declared immediately due and payable 
if the payment of this indebtedness is accelerated  we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and any other indebtedness  including indebtedness under the credit facilities  that would become due as a result of any acceleration 
we may be prevented from taking certain corporate actions in order to avoid significant tax related liabilities 
even if the spin off otherwise qualifies as a tax free reorganization  the distribution may not qualify as a transaction that is tax free to heinz if or more of the stock of heinz or del monte foods company is acquired as part of a plan that includes the spin off 
we entered into a tax separation agreement with heinz and skf foods in connection with the spin off that provides that  for a two year period following the spin off  we will avoid taking certain corporate actions that 
table of contents might cause the distribution to be treated as part of a plan pursuant to which or more of dmfc s stock is acquired 
corporate actions subject to the restrictions include our liquidation  merger or consolidation with or into any other corporation  the sale  exchange  distribution or disposition of other than in the ordinary course of business all or a substantial part of the acquired businesses  the redemption  purchase or acquisition by us of our capital stock  the issuance by us of our capital stock  the discontinuance of the operations of the acquired businesses  or any negotiations  agreements or arrangements with respect to any of the foregoing 
the tax separation agreement also obligates us to indemnify heinz for any taxes resulting from the violation of these restrictions or from disqualification of the spin off attributable to any actions taken by del monte 
if the operating results for the acquired businesses after the merger do not improve  we may not be able to realize the full anticipated benefits of the merger 
we expect to derive a significant portion of our net sales and net income from the operations of the acquired businesses 
in recent years  including fiscal  sales from the acquired businesses have decreased and the acquired businesses have lost market share in several of their product lines  including pet food and infant feeding 
to reverse this trend  we expect to expend significant effort and resources on product improvement and sales and marketing efforts relating to the acquired businesses 
these efforts to improve the results of operations of the acquired businesses and to increase the market share of their product lines may not be successful 
if these efforts are not successful  our business  operating results and our projected performance may be adversely impacted 
we entered into new lines of business through the merger with which some of our management may not be familiar and which may require substantial management resources 
our range of products and services  scope of operations  competitors and suppliers is significantly different from those before the merger 
accordingly  our results of operations and prospects  as well as our stock price  may be affected by factors that are different from those that have historically affected us 
in particular  the acquired businesses have risks that are different from those we have encountered in the past and our management may not be able to manage these risks effectively 
for example  the procurement process and regulatory structure of our tuna business differ significantly from those applicable to our fruit  vegetable and tomato businesses 
in addition  we have acceded to many supply and production arrangements in market segments and with counterparties with which we are not familiar 
some of these relationships may be informal  and  without an obligation to do so  the counterparties may not choose to continue the supply or production relationship with us 
effective management of these new supply chains and new production relationships in new markets may require substantial time and resources 
if we fail to effectively manage these new challenges  our results of operation and stock price may be materially adversely affected 
consumers may not react favorably to the re branding of our primary infant feeding product 
in connection with the merger  we received an eighteen month license to continue using the heinz brand name on our line of nature s goodness infant feeding products 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully re brand this product without adverse consumer reaction and without a decline in sales 
we are currently conducting research to develop our rebranding strategy 

table of contents because we are dependent upon a limited number of customers  the loss of a significant customer could adversely affect our operating results 
a relatively limited number of customers account for a large percentage of our total net sales  including the sales of the acquired businesses 
during fiscal  our top customer  wal mart  represented approximately of sales  and our ten largest customers represented approximately of sales 
these percentages may increase if the recent trends of consolidation among food retailers and the growth of mass merchandisers continue 
we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a small number of customers 
these customers do not typically enter into long term contracts and generally purchase our products as the customer s current inventory levels are depleted 
these customers make purchase decisions based on a combination of price  product quality and customer service performance 
if our sales of products to one or more of these customers are reduced  this reduction may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
loss of a significant customer could also adversely affect our reputation 
as the consolidation trend among food retailers continues and our retail customers  including mass merchandisers  grow larger and become more sophisticated  these food retailers may demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs from product suppliers 
if we are not selected by these food retailers for most of our products or if we fail to effectively respond to their demands  our sales and profitability could be adversely affected 
our business could be affected adversely by the bankruptcy of fleming companies  inc on april   fleming companies  inc  et al fleming filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware 
fleming is one of our top customers  by sales  for fiscal year we have established a reserve of million  which is the portion of pre petition amount fleming owes to us that we estimate we may not recover 
as is customary during a bankruptcy proceeding  payments made by fleming during the period days prior to the date of the bankruptcy filing may be subject to challenge by fleming  its creditors or others acting on behalf of fleming s bankruptcy estate  asserting that all or part of such payments are preferential under federal bankruptcy law 
although no complaint to recover the transfers as alleged preferences has been filed or threatened  if such a suit were filed  it could result in additional exposure 
we continue to do business with fleming while they are in bankruptcy on a cash in advance basis 
although we are not now evaluating whether or not to resume extending credit to fleming  we may in the future undertake such an evaluation 
we cannot assure amounts  if any  we advance to fleming in the future will be repaid 
any potential future write off of amounts owed to us by fleming could adversely affect our operating results 
our operating results will depend  in part  on the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising programs 
we expect to expend significant marketing and advertising resources on a number of our businesses  including pet products and tuna pouch products  which we believe are in product categories that are very responsive to marketing and advertising 
accordingly  the effectiveness of our marketing practices and advertising campaigns will be important to our ability to retain and expand our market share 
if our marketing and advertising campaigns are not successful  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences  which may result in decreased demand for our products 
our success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing tastes  dietary habits and product packaging preferences of consumers in the market categories in which we compete 
if we are not able to anticipate  identify or develop and market products that respond to these changes in consumer preferences  demand for our products may decline and our operating results may be adversely affected 

table of contents the insurance industry has become more selective in offering certain types of insurance coverage and we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future 
the insurance industry has become more selective in offering certain types of insurance coverage  such as property  product liability  product recall and directors and officers liability 
we were able to obtain these insurance coverages for fiscal  and our fiscal insurance program is consistent with both our past level of coverage and our risk management policies 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain comparable insurance coverage at favorable terms  or at all  in the future 
we use a single national broker to represent our branded products to the retail grocery trade and any failure by the broker to effectively represent us would adversely affect our business 
we use a single national broker to represent our branded products to the retail grocery trade 
we believe that a single broker is able to more effectively represent our branded products to the increasingly consolidated retail grocery trade 
however  our business would suffer substantial disruption if our broker were to default in the performance of its obligations to perform brokerage services 
our business would be adversely affected if our broker fails to effectively represent us to the retail grocery trade 
if we do not compete successfully and maintain the market shares of our products  our business and revenues may be adversely affected 
our businesses are highly competitive 
there are numerous brands and products that compete for shelf space and sales  with competition based primarily on brand recognition  price  product quality  taste  variety and convenience 
we compete with a significant number of companies of varying sizes  including divisions or subsidiaries of larger companies 
our products also face strong competition from imports  regional brands  private label products and fresh alternatives 
a number of our competitors have broader product lines  substantially greater financial and other resources  lower fixed costs and or longer operating histories than we do 
our competitors may succeed in developing new or enhanced products that are more attractive to consumers than ours 
these competitors may also prove to be more successful in marketing and selling their products than we are 
we cannot assure you that we can compete successfully with these other companies 
we cannot predict the pricing or promotional activities of our competitors or whether they will have a negative effect on us 
there are competitive pressures and other factors which could cause our products to lose market share or result in significant price erosion  and thus have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to successfully complete or implement future acquisitions  which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our acquisition strategy to take advantage of opportunities to acquire companies in our categories or other branded categories depends on the availability of suitable acquisition candidates  and we may be unable to identify suitable opportunistic targets for acquisition 
if we identify a suitable acquisition candidate  our ability to successfully implement the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and to comply with the restrictions contained in our debt agreements 
if we need to obtain our lenders consent to an acquisition  they may condition their consent on our compliance with additional restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility 
acquisitions involve risks  including those associated with integrating the operations  disparate technologies and personnel of acquired companies  managing geographically dispersed operations  and the potential loss of key employees  customers and strategic partners of acquired companies 
we may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits 
acquisitions may be expensive  time consuming and may strain our resources 
acquisitions may not initially be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our operating results 
additionally  because we already face a number of integration hurdles in connection with the acquisition of the acquired businesses  investors may react unfavorably to any future announced acquisitions 

table of contents we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategies to reduce costs and increase product distribution to high volume club stores and mass merchandisers 
the success of our business strategy depends in part on our ability to reduce costs 
if we are not able to complete projects designed to reduce costs and increase operating efficiency on time or within budget  if at all  our operating results could be adversely impacted 
the success of our business strategy also depends on our ability to increase sales of our products  and to increase product distribution through high volume club stores  such as sam s club and costco  supercenters and mass merchandisers  such as wal mart supercenters 
if we are unable to increase sales and product distribution through these channels our operating results could be adversely impacted 
the commodity raw materials that we require are subject to price increases that could adversely affect our profitability 
the primary raw materials that we use  such as fruits  vegetables  tomatoes  tuna  grain  sugar  spice  steel  meat and dairy products  are commodities that may experience price volatility caused by external conditions  commodity market fluctuations  availability  currency fluctuations and changes in governmental regulations and agricultural programs 
severe and prolonged weather conditions and natural disasters  such as floods  droughts  frosts  disease  earthquakes and el nino  may affect the cost and supply of our raw materials 
similarly  prices for commodities such as steel and meat by products are subject to factors outside our control  such as import restrictions 
additionally  some scientists believe that the population of larger more mature fish  particularly among the larger fish species  have been dramatically depleted due to overfishing  potentially affecting the current and future supply of tuna and other seafood 
these events can result in reduced supplies of raw materials  higher supply costs or interruptions in our production schedules 
if prices of these raw materials increase  but we are not able to effectively pass such price increases along to our customers  our operating income will decrease 
if we are subject to product liability claims  we may incur significant and unexpected costs and our business reputation could be adversely affected 
we may be exposed to product liability claims and adverse public relations if consumption of our products is alleged to cause injury or illness 
if a product liability claim is successful  our insurance may not be adequate to cover all liabilities we may incur and we may not be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost  if at all 
a product liability judgment against us could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures which would reduce operating profit and cash flow 
in addition  even if product liability claims against us are not successful or are not fully pursued  these claims would likely be costly and time consuming and may require management to spend time defending the claims rather than operating our business 
product liability claims  or any other events that cause consumers to no longer associate our brands with high quality and safe products  may hurt the value of our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products 
product liability claims may also lead to increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies of our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our brands  business  results of operations and financial condition 
our operating results are negatively impacted by the current trend of our customers to reduce their levels of inventory 
our trade customers have been reducing their inventory levels significantly during the past several fiscal years 
as a result  our sales to trade customers are less than the volume of purchases of our products by consumers 
the effect of this trend was significant in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as trade customers reduced the inventory levels they had built in preparation for possible year shortages 
the inventory reduction continued through and is expected to continue by varying degrees into the future 
the reduction of retailer inventory levels decreased our shipments and adversely affected our growth  gross margin and working capital requirements 
if the trend of reducing trade inventory levels continues  it could adversely affect our operating results 

table of contents severe weather conditions and natural disasters can affect crop supplies and reduce our operating results 
severe weather conditions and natural disasters  such as floods  droughts  frosts  earthquakes or pestilence  may affect the supply of our products 
irregular weather patterns may persist over a long period and further impact the supply of our products 
these events can result in reduced supplies of raw materials  lower recoveries of usable raw materials  higher costs of cold storage if harvests are accelerated and processing capacity is unavailable or interruptions in our production schedules if harvests are delayed 
competing manufacturers can be affected differently by weather conditions and natural disasters depending on the location of their supplies 
if our supplies of raw materials are reduced  we may not be able to find enough supplemental supply sources on favorable terms  which could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our del monte brands operating segment s operating results are highly seasonal 
interference with our production schedule during peak months could negatively impact our operating results 
we do not manufacture the majority of our del monte brands products continuously throughout the year  but instead have a seasonal production period that is limited to approximately three to four months primarily during the summer each year 
our working capital requirements related to these businesses are also seasonal and are highest in the first and second fiscal quarters 
an unexpected plant shutdown or any other material interference with our production schedule could adversely affect our operating results 
our del monte brands sales tend to peak in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year  mainly as a result of the holiday period in november and december and the easter holiday 
by contrast  in the first fiscal quarter of each year  sales are generally lower  mainly due to less promotional activity and the availability of fresh produce 
we believe that the main trends in our operating results are relatively predictable and that we have adequate sources of liquidity to fund operations during periods of low sales 
if these trends were to change or be disrupted  however  our operating results could be adversely affected  and we could require additional sources of liquidity to fund our working capital and other cash requirements 
we rely upon co packers to provide our supply of certain products and any failure by co packers to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect our financial performance 
we have a number of supply agreements with co packers that require them to provide us with certain finished products 
the failure of any such co packer to fulfill their obligations under the applicable agreements could result in disruptions to our supply of finished goods and have an adverse effect on our financial performance 
the terms in our supply agreement with impress could adversely affect the profitability of our products 
impress supplies metal cans and ends for our pet and seafood businesses 
our agreement with impress includes certain minimum volume purchase requirements and guarantees a certain minimum financial return to impress 
these terms may result in increases in the unit costs of our pet and seafood products if we reduce our production levels 
our ability to competitively serve our customers depends on the availability of reliable and low cost transportation 
disruption of the supply of these services and or significant increases in the cost of these services could impact our operating results 
we use multiple forms of transportation to bring our products to market 
they include ocean  truck  intermodal  and railcar 
disruption to the timely supply of these services or significant increases in the cost of these services for any reason including availability of fuel  could have an adverse effect on our ability to serve our customers  and consumers and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance 

table of contents we are subject to environmental regulation and environmental risks  which may adversely affect our business 
as a result of our agricultural  food processing and canning activities  we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations 
many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent and compliance with them is becoming increasingly expensive 
we cannot predict the extent to which any environmental law or regulation that may be enacted or enforced in the future may affect our operations 
we have been named as a potentially responsible party prp and may be liable for environmental investigation and remediation costs at certain designated superfund sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla  or under similar state laws 
we are defending ourselves in these actions as we believe appropriate 
however  we cannot assure you that none of these matters will adversely impact our financial position or results of operations 
we may in the future be named as a prp at other currently or previously owned or operated sites  and additional remediation requirements could be imposed on us 
other properties where we conduct or have conducted operations could be identified for investigation or proposed for listing under cercla or similar state laws 
also  under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and the food quality protection act of  the us environmental protection agency is involved in a series of regulatory actions relating to the evaluation and use of pesticides in the food industry 
the effect of such actions and future actions on the availability and use of pesticides could adversely impact our financial position or results of operations 
if the cost of compliance with applicable environmental laws or regulations increases  our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
government regulation could increase our costs of production and increase legal and regulatory expenses 
the manufacture  processing  packaging  storage  distribution and labeling of food products are subject to extensive federal  state and local regulation 
these aspects of our operations are regulated by the food and drug administration fda  the united states department of agriculture and various local and state health and agricultural agencies 
in addition  some of our facilities are subject to continuous on site inspections 
failure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations  including among others california s proposition  could subject us to civil remedies  including fines  injunctions  recalls or seizures  as well as potential criminal sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is also affected by import and export controls and similar laws and regulations 
issues such as national security or mad cow disease which slow or otherwise restrict imports could adversely affect our business 
in addition  the modification of existing laws or regulations could require us to make material expenditures or otherwise adversely affect the way that we have historically operated our business 
concerns  well founded or not  regarding methyl mercury in seafood products  including tuna  could adversely affect our business 
according to the fda and other government health agencies  trace amounts of methyl mercury are not harmful to humans but methyl mercury may damage the human nervous system if consumed in quantities in excess of certain proscribed limits 
noting that a fetus may be more susceptible than its mother to the potential adverse effects of methyl mercury  the fda has established lower consumption limits for certain foods containing methyl mercury  such as shark and swordfish  for pregnant women and women of childbearing age 
due to mercury in the world s oceans  tuna may contain methyl mercury  with higher concentrations found in bigger fish 
accordingly  blue fin tuna tends to have a higher level of methyl mercury than albacore or white tuna  which in turn tends to have a higher level than light tuna which is predominantly made up of smaller tuna such as skipjack 
to date  given average levels of consumption  the fda has not issued consumption advice regarding canned tuna 
warnings regarding mercury levels in seafood  including tuna  however appear in the popular press 
consumer perceptions that consumption of canned tuna should be limited may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
additionally  california has statutes commonly referred to as proposition requiring that clear and reasonable warnings be given to persons who are exposed to chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity  including methyl mercury 
although we have sought to comply with proposition requirements  there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely affected by litigation relating to proposition 
table of contents if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights  we may harm our ability to compete 
our brand names and trademarks  including the marks del monte  starkist  lives and kibbles n bits  are important to our business 
we rely on copyright  trademark  trade secret  patent and other intellectual property laws  as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary information  technologies and processes 
we also have obligations with respect to the non use and non disclosure of third party intellectual property 
we may need to engage in litigation or similar activities to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could require us to expend significant resources and divert the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel from our business operations 
we cannot assure you that the steps we will take to prevent misappropriation  infringement or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of others will be successful 
in addition  effective patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for some of our trademarks and patents in some foreign countries 
failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our business and results of operations 
our del monte brand name could be confused with names of other companies who  by their act or omission  could adversely affect the value of the del monte brand name 
we have licensed the del monte brand name to various unaffiliated companies internationally and  for some products  in the united states 
the common stock of one licensee  fresh del monte produce inc  is publicly traded in the united states 
acts or omissions by these unaffiliated companies may adversely affect the value of the del monte brand name  the trading prices for our common stock and demand for our products 
third party announcements or rumors about these licensees could also have these negative effects 
in addition  in connection with the merger  heinz retained its ownership of some of the brand names used by the acquired businesses in countries in which we do not compete 
acts or omissions by heinz or its licensees that adversely affect the value of these brand names may also adversely affect demand for our products 
we acquired the starkist brand name in north america only and activities by other companies could adversely affect  by their act or omission  the value of the starkist brand name 
acts or omissions by unaffiliated companies who hold the starkist brand name outside north america may adversely affect the value of the starkist brand name and demand for our products 
third party announcements or rumors about these companies or their products could also have these negative effects 
our business may be significantly disrupted if our new systems platform is not integrated successfully 
in april  a decision was made by management to implement a new single systems platform for del monte following the merger 
the new platform will combine certain systems previously implemented under del monte s capability improvement program and other systems acquired from heinz in the merger 
we have approved the information technology integration project which will implement the single systems platform throughout the company 
this project has a budget of million  including million of expense and million of capital expenditures  and is scheduled to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal year  with final completion in fiscal significant disruptions to our business may result if the project does not work as expected  if implementation is delayed or if our personnel are unable to effectively adapt to new programs and processes 
our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
our success will depend on our ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  including executive officers and other key management personnel 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel necessary for the development  manufacture and sale of our 
table of contents products or that key employees will remain with del monte 
if those employees are not retained by us  we may experience substantial disruption in our business 
the loss of key management personnel or other key employees or our inability to attract such personnel may adversely affect our ability to manage our overall operations and successfully implement our business strategy 
our business could be harmed by strikes or work stoppages by del monte employees 
we have collective bargaining agreements with union locals covering approximately  of our hourly full time and seasonal employees 
of these employees  approximately are covered under a collective bargaining agreement scheduled to expire in september of  and approximately are covered under four collective bargaining agreements that are scheduled to expire in calendar year if a strike or work stoppage were to occur in connection with negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements  or as a result of disputes under our collective bargaining agreements with labor unions  our business could be substantially adversely affected
