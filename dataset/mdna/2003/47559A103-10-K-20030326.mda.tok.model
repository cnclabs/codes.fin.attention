financial condition total assets increased by million or to million at december  from million at december  the increase was primarily due to a million or increase in securities available for sale from million at december  to million at december  gross loans outstanding increased million from million at december  to million at december  the investment in bank owned life insurance increased million primarily due to purchases of additional insurance 
these asset increases were funded by a million increase in total deposits from million at december  to million at december  much of the securities portfolio remains funded with long term borrowings from the federal homeloan bank  a leveraging strategy implemented since in which the company funded security purchases with fhlb borrowings at a positive interest rate spread 
in  total gross loans increased million or from million to million 
within the loan portfolio  commercial real estate loans increased million to million at december   residential real estate increased by million to million  home equity loans increased million to million and real estate construction loans decreased million to million 
the real estate growth reflects the company s strategy to provide loans for local real estate projects where there is strong loan to values and solid principals 
the growth in residential mortgages reflects new products to meet the highly competitive nature of this market 
as a result of casino gambling proposals and related local economic improvement  the company anticipates continued residential and commercial real estate loan opportunities 
accordingly  additional growth is anticipated in real estate loans during the overall loan portfolio is structured in accordance with management s belief that loans secured by residential and commercial real estate generally result in lower loan loss levels compared to other types of loans  because of the value of the underlying collateral 
in the event that the casino gambling proposals do not progress  collateral underlying certain real estate projects could lose value 
other real estate owned at december  was  compared to million at december  during the third quarter of  the bank obtained a deed in lieu of foreclosure to condominium units at the grandview palace in loch sheldrake  new york

total deposits increased million to million at december  from million at december  within the deposit mix  lower costing core deposits increased while there was a decrease in higher costing time deposits 
much of the increase in deposits was caused by the continued growth of new branches and the attraction of new customers from larger regional banks 
the company continues to be successful in increasing demand deposit balances  which provides a pool of low cost funds for reinvestment opportunities 
demand deposits increased from million at december  to million at december   an increase of million or total stockholders equity was million at december   an increase of million from december  the increase was due primarily to net income and the increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of  reduced by cash dividends of  results of operations versus net income net income for of million increased or million from the net income of million 
the higher level of earnings in reflects the interaction of a number of factors 
the most significant factor which increased net income was the decrease in interest expense to million from million in  an decrease of million or 
an additional factor was the increase in interest income to million from million in  an increase of  or

interest income and interest expense throughout the following discussion  net interest income and its components are expressed on a tax equivalent basis which means that  where appropriate  tax exempt income is shown as if it were earned on a fully taxable basis 
the largest source of income for the company is net interest income  which represents interest earned on loans  securities and short term investments  less interest paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
tax equivalent net interest income of million for represented an increase of compared to million for net interest margin increased to in compared to in  as decreases in cost of deposits and borrowings exceeded decreases in earning asset yields

interest income from the increase in earning assets was offset by an overall decrease in average yield on earning assets of basis points in total average securities securities available for sale and securities held to maturity increased million or in to million 
the increase in reflects the investment of excess funds from increased deposits  which were not needed to fund new loans

interest rates on interest bearing deposits decreased from an average rate paid of in to in in  average demand deposit balances increased over provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses was  in as compared to  in provisions for loan losses are recorded to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level deemed adequate by management based on an evaluation of such factors as economic conditions in the company s market area  past loan loss experience  the financial condition of individual borrowers  and underlying collateral values based on independent appraisals 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions  particularly in sullivan county 
in addition  federal regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses and may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination  which may not be currently available to management 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes that the collectibility of all or a portion of the principal is unlikely 
recoveries of loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance when realized 
total non performing loans increased from million at december  to million at december  this increase was primarily due to increases in non accrual loans in the residential and commercial loan portfolios 
net loan charge offs increased from  in to  in while gross charge offs increased from  in to  in one commercial loan charge off of  represents of total gross charge offs for summary of loan loss experience the following table indicates the amount of charge offs and recoveries in the loan portfolio by category

management strives to identify potential non performing loans early  take charge offs promptly based on a realistic assessment of probable losses  and maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses based on the inherent risk of loss in the existing portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses was million at december  compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the allowance as a percentage of total loans was at december   compared to and at december  and  respectively 
the allowance s coverage of non performing loans was at december  compared to and at december  and respectively 
no portion of the allowance for loan losses is restricted to any loan or group of loans  as the entire allowance is available to absorb charge offs in any loan category 
the amount and timing of future charge offs and allowance allocations may vary from current estimates and will depend on local economic conditions

management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate  however  certain regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination  which may not be currently available to management 
nonaccrual and past due loans the company places a loan on nonaccrual status when collectability of principal or interest is doubtful  or when either principal or interest is days or more past due and the loan is not well secured and in the process of collection 
interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied as a reduction of the principal balance when concern exists as to the ultimate collection of principal 
a distribution of nonaccrual loans and loans days or more past due and still accruing interest is shown in the following table

percentage of total nonaccrual and day past due loans 
the increase in total non performing loans is primarily due to increases in past due residential mortgages and commercial loans 
total nonaccrual and day past due residential and commercial loans represent and of the respective portfolio totals  a deterioration over last year 
the majority of the company s total nonaccrual and past due loans are secured loans and  as such  management anticipates there will be limited risk of loss in their ultimate resolution 
from time to time  loans may be renegotiated in a troubled debt restructuring when the company determines that it will ultimately receive greater economic value under the new terms than through foreclosure  liquidation  or bankruptcy 
candidates for renegotiation must meet specific guidelines

liquidity liquidity is the ability to provide sufficient cash flow to meet financial commitments such as additional loan demand and withdrawals of existing deposits 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are its deposit base  fhlb borrowings  repayments and maturities on loans  short term assets such as federal funds and short term interest bearing deposits in banks  and maturities and sales of securities available for sale 
these sources are available in amounts sufficient to provide liquidity to meet the company s ongoing funding requirements 
the bank s membership in the fhlb of new york enhances liquidity in the form of overnight and day lines of credit of approximately million  which may be used to meet unforeseen liquidity demands 
there were overnight borrowings of  at a rate of being used at december  six separate fhlb term advances totaling million at december  were being used to fund securities leverage transactions 
in  cash generated from operating activities amounted to million and cash generated from financing activities amounted to million 
these amounts were offset by a use of cash in investing activities of million  resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million 
see the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional information 
maturity schedule of time deposits of  or more at december  deposits due three months or less  over three months through six months  over six months through twelve months  over twelve months  management anticipates much of these maturing deposits to rollover at maturity  and that liquidity will be adequate to meet funding requirements 
capital adequacy one of management s primary objectives is to maintain a strong capital position to merit the confidence of depositors  the investing public  bank regulators and shareholders 
a strong capital position should help the company withstand unforeseen adverse developments and take advantage of profitable investment opportunities when they arise 
stockholders equity increased million or in following an increase of in in  the board of directors authorized that million be made available to purchase shares on the open market 
during  no common shares were purchased 
during  a total of  common shares were purchased and retired which reduced stockholders equity by  management believes that the repurchase of company stock represents a prudent use of excess capital 
the company retained million from earnings  while other comprehensive income increased stockholders equity by million 
in accordance with regulatory capital rules  the adjustment for the after tax net unrealized gain or loss on securities available for sale is not considered in the computation of regulatory capital ratios 
under the federal reserve bank s risk based capital rules  the company s tier i risk based capital was and total risk based capital was of risk weighted assets 
these risk based capital ratios are well above the minimum regulatory requirements of for tier i capital and for total capital 
the company s leverage ratio tier i capital to average assets of is well above the minimum regulatory requirement

critical accounting policies pursuant to recent sec guidance  management of public companies are encouraged to evaluate and disclose those accounting policies that are judged to be critical policies  or those most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult subjective or complex judgments 
management of the company considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy given the inherent uncertainty in evaluating the levels of the allowance required to cover credit losses in the portfolio and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed adequate by management based on an evaluation of such factors as economic conditions in the company s market area  past loan loss experience  the financial condition of individual borrowers  and underlying collateral values based on independent appraisals 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and values of real estate particularly in sullivan county 
in the event that the casino gambling proposals do not progress  collateral underlying certain real estate loans could lose value which could lead to future additions to the allowance for loan loss in addition  federal regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses and my require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination  which may not be currently available to management

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk management of interest rate risk involves continual monitoring of the relative sensitivity of asset and liability portfolios to changes in rates due to maturities or repricing 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing of assets and liabilities through maturity and interest rate changes 
the objective of interest rate risk management to maintain an appropriate balance between income growth and the risks associated with maximizing income through the mismatch of the timing of interest rate is changes between assets and liabilities 
perfectly matching the repricing of assets and liabilities can eliminate interest rate risk  but net interest income is not always enhanced 
one measure of interest rate risk  the so called gap  is illustrated in the table below as of december  this table measures the incremental and cumulative gap  or difference between assets and liabilities subject to repricing during the periods indicated 
the dollar amounts presented are stated on the basis of contractual gap which measures the stated repricing and maturity of assets and liabilities 
the data presented indicates that rate sensitive liabilities are generally subject to repricing sooner than rate sensitive assets 
management retains the ability to change  or not change  interest rates on certain deposit products as general market rates change in the future  and is also in the position to liquidate a portion of its securities available for sale should conditions warrant such action 
the following is one of several different analysis tools management utilizes in managing interest rate risk 
to to to over maturity months months years years total loans  net      taxable securities      non taxable securities      total interest earning assets      now and super now accounts      savings and insured money market deposits      time deposits      long term debt     short term debt   total interest bearing liabilities      gap      cumulative gap     cumulative gap as a percentage of total interest earning assets based on contractual maturity or period to in repricing based on anticipated maturity 
includes securities available for sale and securities held to maturity  at their amortized cost 
fixed rate deposits and deposits with fixed pricing intervals are included in the period of contractual maturity 
deposits withdrawable on demand or within short notice periods such as now and savings accounts are shown in repricing periods based on management s estimate of the interest rate sensitivity of these accounts  based in part on the company s favorable historical experience of a substantial portion of these balances during periods of changing interest rates
