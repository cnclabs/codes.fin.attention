continuation of widespread casual dressing in the workplace could further reduce the demand for tailored clothing products  especially for tailored suits

deferred income taxes at november  aggregated million compared to million at november  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires  among other things  the recognition of deferred tax assets  including the future benefit associated with operating loss carryforwards  a periodic evaluation of the likelihood that the deferred tax assets are realizable and the establishment of a valuation allowance  in certain circumstances  to offset deferred tax assets to the extent realization is not considered more likely than not 
the company has concluded that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be fully realized and that a tax valuation reserve is not required

at november   the company had approximately million of federal tax operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income

dividends have not been paid since critical accounting policies the information provided below describing critical accounting policies is pursuant to securities and exchange commission financial reporting release no 
directing registrants to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
the company s significant accounting policies are contained in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
the financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and  accordingly  include amounts based on informed estimates and judgments of management with due consideration given to materiality 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following represents those critical accounting policies where materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 

receivables  net of allowances at november   accounts receivable  net of allowances  were million 
net receivables were determined based upon the company s evaluation of known requirements  aging of receivables  historical experience and the current economic environment 
amounts associated with potential return of products as well as customer chargebacks  net of expected recoveries  are reflected in net accounts receivable 
these types of allowances are reflected as a reduction of sales upon the determination that such allowances are reasonably estimatible and probable 
while the company believes it has appropriately considered known or expected outcomes  its customers ability to pay their obligations  including those to the company  could be adversely affected by declining sales of apparel at retail resulting from such factors as contraction in the economy or a general decline in consumer spending 

inventory valuation at november   inventories were million  and reflected the lifo valuation method as well as reductions from cost when required in order to state inventories at the lower of cost or market 
the lower of cost or market valuation considers the estimated realizable value in the current economic environment associated with disposing of surplus inventories 
additional downward valuation adjustments could be required should the current economic climate significantly worsen further resulting in retailers being unwilling to accept deliveries of advance orders placed or the company electing not to ship inventories to those retailers where additional credit risk is not deemed appropriate  or if a significant contraction were to occur in demand for the company s in stock replenishment business for selected product categories 
the potential additional downward valuation adjustments could result from unanticipated additional excess quantities of finished goods and raw materials  and or from lower disposition values offered by the parties who normally purchase surplus inventories 

deferred tax assets at november   the accompanying consolidated balance sheet reflects million of deferred tax assets  principally related to tax operating loss carryforwards 
as described in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company had approximately million of tax operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income 
in general  such carryforwards must be utilized within years of incurring the net operating loss within years with respect to the tax loss incurred in 
at november   the company concluded that it is more likely than not that there would be sufficient taxable earnings to fully utilize the operating loss carryforwards and no tax valuation allowance was required 
should the company experience a pre tax loss in fiscal resulting from further revenue declines and or the inability to improve operating margins  a tax valuation reserve may be required in whole or in part

 goodwill and other intangible assets  these intangibles were amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  generally ranging from five to ten years 
under fas  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are not being amortized  but instead are reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value 
accordingly  none of the goodwill associated with the acquisition of cag  aggregating million at november   has been amortized but has been subject to impairment testing during fiscal along with all other goodwill and intangible assets aggregating million 
this review indicated that no impairment adjustment was required 
the goodwill associated with cag increased million during fiscal based on the contingent consideration earned by the seller of the cag business pursuant to the purchase agreement  and may increase further based upon the achievement of specified levels of earnings before interest and taxes during five annual periods  as defined  beginning july   or upon a change in control 
should the operation of the cag business incur significant profitability and cash flow declines in future years  some or all of the recorded goodwill could be subject to impairment 
recent accounting pronouncements effective december   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
upon adoption  the company ceased amortizing goodwill relating to acquisitions prior to june   of which the net carrying amount was approximately million

impairment tests  which involve the use of estimates related to the fair market value of the business operations with which the goodwill is associated  are performed during the company s second quarter 
impairment charges  if any  resulting from impairment tests will be reflected in operating income in the income statement 
goodwill amortization in the years ended november  and was approximately

outlook during  the company made progress toward establishing itself as a diversified apparel company with a strengthened balance sheet  and sufficient liquidity and expected cash flows to support its business model that focuses on expected earnings improvements in and subsequent years 
the company generated a small pre tax profit during representing a significant improvement compared to the loss incurred in restructuring actions initiated in were completed in  which lowered both manufacturing and administrative costs through reduced production overheads  fewer warehousing and administrative facilities and headcount reductions 
additional administrative combinations initiated during are expected to be completed during and will reduce operating costs further upon completion 
the near term economic climate remains lackluster  being unfavorably impacted by generally weak consumer spending at retail 
reversing the company s declining revenue trends experienced over the past several years represents a principal operational objective for however  consumers near term concerns about the economy and possibility of a conflict in the middle east could adversely affect the company s in stock and future advance orders 
although the company s tailored clothing sales declined approximately in dollars during  there are indications that businesses are gradually moving away from everyday casual dress codes
