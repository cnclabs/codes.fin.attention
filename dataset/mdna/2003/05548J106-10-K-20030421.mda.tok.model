item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction bj s wholesale club  inc  which previously had been a wholly owned subsidiary of waban inc  became a separate and independent public entity on july   when waban distributed to its stockholders on a pro rata basis all of the company s outstanding common stock the spin off 
unless noted otherwise  the fiscal year ended february  is referred to as other fiscal years are referred to in a similar manner 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company reviews its estimates on an ongoing basis and makes judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities based on a number of factors 
these factors include historical experience  guidance provided by outside experts and assumptions made by management that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this section summarizes critical accounting policies and the related judgments involved in their application 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of merchandise when the customer takes delivery of and title to the merchandise  typically at the time of purchase in the club 
in the limited instances when the customer is not able to take delivery at the club  shipping terms are normally fob shipping point 
in all cases  revenue from the sale of merchandise is not recognized until title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
membership fee revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the membership  which is typically twelve months 
in determining comparable club information  the company includes all clubs that were open for at least months at the beginning of the period and were in operation during all of both periods being compared 
however  if a club is in the process of closing  it is excluded from comparable clubs 
the company includes relocated clubs and expansions in comparable clubs 
the company reports comparable club sales information on a same week basis whenever it is comparing sales between two fiscal years having weeks in one year and weeks in another 
sales for the weeks ended february  were compared with sales for the last weeks of the fiscal year ended february  to have a proper comparison for comparable sales reporting 
the company receives various types of cash consideration from vendors  principally in the form of rebates based on purchasing or selling certain volumes of product  time based rebates or allowances  which may include product placement allowances or exclusivity arrangements covering a predetermined period of time  price protection rebates and allowances for retail reductions on certain merchandise  and salvage allowances for product that is damaged  defective or becomes out of date 
the company recognizes such vendor rebates and allowances based on a systematic and rational allocation of the cash consideration offered to the underlying transaction that results in progress by the company toward earning the rebates and allowances  provided the amounts to be earned are probable and reasonably estimable 
otherwise  rebates and allowances are recognized only when predetermined milestones are met 
vendor rebates and allowances are typically realized as a reduction of cost of sales when the merchandise is sold or otherwise disposed of 
the company also receives cash consideration from vendors for demonstrating their products in the clubs or for advertising their products  particularly in the bj s journal  a publication sent to bj s members several times a year 
cash consideration for product demonstrations is recognized as a reduction of selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in the period during which the demonstrations are performed 
cash consideration for advertising vendors products is recognized as a reduction of sg a expenses in the period in which the advertising takes place 
in both cases  cash consideration represents a reimbursement of specific  incremental and identifiable sg a costs incurred by the company to sell the vendors products 
merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined under the average cost method  or market 
the company recognizes the write down of slow moving or obsolete inventory in cost of sales when such write downs are probable and estimable 
records are maintained at the stockkeeping unit sku level 
a report that details the number of weeks of selling supply for each sku allows the merchandising staff to make timely markdown decisions to help maintain rapid inventory turnover  which is essential in the company s business 
the carrying value of any sku whose selling price is marked down to below cost is immediately reduced to that selling price 
the company takes physical inventories of merchandise on a cycle basis at every location each year 
a second physical inventory is taken at the end of the year at selected locations 
the company estimates a reserve for inventory shrinkage for the period between physical inventories 
this estimate is based on historical results of previous physical inventories  shrinkage trends or other judgments management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the company reviews the realizability of its long lived assets annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
current and expected operating results and cash flows and other factors are considered in connection with the company s reviews 
for purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets  the recoverability test is performed using undiscounted net cash flows of individual clubs and consolidated net cash flows for long lived assets not identifiable to individual clubs 
significant judgments are made in projecting future cash flows and are based on a number of factors  including the maturity level of the club  historical experience of clubs with similar characteristics  recent trends and general economic assumptions 
the time period for newer clubs to become profitable varies  especially for clubs in a new market 
bj s does not consider newer clubs at risk for impairment of long lived assets until they meet planned dates for maturity 
impairment losses are measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the impaired assets 
as of february   the company had not established a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets because those assets can be realized by offsetting deferred tax liabilities and future taxable income  which management believes will more likely than not be earned  based on the company s historical record and projected earnings 
significant changes in projections of future taxable income could result in the company s establishment of a valuation allowance  which would reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets 
during the fiscal year ended february   the company established reserves for its liability related to househome  inc househome leases 
pursuant to an agreement with the tjx companies  inc tjx  bj s agreed to indemnify tjx for of househome s lease liabilities guaranteed by tjx through january  and for of any such liabilities thereafter 
househome filed for bankruptcy in november see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
bj s recorded liabilities were based on the present value of rent liabilities under the househome leases  including estimated real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges  reduced by estimated income from the subleasing of these properties 
an annual discount rate of was used to calculate the present value of these lease obligations 
this rate was based on estimated incremental borrowing rates for the company during the weighted average period of time over which these obligations are expected to be paid 
a considerable amount of judgment was involved in determining bj s net liability related to househome leases  particularly in estimating potential sublease income 
the company obtained an independent appraisal to help make this determination 
assumptions included an average period of time it would take to sublease the properties and the amount of potential sublease income for each property 
the company continually evaluates the adequacy of its househome reserves based on progress made in settling its obligations and the status of ongoing negotiations 
a significant number of househome leases were settled in and an adjustment to reduce the househome reserve was made in the third quarter of because the vast majority of the househome settlements to date have been made through lump sum settlements and because the company believes that most of the remaining leases will be settled in the same manner  the company is now basing the determination of its liability on estimated lump sum settlements instead of the previous assumption that the properties would be subleased 
the company may still satisfy its obligations by subleasing properties  which could change the timing of cash outflows 
during the fiscal year ended february   the company established reserves for its lease liabilities for three clubs which were closed in november two of these clubs were in the columbus  ohio  market and one was in north dade  florida 
see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
bj s recorded liabilities are based on the present value of rent liabilities under these leases  including estimated real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges  reduced by estimated income from the subleasing of these properties 
an annual discount rate of was used to calculate the present value of these lease obligations 
this rate was based on the estimated incremental borrowing rate for the company during the weighted average period of time over which these obligations are expected to be paid 
a considerable amount of judgment was involved in determining bj s net liability related to the closed club leases  particularly in estimating potential sublease income 
based on its knowledge of real estate conditions in the local markets and its experience in those markets  the company assumed an average period of time it would take to sublease the properties and the amount of potential sublease income for each property 
net payments that the company makes to settle its lease obligations will reduce operating cash flows in varying amounts over the remaining terms of the leases  which expire at various times up to instead of subleasing the properties  the company may satisfy its obligations through lump sum settlements  which could result in accelerated cash outflows 
the company is primarily self insured for worker s compensation and general liability claims 
reported reserves for these claims are derived from estimated ultimate costs based upon individual claim file reserves and estimates for incurred but not reported claims 
estimates are based on valuations provided by third party actuaries  historical loss development factors  and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the company is involved in various legal proceedings that are typical of a retail business 
along with outside legal counsel  the company assesses its exposure related to these proceedings and determines the amount of accruals required  if any  for these contingencies 
results of operations the following table presents income statement data for continuing operations for the last three fiscal years fiscal year ended february  february  february  weeks of net sales of net sales of net sales dollars in millions except per share amounts net sales membership fees and other total revenues cost of sales  including buying and occupancy costs selling  general and administrative expenses preopening expenses operating income interest income  net income loss on contingent lease obligations income from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes income from continuing operations diluted net income per common share number of clubs in operation at year end net sales increased by from to and by from to was a week fiscal year

total revenues included membership fees of million in  million in and million in the increases were due mainly to an increase in bj s membership fee from to  effective january   and to new members 
because members renew throughout the year and because membership fee income is realized over the life of the membership  the benefit of the fee increase was spread over and business members renewed at a rate of and inner circle members renewed at a rate of in both and the company entered the atlanta market with four new clubs in because atlanta was a market where bj s had no other clubs  very limited name recognition and two entrenched competitors  the company tested a program of free first year memberships during the preopening and initial opening periods of the new atlanta clubs in because of the initial free membership offer  the company believes that it attracted more members and generated more sales in these clubs in than would have been the case if new members had to pay a membership fee 
the company will generate incremental income from members who renew their membership for a fee in in this market 
sales are expected to decrease to a more normalized volume in than was experienced as a result of the initial free memberships offered the previous year in the atlanta market clubs 
cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs was of net sales in  in and in the increase in the cost of sales percentage from to was due to decreased merchandise gross margins and the increased sales contribution of gasoline  which together combined for approximately of the increase in the cost of sales ratio  and higher occupancy expenses  which accounted for most of the remainder of the increase 
gross margins on merchandise sales were lower in because of an unfavorable sales mix toward lower margin consumables and because of certain pricing initiatives begun in the fourth quarter to drive additional sales 
the gross margin rate on gasoline sales is significantly lower than the overall gross margin rate for the rest of bj s business 
occupancy expenses increased as a percentage of sales due to lower than planned comparable club sales increases and the opening of new clubs which generally start out with lower sales volumes than mature clubs in the last eighteen months 
the increase in the cost of sales percentage from to was attributable mainly to the increased sales contribution of gasoline  higher expenses for utilities and other occupancy costs  and initial excess capacity at the company s new cross dock facility in burlington  new jersey 
excluding gas  merchandise gross margin as a percentage of sales in rose slightly over the previous year 
selling  general and administrative expenses were of net sales in  in and in the increase in the sg a ratio in was due principally to increases in payroll  debit and credit card expenses and medical insurance  partially offset by lower incentive pay expenses and the increased contribution of gasoline sales  which have low related sg a costs 
the company also included million of asset impairment charges in sg a in the sg a ratio in general was unfavorably impacted by the effect of lower than planned comparable club sales increases on certain fixed expenses 
the decrease in the sg a ratio from to was due mainly to increased comparable club sales  lower payroll expenses as a percentage of sales and the increased contribution of gasoline sales 
total sg a expenses rose by million from to and by million from a week year to these increases were due mainly to an increase in the number of clubs in operation in both periods 
payroll and payroll benefits accounted for of all sg a expenses in  and in each of and payroll and payroll benefits accounted for of the increase in total sg a expenses from to and of the increase in total sg a expenses from to the amount of the increase from to contributed by payroll and related benefits was lower than usual  primarily because of lower incentive pay expenses in excluding the effect of expenses incurred in connection with the relocation of a cross dock facility in see next paragraph  payroll and related benefits accounted for of the increase in total sg a expenses from to in  the company recorded pretax charges of million associated with the relocation of its cross dock facility from bristol  pennsylvania  to burlington  new jersey

the decrease from to was attributable primarily to lower interest rates  which reduced income earned on invested cash 
see note l of notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the components of interest income and expense 
the company recorded a pretax charge of million in the third quarter of for its estimated loss associated with househome leases

this was partially offset by pretax accretion charges of million recorded in in connection with these obligations 
see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received by a vendor  eitf addresses how a reseller should account for cash consideration received from a vendor

that presumption is overcome when the consideration is a reimbursement of costs incurred by the customer to sell the vendor s products  in which case the cash consideration should be characterized as a reduction of that cost 
if the amount of cash consideration exceeds the cost being reimbursed  that excess amount should be characterized as a reduction of cost of sales 
beginning in fiscal  the company will classify any cash consideration in excess of expenses being reimbursed  should such an excess occur  as a reduction of cost of sales 
the second issue of eitf  which became effective for arrangements entered into after november   addresses the recognition and classification of cash consideration that is payable pursuant to a binding arrangement only if the customer completes a specified cumulative level of purchases or remains a customer for a specified period of time 
the adoption of this issue resulted in no change from the company s existing accounting 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared with million in and million in the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in versus was due principally to payments made to settle househome liabilities and a decrease in cash provided by the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in versus was due mainly to an increase in cash provided by the change in accounts payable 
accounts payable balances were higher than normal at the beginning of due in part to the january replenishment of inventories in categories with millennium related demand  much of which was paid for after the end of january cash provided by net income before depreciation and amortization and the net post tax loss on contingent lease obligations  store closing costs and asset impairment losses was million in versus million in and million in cash expended for property additions was million in versus million in in  the company opened thirteen new clubs and purchased one existing club  which was previously leased

the company expects to own approximately four of the new club locations opening in the company opened a new  square foot owned cross dock facility in jacksonville  florida  in april this facility will service the company s growing presence in the southeast 
in addition to the purchase of the new cross dock facility  the company expects to refurbish approximately clubs and increase capital spending for a number of technology initiatives 
the timing of actual club openings and the amount of related expenditures could vary from the estimates above due  among other things  to the complexity of the real estate development process 
during  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million of the company s common stock in addition to the million previously authorized 
in  the company repurchased  shares of common stock for million  or an average price of per share 
from the inception of its share repurchase activities in august  the company has repurchased a total of million of common stock at an average cost of per share 
as of february   the company s remaining repurchase authorization was million 
on june   the company entered into a new million unsecured credit agreement with a group of banks which expires june  the agreement includes a million sub facility for letters of credit  of which million was outstanding at february  the company is required to pay an annual facility fee which is currently of the total commitment 
interest on borrowings is payable at the company s option either at a the eurodollar rate plus a margin which is currently or b a rate equal to the higher of the sum of the federal funds effective rate plus or the agent bank s prime rate 
the company is also required to pay a usage fee in any calendar quarter during which the average daily amount of loans and undrawn or unreimbursed letters of credit outstanding exceeds of the total commitment 
the usage fee  if applicable  would currently be at an annual rate of of the average daily amount of credit used under the facility during the calendar quarter 
the facility fee  eurodollar margin and usage fee are subject to change based upon the company s fixed charge coverage ratio 
the agreement contains covenants which  among other things  include minimum net worth and fixed charge coverage requirements and a maximum funded debt to capital limitation 
the company is required to comply with these covenants on a quarterly basis 
under the credit agreement  the company may pay dividends or repurchase its own stock in any amount so long as the company remains in compliance with all other covenants 
bj s has no credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity date of debt if borrowings were outstanding under its credit agreement 
on august   the agreement was amended to change the minimum net worth requirement  thereby providing the company additional capacity to repurchase its common stock 
the company was in compliance with the covenants and other requirements set forth in its credit agreement at february  and for all fiscal periods throughout the year 
in addition to the credit agreement  the company maintains a separate million facility for letters of credit  primarily to support the purchase of inventories  of which million was outstanding at february   and also maintains a million uncommitted credit line for short term borrowings 
there were no bank borrowings outstanding at february  and february increases in inventories and accounts payable from february  to february  were due mainly to the addition of new clubs 
the average inventory per club at february  was higher than it was a year earlier  due in part to lower than planned inventory turns 
during the third quarter of  the company established reserves for its liability related to leases for three clubs which closed on november  see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
bj s recorded liabilities are based on the present value of rent liabilities under the three leases  including estimated real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges  reduced by estimated income from the subleasing of these properties 
an annual discount rate of was used to calculate the present value of these lease obligations 
this rate was based on estimated borrowing rates for the company that took into consideration the weighted average period of time over which these obligations are expected to be paid 
a considerable amount of judgment was involved in determining bj s net liability related to the closed club leases  particularly in estimating potential sublease income 
based on its knowledge of real estate conditions in the local markets and its experience in those markets  the company assumed an average period of time it would take to sublease the properties and the amount of potential sublease income for each property 
net payments that the company makes to settle its lease obligations will reduce operating cash flows in varying amounts over the remaining terms of the leases  which expire at various times up to instead of subleasing the properties  the company may satisfy its obligations through lump sum settlements  which could result in accelerated cash outflows 
as of february   the company has reserved a total of million associated with its liabilities for the closed club leases  million of which is included in other noncurrent liabilities  with the remainder included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the balance sheet 
the company believes payments it will make in connection with these leases will not have a material effect on its future financial condition or cash flows and that the liabilities recorded in the balance sheet adequately provide for its obligations 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s actual liability under the leases will not vary materially from amounts recorded in the financial statements due to a number of factors  including future economic factors which may affect the ability to successfully sublease or assign the properties 
the company considers its maximum reasonably possible undiscounted pretax exposure with respect to the leases for the three closed clubs to be approximately million at february  during the company made payments totaling million in connection with its indemnification obligations for househome leases 
the payments included lump sum settlements for leases 
four additional househome properties for which bj s remains contingently liable were assigned to third parties 
based on the company s continuing evaluation of its remaining obligations and the progress it has made in settling househome leases  the company reduced its estimated obligations by recording a million pretax gain in because the vast majority of househome settlements to date have been made through lump sum payments and because the company believes that most of the remaining leases will be settled in the same manner  the company has based the determination of its liability as of february  on estimated lump sum settlements instead of the previous assumption that the properties would be subleased 
an evaluation was made of each remaining property and some of the company s estimates were based on negotiations in progress 
although the terms of the remaining househome leases expire at various times up to  the company believes that it can settle its obligations on a more accelerated schedule than previously assumed  and this is reflected in the contractual cash obligations table shown below 
as of february   the present value of the company s obligations for the remaining househome leases totaled million  including million classified as current liabilities 
the company may still satisfy its obligations by subleasing properties  which could change the timing of cash outflows 
the company believes that remaining payments will not have a material impact on its future financial condition or cash flows and that the liabilities recorded in the financial statements adequately provide for its indemnification obligations 
however  there can be no assurance that bj s actual liability under the tjx indemnification agreement will not differ materially from amounts recorded in the financial statements due to a number of factors  including future economic factors which may affect the company s ability to successfully settle its househome obligations 
the company considers its maximum reasonably possible undiscounted pretax exposure for its househome lease obligations to be approximately million at february  the company has filed proofs of claim against househome  inc for claims arising under certain agreements between bj s and househome in connection with the company s spin off from waban inc in july these claims arise primarily from bj s indemnification of tjx with respect to tjx s guarantee of househome leases and from the tax sharing agreement dated july  between bj s and househome 
bj s has filed proofs of claim totaling approximately million 
bj s intends to amend its claims as it makes future payments for househome leases 
househome has indicated that it intends to contest at least a portion of bj s claims 
the company is unable to determine the amount  if any  of future recoveries under the claims and  therefore  has not recognized such claims in its financial statements 
in early december  the official committee of creditors of househome  inc filed an objection in the united states bankruptcy court  central district of california  santa ana division  to househome s motion to approve the disclosure statement in connection with its bankruptcy proceeding 
in that objection  the creditors committee stated that discussions are taking place between the committee and househome regarding the investigation of potential claims that may exist against certain entities related to househome  including bj s 
on april   househome filed its second amended plan of liquidation and a related disclosure statement 
in these documents  househome indicated that unless it was successful in settling bj s claims informally  it was likely to object to both bj s lease indemnification claims and bj s claims under the tax sharing agreement 
the following summarizes the company s contractual cash obligations as of february  and the effect these obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period total operating leases contingent lease obligations closed club lease obligations dollars in thousands february to january february to january february to january after january cash and cash equivalents totaled million as of february  and no borrowings were outstanding on that date
