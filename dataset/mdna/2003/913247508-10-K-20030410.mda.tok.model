the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations covers the years ended december   and and should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
these consolidated financial statements provide additional information regarding our financial activities and condition 
on january   united completed a transaction with liberty and ugc holdings  pursuant to which the following occurred 
immediately prior to the merger transaction on january  liberty contributed approximately million shares of ugc holdings class b common stock and approximately million shares of ugc holdings class a common stock to united and in exchange for these contributions  united issued liberty approximately million shares of its class c common stock  the founders transferred their shares of ugc holdings class b common stock to limited liability companies  which limited liability companies then merged into united 
as a result of such mergers  the founders received approximately million shares of united s class b common stock  which number of shares equals the number of shares of ugc holdings class b common stock transferred by them to the limited liability companies  and the principal founders contributed million to ugc holdings in exchange for securities that  at the effective time of the merger  converted into securities representing a interest in ugc holdings and entitled them to elect one half of ugc holdings directors 
as a result of the merger transaction ugc holdings became united s owned subsidiary and the principal founders held the remaining interest in ugc holdings  each share of ugc holdings class a and class b common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger was converted into one share of united s class a common stock  the shares of ugc holdings series b  c and d preferred stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger were converted into an aggregate of approximately million shares of united s class a common stock  which amount is equal to the number of shares of ugc holdings class a common stock the holders of ugc holdings preferred stock would have received had they converted their preferred stock immediately prior to the merger  liberty has the right to elect four of united s directors  the founders have the effective voting power to elect eight of united s directors  and united had the right to elect half of ugc holdings directors and the principal founders had the right to elect the other half of ugc holdings directors see discussion below regarding a transaction that occurred on may   pursuant to which ugc holdings became a wholly owned subsidiary of united and united became entitled to elect the entire board of directors of ugc holdings 
immediately following the merger transaction liberty contributed to united the upc exchangeable loan and  as a result  these dutch subsidiaries owe the amounts payable under such notes to united rather than to liberty  liberty contributed million in cash to united  liberty contributed to united the united upc bonds and  as a result  upc owes the amounts represented by the united upc bonds to united rather than to liberty  and in exchange for the contribution of these assets to united  an aggregate of approximately million shares of united s class c common stock was issued to liberty 
in december  idt united inc idt united commenced a cash tender offer for  and related consent solicitation with respect to  the entire billion face amount of senior discount notes of ugc holdings the ugc holdings notes 
as of the expiration of the tender offer on february   holders of the notes had validly tendered and not withdrawn notes representing approximately billion aggregate principal amount at maturity 
at the time of the tender offer  liberty had an equity and debt interest in idt united 
prior to the merger on january   united acquired from liberty million aggregate principal amount at maturity of the ugc holdings notes which had previously been distributed to liberty by idt united in redemption of a portion of liberty s equity interest and in prepayment of a portion of idt united s debt to liberty  as well as all of liberty s interest in idt united 
the purchase price for the ugc holdings notes and liberty s interest in idt united was united s assumption of approximately million of indebtedness owed by liberty to ugc holdings  and cash in the amount of approximately million 
on january   liberty loaned united approximately million  of which approximately million was used to purchase shares of redeemable preferred stock and convertible promissory notes issued by idt united 
following january   liberty loaned united an additional approximately million 
united used the proceeds of these loans to purchase additional shares of redeemable preferred stock and convertible promissory notes issued by idt united 
these notes to liberty accrue interest at annually  compounded and payable quarterly  and each note matures on its first anniversary 
although united only retains a common equity interest in idt united  united consolidates idt united as a special purpose entity  due to insufficient third party residual equity at risk 
on may   the principal founders transferred all of the shares of ugc holdings common stock held by them to united in exchange for an aggregate of  shares of united s class a common stock pursuant to an exchange agreement dated may   among such individuals and united 
this exchange agreement superseded the exchange agreement entered into at the time of the merger transaction 
as a result of this exchange  ugc holdings is now a wholly owned subsidiary of united  and united is entitled to elect the entire board of directors of ugc holdings 
this transaction was the final step in the recapitalization of ugc holdings 
we accounted for the merger transaction on january  as a reorganization of entities under common ownership at historical cost  similar to a pooling of interests 
under reorganization accounting  we have consolidated the financial position and results of operations of ugc holdings as if the merger transaction had been consummated at the inception of ugc holdings 
the purchase of the ugc holdings notes directly from liberty and the purchase of liberty s interest in idt united were recorded at fair value 
the issuance of united s new shares of class c common stock to liberty for cash  the united upc bonds and the upc exchangeable loan was recorded at the fair value of our common stock at closing 
the estimated fair value of these financial assets with the exception of the upc exchangeable loan was significantly less than the accreted value of such debt securities as reflected in ugc holdings historical financial statements 
accordingly  for consolidated financial reporting purposes  we recognized an extraordinary gain of approximately billion from the extinguishment of such debt outstanding at that time equal to the excess of the then accreted value of such debt over our cost  net of income tax  as follows fair value at acquisition book value gain loss in thousands ugc holdings notes    united upc bonds    upc exchangeable loan   write off of deferred financing costs   deferred income tax   total extraordinary gain on early extinguishment of debt  risks  uncertainties and liquidity our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern 
on a consolidated basis  we have continued to incur operating losses  negative cash flows from operations and substantial capital expenditures  which have been driven by our continued roll out of enhanced video services  voice services and high speed internet access services over our broadband network 
our major operating subsidiary  upc  has a net working capital deficiency as a result of recurring losses from operations and defaults under certain bank credit facilities  senior notes and senior discount note agreements 
upc has filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code and a moratorium of payments in the netherlands under dutch bankruptcy law 
in connection with these proceedings  upc has agreed on a reorganization plan with its major creditors  including us 
this plan of reorganization calls for a significant reduction in its current and long term debt and an increased ownership percentage by us 
our other operating subsidiary  vtr  is currently negotiating with several financial institutions to amend and refinance its bank credit facility that is due april  as part of this refinancing  vtr and we may be required to pay down amounts owed under the facility and capitalize certain shareholder loans to vtr  among other conditions 
we expect the term of vtr s bank credit facility to be extended for up to three years if this refinancing is successful 
with the successful completion of the planned restructuring of upc and refinancing of vtr s bank credit facility  we believe on a consolidated basis that we will have sufficient sources of capital  working capital and operating cash flows to enable us to continue as a going concern 
while we are optimistic that each of these transactions will be completed successfully  we cannot give assurance that these transactions will be completed on terms that are acceptable to us or our operating subsidiaries or at all 
accordingly  there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern 
our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should we not be able to continue as a going concern 
the broadband communications industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technology and the effect of technological changes on our businesses cannot be predicted 
our core offerings may become outdated due to technological breakthroughs rendering our products out of date 
in addition  our business plan contemplates the introduction of services using new technologies 
our investments in these new services may prove premature and we may not realize anticipated returns on these new products 
the cost of implementation for emerging and future technologies could be significant  and our ability to fund such implementation may depend on our ability to obtain additional financing 
we cannot be certain that we would be successful in obtaining any additional financing required 
a significant component of our strategy to increase our average revenue per unit is to successfully market broadband products to our existing residential client base 
we believe our triple play offering of video  telephone  and broadband access to the internet will continue to prove attractive to our existing customer base and allow us to increase our average revenue per unit 
we face significant competition in these markets  however  through terrestrial television  digital satellite and alternative internet access media  such as digital subscriber lines offered by incumbent broadband communications operators 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources than we do 
in order to compete effectively  we strive to provide  at a reasonable price to subscribers  new products and services  superior technical performance  superior customer service and a greater variety of video programming 
if we are unable to charge prices for broadband services that are anticipated in our business plan in response to competition or if our competition delivers a better product to our customers  our average revenue per unit and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
continued weak global economic conditions could adversely impact our revenues and growth rate 
continued softness in major markets  particularly in the broadband communications and consumer sectors  and customers uncertainty about the extent of the global economic downturn could result in lower demand for our products and services 
we have observed effects of the global economic downturn in many areas of our business 
the economic downturn has led  in part  to restructuring actions and contributed to write downs to reflect the impairment of certain investments in our investment portfolio 
despite the regulatory and economic factors discussed above  we believe that there is and will continue to be growth in the demand for broadband video  voice and internet access services in the residential and business marketplace 
matters pertaining to arthur andersen our former independent public accountants  arthur andersen  llp arthur andersen  were indicted by the united states department of justice on federal obstruction of justice charges in early  and ceased performing audits of public companies 
the opinion of arthur andersen included in this annual report on form k covers our financial statements as of and for the two years ended december  the opinion is a copy of the audit report previously issued by arthur andersen in connection with our annual report on form k for the year ended december   as amended in connection with amendment no 
to our form s registration statement filed on june  such report has not been reissued by arthur andersen 
at this time  the sec continues to accept financial statements audited by arthur andersen 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements required us to make estimates and assumptions that affected the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  which would potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of us and all our subsidiaries where we exercise a controlling financial interest through the ownership of a direct or indirect majority voting interest  including the accounts of upc  which on december   filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code with the us bankruptcy court  voluntarily commenced a moratorium of payments in the netherlands under dutch bankruptcy law and filed an akkoord with the dutch bankruptcy court under the dutch bankruptcy code 
although the us and dutch bankruptcy laws do convey significant rights to the bankruptcy courts  we believe during the bankruptcy proceedings that we substantively control upc for the following primary reasons as both the majority debt and equity holder  we had majority voting control before upc commenced involuntary bankruptcy proceedings and will have majority voting control of upc on its emergence from bankruptcy  as a result of our priority debt position and due to the fact we are upc s single largest creditor  we were able to negotiate the prearranged form of the voluntary bankruptcy filing by obtaining the agreement of the other key stakeholders upc third party bondholders and bank lenders that we would continue to be upc s controlling equity holder upon upc s emergence from bankruptcy  based on an evaluation of pre arranged debtor in possession bankruptcies filed in the us and in the netherlands  it was virtually certain from the filing of upc s bankruptcy petitions that the courts would confirm the bankruptcy plan  we believe the rights exercised by the us and dutch bankruptcy courts are protective in nature and  therefore  do not affect our continued substantive control over upc and the presumption that we should continue to consolidate upc during the bankruptcy process  and we believe that consolidating upc provides the best and most transparent financial reporting to our financial statement users 
accordingly  the accounts of upc have been consolidated for all periods presented in the accompanying financial statements 
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
cable network revenue and related costs we recognize revenue from the provision of video  residential telephony and internet access services over our cable network to customers in the period the related services are provided 
installation revenue including reconnect fees related to these services over our cable network is recognized as revenue in the period in which the installation occurs  to the extent these fees are equal to or less than direct selling costs  which are expensed 
to the extent installation revenue exceeds direct selling costs  the excess fees are deferred and amortized over the average expected subscriber life 
initial subscriber installation costs are capitalized and depreciated over the same period as the cable television network 
revenue and costs related to disconnections are recognized in the statement of operations as incurred 
other revenue and related costs we recognize revenue from the provision of dth  business telephony and data services to business customers outside of our cable network in the period the related services are provided 
installation revenue including reconnect fees related to these services outside of our cable network is deferred and amortized over the average expected subscriber life 
initial subscriber installation costs are capitalized and depreciated over the average expected subscriber life 
revenue and costs related to disconnections are recognized in the statement of operations as incurred 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets we test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis 
additionally  goodwill is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of an entity below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances may include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors 
other indefinite lived intangible assets are tested between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
for assets we intend to use  if the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we recognize a loss for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset 
for assets we intend to dispose of  we recognize a loss for the amount that the estimated fair value  less costs to sell  is less than the carrying value of the assets 
we principally use the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of long lived assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon our assessment of probable loss related to uncollectible accounts receivable 
generally  upon disconnection of a subscriber  the account is fully reserved 
the allowance is maintained until either receipt of payment or collection of the account is no longer pursued 
management uses a number of factors in determining the allowance  including  among other things  collection trends  prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and specific customer credit risk 
income taxes we evaluate our effective tax rates regularly and adjust rates when appropriate based on currently available information relative to statutory rates  apportionment factors and the applicable taxable income in the countries in which we operate  among other factors 
recovery of our deferred tax assets is dependent on the amount and timing of taxable income we will ultimately generate in the future  as well as other factors 
tax liabilities are recorded based on our assessment of the risk of loss involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities 
these potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
our estimate of tax liabilities also contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
liabilities subject to compromise we have recorded amounts for liabilities subject to compromise as prescribed by the american institute of certified public accountant s statement of position  financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code sop 
in accordance with sop  all of upc s pre petition liabilities that are subject to compromise under the proposed plan of reorganization are segregated in upc s consolidated balance sheet as liabilities subject to compromise 
these liabilities are recorded at the amounts expected to be allowed as claims in the bankruptcy proceedings rather than at the estimated amounts for which those allowed claims may be settled as a result of the approval of the plan of reorganization 
the estimates for allowable amounts are based on accounting records  discussions with creditors and amounts as documented in the reorganization plan  although these estimates for allowable amounts could change 
new accounting principles in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas 
under this new standard  among other things  most gains and losses from extinguishment of debt will not be classified as extraordinary items unless they meet much more narrow criteria in accounting principles board opinion no 
reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions apb 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after may   and must be adopted with retroactive effect 
we will adopt such standard on january   in accordance with the effective date and transition guidance provided for in sfas notwithstanding the reclassification of gains and losses from extinguishment of debt from extraordinary classification  we do not expect the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas requires the liability for a cost associated with an exit activity  including restructuring  or disposal activity to be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
sfas also requires subsequent adjustment to the recorded liability for changes in estimated cash flows and provides specific guidance on accounting for employee and contract terminations that are part of restructuring activities 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin 
fin clarifies and expands upon existing disclosure requirements for guarantees  including loan guarantees 
it also would require that  at the inception of a guarantee  we must recognize a liability for the fair value of our obligation under that guarantee 
the initial fair value recognition and measurement provisions will be applied on a prospective basis to certain guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of periods ending after december  we adopted the disclosure requirements and we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  the adoption of the recognition and measurement provisions of fin will have on our financial position and results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective immediately for variable interest entities created or acquired after january  it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february  we have adopted the transitional disclosure requirements and we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  the adoption of fin will have on our financial position and results of operations

these variations are due to fluctuations in the value of the common stock of our subsidiaries as well as changes in exchange rates 
stock based compensation is recorded as a result of applying variable plan accounting to certain of our subsidiaries stock based compensation plans and vesting of certain of our subsidiaries fixed stock based compensation plans 
the variable plans include the upc phantom stock option plan  the chello broadband phantom stock option plan  the ula phantom stock option plan and the vtr phantom stock option plan 
under variable plan accounting  increases in the fair market value of these vested options result in compensation charges to the statement of operations  while decreases in the fair market value of these vested options will cause a reversal of previous charges taken 
the fixed plans include the upc stock option plan and the austar united stock option plan 
adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is not a generally accepted accounting principle gaap measure 
adjusted ebitda represents net operating earnings losses before depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation charges and impairment and restructuring charges 
adjusted ebitda is the primary measure used by our chief operating decision makers to measure our operating results and to measure segment profitability and performance 
we believe that adjusted ebitda is meaningful to investors because it provides an analysis of operating results using the same measures used by our chief operating decision makers  that adjusted ebitda provides investors a means to evaluate our financial results compared to other companies within our industry and that it is common practice for institutional investors and investment bankers to use various multiples of current or projected adjusted ebitda for purposes of estimating current or prospective enterprise value 
our calculation of adjusted ebitda may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in our industry 
adjusted ebitda should not be viewed by investors as an alternative to gaap measures of income as a measure of performance or to cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  adjusted ebitda does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes that can affect cash flow 
adjusted ebitda excludes non cash and cash stock based compensation charges  which result from variable plan accounting for certain of our subsidiaries stock option and phantom stock option plans  and cash and non cash impairment and restructuring charges

depreciation and amortization year ended december  in thousands upc    vtr    austar united   other    total    depreciation and amortization expense decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior period  primarily due to the cessation of amortization of goodwill effective january   in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  from million for the year ended december  to  million for the year ended december   primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization resulting from acquisitions completed during as well as increased depreciation expense on capital expenditures to upgrade upc s network in western europe 
impairment and restructuring charges upc implemented a restructuring plan during the second half of to both lower operating expenses and strengthen its competitive and financial position 
this included eliminating certain employee positions  reducing office space and related overhead expenses  rationalization of certain corporate assets  recognizing losses related to excess capacity under certain contracts and canceling certain programming contracts 
the total workforce reduction was effected through attrition  involuntary terminations and reorganization of upc s operations to permanently eliminate open positions resulting from normal employee attrition 
the total cost of these charges was million for the year ended december  due to the lack of financial resources to fully develop the triple play in germany  and due to the inability of upc to find a partner to help implement this strategy  the long range plans of upc germany were revised in to provide for a care and maintenance program  meaning that the business plan would be primarily focused on current customers and product offerings instead of a planned roll out of new service offerings 
as a result of this revised business plan  upc determined that a triggering event had occurred with respect to this investment in the fourth quarter of  as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
after analyzing the projected undiscounted free cash flows without interest  an impairment charge was deemed necessary 
the amount of the charge was determined by evaluating the estimated fair value of upc s investment in upc germany using a discounted cash flow approach  resulting in an impairment charge of million for the year ended december  during the second quarter of  upc identified indicators of possible impairment of long lived assets  principally indefeasible rights of use irus and related goodwill within its clec subsidiary priority telecom 
such indicators included significant declines in the market value of publicly traded telecommunications providers and a change  subsequent to the acquisition of cignal  in the way that certain assets from the cignal acquisition were being used within priority telecom 
upc revised its strategic plans for using these assets because of reduced levels of private equity funding activity for clec businesses and a decision by upc to complete a public listing of priority telecom in the second half of the changes in strategic plans included a decision to phase out the legacy international wholesale voice operations of cignal 
when upc and priority telecom reached agreement to acquire cignal in the second quarter of  the companies originally intended to continue the international wholesale voice operations of cignal for the foreseeable future 
this original plan for the international wholesale voice operations was considered in the determination of the consideration paid for cignal 
in  using the strategic plan prepared in connection with the public listing of priority telecom  an impairment assessment test and measurement in accordance with sfas was completed  resulting in a write down of tangible assets  related goodwill and other impairment charges of million for the year ended december  in upc acquired a license to operate a wireless telecommunications system in switzerland 
since its acquisition  upc has been evaluating various alternatives to develop this license 
during the fourth quarter of  in connection with upc s overall strategic review  it was determined that upc was not in a position to develop this asset as a result of both funding constraints and a change in strategic focus away from the wireless business  resulting in a write down of the value of this asset to nil and a charge of million for the year ended december  as a result of issuing warrants to microsoft corporation during and  upc recorded million in contract acquisition rights 
these rights were being amortized over the three year term of an interim technology agreement 
during the fourth quarter of  this interim technology agreement was terminated  and the remaining unamortized contract acquisition rights totaling million were written off 
in december  austar united reviewed all of its activities and restructured its business to focus on the core pay television business and augment it with interactive television services 
this restructuring included outsourcing a number of existing functions  ceasing operation of its own internet network  streamlining sales and customer service processes and reducing general corporate overhead 
in conjunction with this restructuring  austar united analyzed the carrying value of its tangible and intangible assets in accordance with sfas  and determined there was an impairment in the value of certain of its assets  primarily the spectrum licenses and goodwill related to its internet business 
these assets were written down to fair value as of december  the impairment and restructuring charges for austar united totaled million  and due to the deconsolidation of austar united effective november   this amount was included in share in results of affiliates 
in addition  we recorded an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill on our books of million related to our investment in austar united 
based on our annual impairment test as of december  in accordance with sfas  we recorded an impairment charge of million and million on goodwill related to priority telecom and upc romania  respectively  for the year ended december  in addition  we wrote off obsolete inventory and other tangible assets in the netherlands  norway  france  poland  slovak republic and czech republic amounting to million for the year ended december  it is possible that upc may incur additional impairment and restructuring charges in such charges could arise as a result of its contemplated debt restructuring  a rationalization of its investments or the application of accounting standards used to value and adjust to the carrying value of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangibles

upc upc has incurred substantial operating losses and negative cash flows from operations  which have been driven by upc s continued rollout of broadband services such as digital video  voice and internet 
in addition  substantial capital expenditures have been required to deploy these services and to acquire businesses 
as a result  we expect upc to incur operating losses at least through upc s senior notes  senior discount notes  the upc exchangeable loan and the senior secured credit facility among upc distribution holding bv and upc financing partnership as borrowers and td bank europe limited and toronto dominion texas  inc  as facility agents  and a group of banks and financial institutions the upc distribution bank facility  are in default and have been classified as current liabilities 
upc s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on i its ability to restructure its senior notes and senior discount notes  the upc exchangeable loan and its convertible preferred stock and ii its ability to generate enough cash flow to enable it to recover the carrying value of its assets and satisfy its liabilities in the normal course of business 
given upc s funding requirements at the end of and possible lack of access to debt and equity capital in the near term  upc determined that it would not make interest payments on its senior notes as they fell due 
on february   upc failed to make required interest payments in the aggregate amount of million on its outstanding senior notes due  senior notes due and senior notes due the indentures related to its senior notes and senior discount notes provide that failing to make interest payments constitutes an event of default under the notes if upc is in default of the payment of interest on any of the notes for a period of time in excess of days 
since upc failed to make these interest payments upon expiration of this day grace period on march   events of default occurred under those indentures 
the occurrence of these events of default resulted in cross events of default under the indentures related to the remaining series of senior notes and senior discount notes 
the occurrence of the various events of default gave the trustees under the related indentures  or the requisite number of holders of such notes  the right to accelerate the maturity of all of upc s senior notes and senior discount notes 
in addition  on may   august   november  and february   upc failed to make required interest payments in the aggregate amount of million  million  million and million  respectively  on its outstanding senior notes due  senior notes due  senior notes due  senior notes due and senior notes due to date  upc has not made these payments  and neither the trustees for those notes nor the requisite number of holders of those notes have accelerated the payment of principal and interest under those notes 
upc s failure to make the february   may   august   november  and february  interest payments on certain of its outstanding senior notes gave rise to potential cross events of default under the upc distribution bank facility and the upc exchangeable loan 
the upc distribution bank facility is secured by share pledges on upc distribution which is the holding company of most companies within the upc distribution group  and over certain operating companies within this group 
the upc exchangeable loan is secured by pledges over the stock of belmarken  upc s wholly owned subsidiary  upc holding bv and upc internet holding bv  which owns chello broadband 
the occurrence of matured cross events of default under such facilities gave the creditors under those facilities the right to accelerate the maturity of the loans and to foreclose upon the collateral securing the loans 
on march   upc received the first of a series of waivers from the lenders of the upc distribution bank facility and the upc exchangeable loan for the potential cross events of default under such facilities that existed or may exist as a result of upc s failure to make the interest payments due on february  within the applicable cure periods  or any resulting cross defaults 
these waivers were periodically extended through september  on september  a waiver and amendment letter was executed with the upc distribution bank facility lenders that waived these events of default through march  the modified waiver letter 
the modified waiver letter includes amendments to the upc distribution bank facility to increase and extend the maximum permitted ratios of senior debt to annualized ebitda as defined in the bank facility and lower and extend the minimum required ratios of ebitda as defined in the bank facility to total cash interest and ebitda as defined in the bank facility to senior debt service  increase the interest margin on outstanding loans under the facility by  include a fee of on the total commitment amount  reduce the total commitment amount under the upc distribution bank facility to billion  and require upc to inject million in cash to upc distribution on or before march  on september   we  upc and the bondholder committee executed a reorganization plan 
if completed under its current terms  the reorganization plan will substantially delever upc s consolidated balance sheet through the judicially supervised conversion of the upc exchangeable loan and upc s senior notes and senior discount notes into new common stock issued by new upc 
key terms of the reorganization plan are as follows we will receive approximately of new upc s pro forma equity subject to dilution under certain circumstances in exchange for the united upc bonds and the upc exchangeable loan  third party noteholders will receive approximately of new upc s pro forma equity subject to dilution under certain circumstances in exchange for their holdings  upc s existing preferred and ordinary shareholders  including us  will receive approximately of new upc s pro forma equity subject to dilution under certain circumstances  an agreement by the parties other than upc to forbear on exercising rights and remedies relating to defaults on the senior notes  senior discount notes and the upc exchangeable loan while the restructuring remains in effect  and we will purchase up to million of new upc common stock or assets as part of upc s restructuring subject to reduction if upc sells any assets  raises any non dilutive capital prior to the closing of the restructuring or if the third party bondholders participate pro rata in the equity issuance 
in order to effect the restructuring  on december   upc filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code  including the pre negotiated reorganization plan 
in conjunction with the commencement of the us chapter case  upc commenced a moratorium of payments in the netherlands under dutch bankruptcy law and filed an akkoord with the dutch bankruptcy court 
upc submitted a revision to the reorganization plan in the us bankruptcy court and to the akkoord in the dutch bankruptcy court on december   and a subsequent revision on january  the us bankruptcy court confirmed the reorganization plan on february  the dutch bankruptcy court ratified the akkoord on march  on march   ich  a creditor in the dutch moratorium proceeding with a claim and one vote  appealed the dutch bankruptcy court s ratification of the akkoord 
the dutch court of appeals held a hearing on the appeal on april   and is expected to rule on the appeal on or about april  upc believes the appeal is without merit 
the us bankruptcy court has already overruled an objection brought by ich in the parallel us chapter case 
upc does not expect that this appeal will affect the successful completion of upc s restructuring  which is in its final stages 
the appeal will  however  delay completion of the restructuring into the second quarter of any ruling by the dutch court of appeals is subject to final appeal with the dutch supreme court cassatie within days after the ruling of the dutch court of appeals 
effective april   the upc distribution bank facility lenders have extended until september   the waivers of the defaults arising as a result of upc s decision not to make interest payments under its outstanding senior notes  as described above the amended waiver letter 
the amended waiver letter amends the relevant period as defined in the modified waiver letter to include that in the event of an appeal of the decision of the dutch bankruptcy court on march  ratifying the akkoord  the relevant period is the date falling business days after a judgment by either a dutch court  a dutch court of appeal or the dutch supreme court together  the dutch courts in relation to such appeal is rendered and has become final and conclusive 
in addition  the definition of termination event as defined in the modified waiver letter is amended to include if at any time prior to the end of the relevant period any of the dutch courts renders a judgment that has become final and conclusive that annuls or otherwise reverses or overturns the ratification of the dutch bankruptcy court of march  or that otherwise has the effect that the akkoord is no longer effective or cannot be implemented 
except as noted above  the material terms of the amended waiver letter are unchanged from those in the modified waiver letter 
as a condition to obtaining the amended waiver letter  upc completed the contribution of million in cash to upc distribution on april   as contemplated in the modified waiver letter 
the reorganization plan and the akkoord and other transactions contemplated by the restructuring agreement are to become effective on a date the effective date identified by upc and falling no more than eleven days after all conditions to the consummation of the reorganization plan and akkord have been satisfied or waived 
unlike the us bankruptcy code  the dutch bankruptcy code does not provide for the akkoord to reorganize or cancel any of the equity interests  ownership interests or shares in upc 
therefore  in accordance with dutch law and in order to facilitate implementation of the reorganization plan  new upc commenced an offer  solely with respect to holders of upc ordinary shares a who were not us persons and were not located or residing within the united states  to deliver shares of new upc common stock to such holders the dutch implementing offer 
similarly  the dutch bankruptcy code does not provide for the dutch bankruptcy case to exempt compliance from otherwise applicable corporate law 
therefore  in order to facilitate implementation of the reorganization plan  upc held a shareholders meeting on february   to approve certain amendments to upc s articles of incorporation and certain other shareholder proposals 
all of the amendments and other proposals were approved 
no further us or dutch shareholder action is required to complete the restructuring 
upc believes subscriber growth has been impacted in some countries by upc s financial restructuring  however upc believes the restructuring has not had a material adverse effect on its subsidiaries or upc s relationship with suppliers and employees 
upon completion of the restructuring  upc expects that its remaining consolidated cash balances  together with anticipated cash flow from operations  will provide it with sufficient capital to fund its existing operations for the foreseeable future 
however  if upc wishes to expand its cable television services or broadband communications network to take full advantage of business opportunities  it will require additional capital 
due to upc s recent financial performance  it may not be able to maintain adequate sources of capital to finance its capital expenditures 
upc does not know when additional financing may be available to it if at all or available on favorable terms 
a failure to acquire additional capital on acceptable terms may seriously and adversely affect the growth of its business and may have an adverse effect on the valuation of its tangible and intangible assets

if this refinancing is successful  the term of the vtr bank facility is expected to be extended for up to three years 
although we believe we will be successful in refinancing the vtr bank facility prior to its due date of april   there can be no assurance that it will occur on terms that are satisfactory to vtr or us or at all

derivative instruments we use derivative financial instruments from time to time to manage exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas  which establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheets as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
these rules require that changes in the derivative instrument s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative instrument s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the statement of operations  to the extent effective  and requires that a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
for derivative financial instruments designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges  changes in the fair value of the effective portion of the derivative financial instruments are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative financial instruments is immediately recognized in earnings 
the change in fair value of the hedged item is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying value on the balance sheet 
for derivative financial instruments that are not designated or that do not qualify as accounting hedges  the changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments are recognized in earnings 
the following table provides detail of the fair value of derivative instruments we have december  in thousands upc july senior notes cross currency interest rate derivative contract upc october senior notes cross currency interest rate derivative contract  upc january senior notes cross currency interest rate derivative contract  upc distribution bank facility cross currency interest rate derivative contract   other  total derivative liabilities assets  net   concurrent with the closing of the upc july senior notes offering  upc entered into a cross currency swap  swapping the million upc dollar senior notes due into fixed and variable rate euro notes with a notional amount totaling million

for the years ended december  and  we recorded losses of million and million  respectively  in connection with the change in fair value of these derivative instruments

in addition  upc entered into an interest rate swap of billion to fix the euro interbank offer rate euribor portion of the interest calculation to for the period ending april  this billion interest rate swap on the upc distribution bank facility qualifies as an accounting cash flow hedge as defined by sfas accordingly  the changes in fair value of this instrument are recorded through other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated statement of stockholders equity deficit 
inflation and foreign investment risk certain of our operating companies operate in countries where the rate of inflation is extremely high relative to that in the united states 
while our affiliated companies attempt to increase their subscription rates to offset increases in operating costs  there is no assurance that they will be able to do so 
therefore  operating costs may rise faster than associated revenue  resulting in a material negative impact on reported earnings 
we are also impacted by inflationary increases in salaries  wages  benefits and other administrative costs  the effects of which to date have not been material 
our foreign operating companies are all directly affected by their respective countries government  economic  fiscal and monetary policies and other political factors 
we believe that our operating companies financial conditions and results of operations have not been materially adversely affected by these factors
