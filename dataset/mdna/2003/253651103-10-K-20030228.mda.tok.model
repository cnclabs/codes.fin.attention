the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
as of january  was not material to the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents since a substantial portion of the company s operations and revenue arise outside of the united states  financial results can be significantly affected by changes in foreign exchange rate movements 
the company s financial risk management strategy uses forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures 
such contracts are designated at inception to the related foreign currency exposures being hedged 
the company s intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures  with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging these exposures 
the company does not enter into any speculative positions with regard to derivative instruments 
the company s forward contracts generally mature within six months 
the company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value

significant accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
management of the company uses historical information and all available information to make these estimates and assumptions 
actual amounts could differ from these estimates and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes that of its significant accounting policies  its policies concerning trade receivables and revenue recognition  inventories  goodwill  and pensions and postretirement benefits are the most critical 
additional information regarding these policies is included below 
trade receivables and revenue recognition revenue is recognized based on the terms of the sales contract 
the majority of sales contracts for products are written with selling terms fob factory 
however  certain sales contracts may have other terms such as fob destination or upon installation 
the company recognizes revenue on these contracts when the appropriate event has occurred 
service revenue is recognized in the period service is performed and subject to the individual terms of the service contract 
the concentration of credit risk in the company s trade receivables with respect to the banking and financial services industries is substantially mitigated by the company s credit evaluation process  reasonably short collection terms and the geographical dispersion of sales transactions from a large number of individual customers 
the company maintains allowances for potential credit losses  and such losses have been minimal and within management s expectations 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on various factors including revenue  historical credit losses and current trends 
inventories domestic inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market applied on a first in  first out basis  and foreign inventories are valued using the average cost method 
as the company launches new products and rationalizes its product offerings  inventory related to discontinued product is written down to salvage value 
goodwill goodwill is the cost in excess of the net assets of acquired businesses 
these assets are stated at cost and  effective january   are no longer amortized  but evaluated at least annually for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets in that goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized but rather will be tested at least annually for impairment 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 

table of contents the company tests all existing goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis 
the reporting units were determined on a geographical basis that combine two or more component level reporting units with similar economic characteristics within a single reporting unit 
a fair value approach is used to test goodwill for impairment 
an impairment charge is recognized for the amount  if any  by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
fair values of reporting units and the related implied fair values of their respective goodwill were established using discounted cash flows 
when available and as appropriate  comparative market multiples were used to corroborate results of the discounted cash flows 
pensions and postretirement benefits the company has several pension plans covering substantially all united states employees 
plans covering salaried employees provide pension benefits that are based on the employee s compensation during the years before retirement 
the company s funding policy for those plans is to contribute annually at an actuarially determined rate 
plans covering hourly employees and union members generally provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service 
the company s funding policy for those plans is to make at least the minimum annual contributions required by applicable regulations 
employees of the company s operations in countries outside of the united states participate to varying degrees in local pension plans  which in the aggregate are not significant 
minimum liabilities are recorded for plans where the total accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of the plan s assets 
in addition to providing pension benefits  the company provides healthcare and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees 
eligible employees may be entitled to these benefits based upon years of service with the company  age at retirement and collective bargaining agreements 
currently there are no plan assets and the company funds the benefits as the claims are paid 
the postretirement benefit obligation was determined by application of the terms of medical and life insurance plans together with relevant actuarial assumptions and healthcare cost trend rates 
for  medical cost trend rates were projected at percent and prescription drug cost trend rates were projected at percent  with both cost trend rate assumptions gradually declining to percent by and remaining at that level thereafter 
annually  the company analyzes its key assumptions related to its pension plans 
key assumptions include the long term rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate and the compensation levels 
such factors as financial market performance and actual compensation levels are considered when analyzing the key assumptions 
business drivers and risks the business drivers to the company s future performance include several factors which include  but are not limited to timing of a self service upgrade and or replacement cycle in mature markets such as the united states  high levels of deployment growth for new self service products in emerging markets such as asia pacific  demand for new service offerings including outsourcing or operating a network of atms  demand beyond expectations for security products and services for the financial  retail and government sectors  and implementation and timeline for new electronic voting solutions in the united states 
however  in addition to the business drivers above  as a global operation  the company is exposed to the following risks which include but are not limited to competitive pressures  including pricing pressures and technological developments  changes in the company s relationships with customers  suppliers  distributors and or partners in its business ventures  changes in political  economic or other factors such as currency exchange rates  inflation rates  recessionary or expansive trends  taxes and regulations and laws affecting the worldwide business in each of the company s operations  including brazil  acceptance of the company s product and technology introductions in the marketplace  unanticipated litigation  claims or assessments  ability to reduce costs and expenses and improve internal operating efficiencies  and variation in consumer demand for self service technologies  products and services

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our international operations denominated in currencies other than the us dollar

the assumption that exchange rates change in an instantaneous or parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on amounts denominated in a foreign currency 
the company s risk management strategy uses derivative financial instruments such as forwards to hedge certain foreign currency exposures 
the intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures  with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging these exposures 
the company does not enter into derivatives for trading purposes
