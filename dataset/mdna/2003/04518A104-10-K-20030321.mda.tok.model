item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we are a leading provider of telecommunications network integration services and software solutions in china 
our software products and network services enable our customers to build  maintain  operate  manage and continuously improve their communications infrastructure 
we commenced our operations in the united states in and moved our operations from the united states to china in we began generating significant network solutions revenues in and significant software solutions revenues in we conduct the bulk of our business through our wholly owned operating subsidiaries  asiainfo technologies china  inc  or asiainfo technologies  and asiainfo management software  inc  or asiainfo management  which are both chinese companies 
we develop  market and sell our products and services through our two strategic business units communications solutions and operation support system solutions 
communications solutions offers network infrastructure solutions  service application solutions  network security solutions and network monitoring solutions 
we had previously offered network security solutions through a majority owned subsidiary  marsec holdings inc  or marsec  but have integrated marsec s network security business into our communications solutions business unit 
we acquired the outstanding minority shares of marsec in january operation support system solutions offers customer care and billing  customer relationship management and similar software solutions for telecommunications providers 
on february   we completed our acquisition of bonson information technology holdings limited  or bonson  a leading provider of operation support system solutions to wireless telecommunications carriers in china 
the consideration paid to the former shareholders of bonson consisted of million net of acquisition costs in cash and  shares of our common stock which were valued at approximately million at the time the acquisition was announced 
the cash we paid in connection with the acquisition was paid out of our existing cash reserves 
bonson s operating results have been consolidated with our operating results from february  we believe that there are opportunities for us to expand into new business areas and to grow our business both organically and through acquisitions 
in view of the bonson acquisition and potential future acquisitions we may engage in  our historical operating results may not be an adequate basis on which to evaluate our prospects 
as a result of the recent restructuring in china s telecommunications industry  new orders for telecommunications infrastructure expansion and improvement projects have decreased over the past several quarters  adversely affecting our net revenue and profitability 
according to the mii  overall capital expenditure by telecommunications services decreased by to billion in although we expect that the restructuring will have a positive impact on growth in the telecommunications industry in china in the long term and that spending will begin to return to pre restructuring levels in the second half of  continued delays in capital expenditure projects could continue to negatively affect our growth in the near term 
similar restructurings of this nature could cause our operating results to vary unexpectedly from quarter to quarter in the future 
revenues we reorganized our operating units in the fourth quarter of in order to more accurately reflect our strategic focus 
our operations are now organized into two strategic business units communications solutions and operation support system solutions 
communications solutions include the following business lines network solutions  service application solutions  network security solutions and network monitoring solutions 
operation support system solutions  or oss  includes our highly scalable customer care and billing software capable of automating a telecom carrier s key business processes  such as billing and order management 
our results of operations were previously reported under the segments network solutions and software solutions 
although we report our revenues on a gross basis  inclusive of hardware acquisition costs that are passed through to our customers  we manage our business internally based on revenues net of hardware costs  which is consistent with our strategy of providing our customers with high value it professional services and  where efficient  outsourcing lower end services such as hardware acquisition and installation 
this strategy may result in lower growth rates for total revenues as against prior periods  but will not adversely impact revenues net of hardware costs 
the following table shows our revenue breakdown on this basis both under our new and old reporting segments year ended december  new reporting segments communications solutions net of hardware costs n a n a n a operation support system solutions net of hardware costs n a n a n a old reporting segments network solutions net of hardware costs software solutions reclassified to conform with presentation 
prior to the restructuring of our operating units in the fourth quarter of  we reported our operating results on the basis of our old reporting segments network solutions and software solutions 
although we have reclassified our revenues for the year according to our new reporting segments  reclassifying our revenues for  and would be not be reasonably practicable 
most of the projects we undertake for our customers  both in the communications solutions business unit and the oss solutions business unit include revenue from hardware  software and professional services 
hardware revenue 
we generate significant revenue through hardware sales for equipment procured by us on behalf of our customers from hardware vendors 
we procure for and sell hardware to our customers as part of our total solutions strategy 
we minimize our exposure to hardware risks by sourcing equipment from hardware vendors against letters of credit from our customers 
we believe that as the telecommunications related market in china develops our customers will increasingly purchase hardware directly from hardware vendors and hire us for our professional services and software solutions 
software license revenue 
we generate revenue in the form of fees received from customers for licenses to use our software products in perpetuity  typically up to a specified maximum number of users 
in most cases  our customers must purchase additional user licenses from us when the number of users exceeds the specified maximum 
we also include in revenue the benefit of value added tax rebates on software license sales  which are part of the chinese government s policy of encouraging china s software industry 
services revenue 
services revenue consists of revenue for the professional services we provide to our customers for network planning  design and systems integration  software customization and installation  and related training services 
we generally charge a fixed price for all of our projects and recognize revenue based on the percentage of completion of the project 
revenues in both communications solutions and operation support system solutions from customer orders requiring significant production  modifications  or customization of the software are recognized over the installation and customization period 
we use labor costs and direct project expenses to determine the stage of completion  except for revenue associated with the procurement of hardware on behalf of the customer 
we recognize such hardware related revenues upon delivery 
since a large part of the cost of certain projects  particularly network solutions  often relates to hardware  the timing of hardware delivery can cause our quarterly gross revenue to fluctuate significantly 
however  these fluctuations do not significantly affect our gross profit because hardware related revenues generally approximate the costs of the hardware 
our projects generally have a life of nine to twelve months  during which there are three key milestones 
the first milestone occurs when the hardware is delivered  which is usually between three and four months after signing the contract 
the second milestone in a project is at primary acceptance  which usually occurs around three to four months after hardware delivery 
at primary acceptance  most of the services and products are delivered 
the third milestone is final acceptance  which occurs when the customer agrees that we have satisfactorily completed all of our work on the project 
unbilled revenue 
our revenue recognition policies result in our recognizing certain revenues even though we are not due to receive the corresponding cash payment under the relevant contract 
in the case of hardware sales  the customer typically holds back around to of the hardware contract payments at the time of delivery until final project acceptance 
although we record all hardware revenue at the time of delivery  the to held back by the customer is recorded as unbilled receivables and does not become billable until final project acceptance 
in the case of services and software license revenues  most of the revenue becomes billable at the time of primary acceptance  but the customer typically holds back around to of the services and software contract payments until final acceptance 
unpaid amounts for services and software  as well as for hardware  become payable at the time of final project acceptance 
when we recognize revenue for which payments are not yet due  we book unbilled accounts receivable until the corresponding amounts become billable 
revenue backlog 
most of our revenues are derived from customers orders under contracts for hardware  software and services 
our backlog at any given time includes the contracts we have signed but have not yet commenced and the portion of uncompleted contracts for which revenue has not yet been recognized 
revenues are recognized during the course of the relevant project  as described above 
at december   our revenue backlog net of hardware costs was million  an decrease compared to backlog one year ago 
the decrease in total net revenue backlog was primarily due to the prolonged delays in the restructuring of certain state controlled telecommunications companies in china  including china telecom  causing the carriers to delay their orders longer than previously expected 
oss solutions backlog was million  or of net revenue backlog  a increase over the period a year ago 
orders under contracts generated by bonson accounted for of the total backlog net of hardware costs and of oss solutions backlog 
we believe that these changes illustrate our successful transition from a pure systems integration company to a provider of total software solutions to china s telecommunications service providers 
cost of revenues costs of revenues in both the communications solutions business unit and the oss solutions business unit include hardware costs  software related costs and compensation and travel expenses for the professionals involved in the relevant projects 
hardware costs consist primarily of third party hardware costs and related warranty costs 
we recognize hardware costs in full upon delivery of the hardware to our customers 
in order to minimize our working capital requirements  we generally obtain from our hardware vendors payment terms that are timed to permit us to receive payment from our customers for the hardware before our payments to hardware vendors are due 
however  in large projects we sometimes obtain less favorable payment terms from our customers  thereby increasing our working capital requirements 
we accrue hardware warranty costs when hardware revenue is fully recognized upon final acceptance 
we obtain manufacturers warranties for hardware we sell  which cover a portion of the warranties that we give to our customers 
we currently accrue of hardware sales to cover potential warranty expenses 
this estimate of warranty cost is based on our current experience with contracts for which the warranty period has expired 
software related costs consist primarily of packaging and written manual expenses for our proprietary software products and software license fees paid to third party software providers for the right to sublicense their products to our customers as part of our solutions offerings 
we do not accrue any software warranty costs for our proprietary software and accrue of sales of third party software as warranty costs when such revenue is recognized upon final acceptance 
the costs associated with creating and enhancing our proprietary software are classified as research and development expenses as incurred 
operating expenses operating expenses are comprised of sales and marketing expenses  research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses  and amortization expenses for intangible assets and deferred stock compensation 
sales and marketing expenses include compensation expenses for employees in our sales and marketing departments  third party advertising expenses  as well as sales commissions and sales agency fees 
research and development expenses relate almost entirely to the development of new software and the enhancement and upgrading of existing software 
we expense these costs as they are incurred 
overall operating expenses include significant compensation expenses 
in the third quarter of  in an effort to scale our business to accommodate lower market demand  we reduced these costs through a headcount reduction and a salary cut for employees at the manager level and above 
we provide most of our officers  employees and directors  with stock options 
in the past  we granted a number of options with exercise prices below the fair market value of the related shares at the time of grant  resulting in deferred compensation expenses 
most of the options granted with exercise prices below fair market value on the date of grant were issued prior to and we do not intend to issue options below fair market value in the future 
therefore  our deferred compensation expenses have been significantly higher historically than we expect them to be in future years 
the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the related shares is amortized over the vesting period of the options and reflected on our consolidated statement of operations as amortization of deferred stock compensation 
for more information on our deferred compensation expenses  please see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we make bad debt provisions for accounts receivable balances based on management s assessment of their recoverability 
in any event  we make bad debt provisions for all accounts receivable balances that are aged over one year 
we include those bad debt provisions in general and administrative expenses 
taxes except for certain of our hardware procurement and resale transactions  we conduct substantially all of our business through our chinese operating subsidiaries 
our chinese subsidiaries are generally subject to a state corporate income tax and a local income tax 
pursuant to the income tax laws of china  foreign invested enterprises meeting certain criteria set out by the relevant tax authorities can enjoy various preferential tax treatments 
asiainfo technologies  our principal operating subsidiary for our communications solutions sbu  is registered and operates in the beijing zhongguancun science park and is classified as a new technology enterprise 
the effective income tax rate for new technology enterprises registered and operating in beijing zhongguancun science park is 
new technology enterprises  including asiainfo technologies  are also exempt from chinese state and local corporate income tax for three years  beginning with their first year of operations  and are entitled to a tax reduction at the rate of for the subsequent three years 
the tax exemption for asiainfo technologies expired on december  and the tax reduction expired on december  however  asiainfo technologies received a continuation of its preferential tax treatment from the local tax authorities in china for an additional three years  expiring at the end of  which reduces our effective income tax rate to 
asiainfo management is registered and operates in the high and new technology industry development zone in guangzhou  and is classified as a high and new technology enterprise 
the effective income tax rate  subject to the approval of the relevant tax authorities  for high and new technology enterprises registered in high and new technology industry development zones is 
high and new technology enterprises  including asiainfo management are also exempt from chinese state and local corporate income tax for two years  beginning with their first profitable year of operations  and are entitled to a tax reduction at the rate of for the subsequent three years 
the tax exemption for asiainfo management expired on december  and the tax reduction will expire on december  asiainfo technologies chengdu  inc  or asiainfo chengdu  our subsidiary that sources hardware in china for our customers  is registered in the high and new technology industry development zone in chengdu and is classified as a high and new technology enterprise 
subject to anticipated formal governmental approval  it is likely that asiainfo chengdu will operate free of chinese state and local corporate income tax for two years beginning from its first profitable year of operation  which was  and should be entitled to a tax reduction at the rate of for the subsequent three years 
as such  the anticipated tax holiday for asiainfo chengdu should expire on december  and the tax reduction should expire on december  sales of hardware procured in china are subject to a value added tax 
most of our sales of hardware procured outside china are made through our hong kong subsidiary  asiainfo hk limited  or asiainfo hk  and thus are not subject to the value added tax 
we effectively pass value added taxes on hardware sales through to our customers and do not include them in revenues reported in our financial statements 
although sales of software in china are subject to a value added tax  companies that develop their own proprietary software are generally entitled to a value added tax refund 
if the net amount of the value added tax payable exceeds of software sales  the excess portion of the value added tax is refundable immediately 
this policy is effective until changes in chinese tax laws may adversely affect our future operations 
we are also subject to us income taxes on revenues generated in the united states  including revenues from our limited hardware procurement activities through our us parent company  asiainfo holdings  inc  and interest income earned in the united states 
foreign exchange a majority of our revenues and expenses relating to hardware sales are denominated in us dollars  and substantially all of our revenues and expenses relating to the software and service components of our business are denominated in renminbi 
although  in general  our exposure to foreign exchange risks should be limited  the value of our shares will be affected by the foreign exchange rate between us dollars and renminbi because the value of our business is effectively denominated in renminbi  while our shares are traded in us dollars 
furthermore  a decline in the value of renminbi could reduce the us dollar equivalent of the value of the earnings from  and our investment in  our subsidiaries in china 
consolidated results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues  including hardware pass through  decreased to million in  from million in revenues net of hardware costs decreased approximately to million in oss solutions revenue was million in  representing of total revenues net of hardware costs and a increase over oss solutions revenue of million in this increase was primarily due to our acquisition of bonson  which has been consolidated since february  and contributed million to oss solutions revenue in communications solutions revenue was million in  compared to million in  representing a decrease of 
this decrease was partially attributable to our shift in focus to high end systems integration projects involving less hardware pass through revenue 
under our previous reporting structure  software solutions revenues were million in  representing of total revenues net of hardware costs and a increase over software solutions revenues from the previous year 
network solutions revenues net of hardware costs were million in  a decrease from the previous year 
the decrease in total revenues are primarily attributable to a shift in our customer s focus from increasing network capacity to increasing network productivity through the provision of more advanced applications  as well as our shift in focus to high end systems integration projects involving less hardware pass through revenue 
the decrease in net revenues was attributable to the prolonged telecommunications industry restructuring in china resulting in an estimated decrease of total capital expenditure in on the part of telecommunications carriers in china 
the decrease in net revenues was partially offset by our acquisition of bonson  which contributed of total net revenue and approximately of net revenue in our oss solutions business unit 
for more information on the restructuring  please see the discussion above under the heading item business industry background 
looking forward  we anticipate that our net revenues will increase to in we expect oss solutions revenue to account for to of total net revenues in cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues decreased to million in  partially as a result of more customers purchasing hardware directly from hardware vendors 
our cost of revenues net of hardware costs increased to million in while our revenues net of hardware cost decreased 
this was primarily due to the increased number of employees in our oss solutions business unit and lower margins on hardware pass through 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased in to million 
gross profit as a percentage of gross revenues  or gross margin  increased to in  as compared to in the increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to the smaller amount of low margin hardware pass through revenue recognized in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to in  as compared to in  primarily due to the increased number of employees in the oss solutions business unit and lower margins on hardware pass through 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses decreased to million in  from million in these decreases resulted from cost cutting measures implemented during the year  including a headcount decrease and a salary cut for employees at the manager level and above 
we expect to continue to maintain tight cost controls in sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in  from million in this decrease was partially attributable to the integration of our sales teams within communications solutions  the integration of bonson s sales team into oss solutions  reductions in staff  reduced efforts in international and channel sales  and tighter control of our marketing expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in  from million in we plan to continue to reduce general and administrative expenses as part of our cost cutting efforts 
research and development expenses increased to million in  from million in  due to our continued focus on developing new software products and solutions for china s telecom carriers 
we recognized a charge of million for amortization of intangible assets in related to our acquisition of bonson 
as a result of that acquisition  we will amortize a total of million in intangible assets over a remaining period of two to three and a half years 
income from operations 
our operating income for decreased to million 
this decrease in profitability was attributable to our decrease in revenue and the partially fixed nature of our cost structure 
bonson contributed of our operating profit for the year 
other income expenses 
other income expenses  consisting primarily of net interest income and expense  decreased from income of approximately million in to income of million in  partially due to a decrease in interest rates and our having less cash on our balance sheet as a result of our acquisition of bonson 
the decrease was also due to our recording a charge of million to provide for a promissory note receivable the collection of which we have determined to be not reasonably assured 
income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased to million in from approximately million in  primarily due to a decrease in our net taxable income for the year ended december  minority interest 
in  minority interest of million represented the portion of our loss before minority interests attributable to the minority shareholders of two of our subsidiaries  marsec and guangdong wangying information technology co 
ltd  or guangdong wangying 
equity in loss of affiliates 
equity in loss of affiliate in of approximately million included our proportionate share of the loss incurred by intrinsic  in which we hold a equity interest  as well as an impairment charge of approximately million we recorded in connection with that investment 
net income loss 
net income decreased to million in  or per share on a fully diluted basis  from million  or per share on a fully diluted basis in bonson contributed of total net income in excluding the impairment charge related to intrinsic and the million provision for a promissory note receivable  our net income would have been us million  or per share on a fully diluted basis  in we expect net income in to be in the range or million to million or to per basic share 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues  including hardware pass through  increased to million in  from million in revenues net of hardware costs increased approximately  to million in software solutions revenues were million in  representing of total revenues net of hardware costs and a increase over software solutions revenues from the previous year 
we experienced significant net revenue growth in as the overall market for network infrastructure software and solutions continued to grow in china 
although our net revenues in each quarter of grew as compared to the comparable periods in  we experienced a sequential decline in net revenues during the fourth quarter of software solutions revenues were million  down as compared to the preceding quarter  and total net revenues were million  down approximately as compared to the preceding quarter 
this sequential decline was attributable to a slow down in network infrastructure spending resulting from the announcement of the restructuring of certain state controlled telecommunications companies in china  including china telecom 
for more information on the restructuring  please see the discussion above under the heading item business industry background 
cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues decreased to million in  primarily due to a decrease in total hardware costs to million 
this decrease in total hardware costs illustrated our continuing focus on high end solutions as opposed to hardware resale in our cost of revenues net of hardware costs increased to million in while our revenues net of hardware cost increased 
gross profit 
our gross profit increased to million in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was in  as compared to in  reflecting a large contribution from our higher margin software solutions revenues and our increasing focus on high end network solutions projects 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses  nearly half of which consisted of sales and marketing expenses  increased to million in sales and marketing expenses in grew at a slightly lower rate than total operating expenses  and decreased substantially to million in the fourth quarter of as compared to million in the fourth quarter of and million in the immediately preceding quarter 
this decrease was a direct result of effective cost control measures we implemented in the fourth quarter to counteract the impact of the planned telecommunications industry restructuring in china 
research and development expenses increased to million in the growth rate in research and development in was slower as compared to that in because our previous research and development investments reached a level of scalability in general and administrative expenses increased to million in other income and expenses 
other income and expenses  consisting primarily of net interest income and expense  decreased to income of million in from income of million in  primarily due to a decrease in our interest income attributable to lower interest rates and lower cash balances held during income tax expense 
income tax expense increased to million in from approximately  in  primarily due to an increase in our net income for the year ended december  minority interest 
in  minority interest of approximately  represented the portion of our income before minority interests attributable to the minority shareholders of two of our subsidiaries  marsec and guangdong wangying 
equity in loss of affiliates 
in april  we invested million in intrinsic for a interest in that company 
our provision for equity in loss of affiliate of  included amortization of goodwill in the amount of approximately  net income loss 
net income increased to million in  or per share on a fully diluted basis  as compared to a net loss of million in selected unaudited quarterly combined results of operations the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for the four quarters ended december  and we believe this unaudited information has been prepared substantially on the same basis as the annual audited combined financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
we believe this data includes all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation 
you should read the quarterly data together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
the consolidated results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period 
we expect that our quarterly revenues may fluctuate significantly

our revenues and operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors 
in particular  our business is characterized by limited numbers of large projects 
as discussed above  the majority of revenues for a project are recognized at the point of hardware delivery 
thus  in any given quarter  we may recognize exceptionally large or exceptionally small amounts of revenue  depending on the timing of hardware delivery and size of the project 
we believe that our business is subject to a certain degree of seasonality 
in particular  orders tend to be slow in the first quarter because of two major chinese holidays during this period  including the chinese lunar new year 
in addition  the chinese government conducts its internal budgetary review and allocation process during this period  which has the effect of delaying project commitments by our customers 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements are primarily working capital requirements related to hardware sales and costs associated with the expansion of our business  such as research and development and sales and marketing expenses 
we recognize hardware costs in full upon delivery of the hardware to our customers 
in order to minimize our working capital requirements  we generally obtain from our hardware vendors payment terms that are timed to permit us to receive payment from our customers for the hardware before our payments to hardware vendors are due 
however  we sometimes obtain less favorable payment terms from our customers  thereby increasing our working capital requirements 
see factors affecting our operating results and our common stock our working capital requirements may increase significantly 
we have historically financed our working capital and other financing requirements through careful management of our billing cycle  private placements of equity securities  our initial public offering in march of and  to a limited extent  bank loans 
our accounts receivable balance at december  was million  consisting of million in billed receivables and million in unbilled receivables 
our billed receivables are based on revenue we have booked and billed 
our unbilled receivables are based on revenue we have booked through the percentage completion method  but for which we have not yet billed the customer 
for example  we recognize revenues for hardware pass through at the time the hardware is accepted by the customer  based on the cost of the underlying hardware 
however  our contracts with our customers will often allow the customers to withhold of the total contract payments until final project acceptance  which on average is eight to nine months after hardware delivery 
as a result  revenues from hardware pass through generally represent a significant portion of our unbilled receivables and can cause the aging of these receivables to be relatively long 
at december   our days sales outstanding were days  as compared to days as of the end of the third quarter 
our billed receivables were days sales outstanding and our unbilled receivables were days sales outstanding 
the improvement in our days sales outstanding as compared to the end of the third quarter is primarily attributable to improved collection efforts and efficient delivery services 
as of december   we had short term credit facilities totaling million  expiring in october   for working capital purposes  of which unused short term credit facilities were million  with million having been used as security for issuing standby letters of credit to hardware suppliers and customers 
in addition to the short term credit facilities  we had a short term loan in renminbi of million as of december  for bonson s working capital purposes  secured by bonson s assets 
the renminbi loan bears interest at a rate of per annum and is repayable upon demand by the lending bank 
bank deposits pledged as security for these credit facilities totaled million as of december   and are presented as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   we were committed under certain operating leases  requiring annual minimum rentals of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we ended the year with a cash position of million  of which million was in short term investments  million was in restricted cash and million was in cash and cash equivalents 
the million in restricted cash consists of million used to secure our million credit facility  million used as security for issuing a standby letter of credit and million held by bonson and pledged as security for a bank guarantee 
our short term investments feature fixed income  liquidity and low risk 
the cash equivalents include investments in cash management accounts to enhance our interest income 
we had net operating cash inflow of million in  primarily attributable to the reduction of our days sales outstanding 
our inventory position at the end of was approximately million  up from million at the beginning of the year 
this increase was attributable to the quarter ending in the middle of delivery windows for certain large projects with significant hardware components 
we anticipate that the net proceeds of our initial public offering in march  together with available funds and cash flows generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital  capital expenditures and business expansion through we may need to raise additional funds in the future  however  in order to fund acquisitions  develop new or enhanced services or products  respond to competitive pressures to compete successfully for larger projects involving higher levels of hardware purchases  or if our business otherwise grows more rapidly than we currently predict 
if we do need to raise additional funds  we expect to raise those funds through new issuances of shares of our equity securities in one or more public offerings or private placements  or through credit facilities extended by lending institutions 
in the event that we decide to pay dividends to our shareholders  our ability to pay dividends will depend in part on our ability to receive dividends from our operating subsidiaries in china 
foreign exchange and other regulations in china may restrict our ability to distribute retained earnings from our operating subsidiaries in china or convert those payments from renminbi into foreign currencies 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenues and cost of revenues under customer contracts  warranty obligations  bad debts  income taxes  investment in affiliate  goodwill and other intangible assets  and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenues and cost of revenues 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to adjustments in current periods as the contract progresses to completion 
accordingly  any changes in our estimates would impact our future operating results 
warranty obligations 
we record our estimate of warranty costs at the time of final project acceptance  when all hardware pass through revenue has been recognized 
revisions for estimated warranties may be required in the period in which actual warranty costs become known  thereby impacting our future operating results 
bad debts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the aging of accounts receivables or the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to change  changes to these allowances may be required  which would impact our future operating results 
income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination is made 
investment in affiliate 
we account for our interest in intrinsic technology holdings  ltd  or intrinsic  using the equity method 
intrinsic has incurred operating losses since our investment in april we conducted an asset impairment test during the fourth quarter of in connection with our private equity investments  including our interest in intrinsic  which is recorded on our balance sheet as an investment in affiliate 
as a result of this test  we have recorded an impairment charge of approximately million in investments in affiliates 
sustained operating losses of this affiliate or other adverse events could result in our inability to recover the carrying value of the investment  which may require us to record an additional impairment charge in the future 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge if the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets is less than its recorded amount 
as required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we have completed a transitional goodwill impairment test and have concluded that no impairment of recorded goodwill was necessary as of january  similar impairment tests are required to be performed at least annually going forward 
litigation 
we record contingent liabilities relating to litigation or other loss contingencies when we believe that the likelihood of loss is probable and the amount of the loss can reasonably be estimated 
changes in judgments of outcome and estimated losses are recorded  as necessary  in the period such changes are determined or become known 
any changes in estimates would impact our future operating results 
significant contingent liabilities  which we believe are at least possible  are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses accounting for the recognition of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for years beginning after june  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas nos 
will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in july  the financials accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
such costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity

is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  and we do not anticipate that the statement will have a material impact on our financial statements or results of operations 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation number  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  or fin this interpretation requires certain disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for interim and annual periods after december  and we have adopted those requirements for our financial statements 
the initial recognition and initial measurement requirements of fin are effective prospectively for guarantees issued or modified after december  factors affecting our operating results and our common stock in addition to the other information in this report  the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and our future prospects the growth of our business is dependent on government telecommunications infrastructure and budgetary policies  particularly the allocation of funds to sustain the growth of the telecommunications industry in china 
virtually all of our large customers are directly or indirectly owned or controlled by the government of china 
accordingly  their business strategies  capital expenditure budgets and spending plans are largely decided in accordance with government policies  which  in turn  are determined on a centralized basis at the highest level by the state development and planning commission of china 
as a result  the growth of our business is heavily dependent on government policies for telecommunications infrastructure 
insufficient government allocation of funds to sustain the growth of china s telecommunications industries in the future could reduce the demand for our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business 
on december   in an effort to increase the efficiency of telecommunications service providers through competition  china s state council announced that it would split china telecom geographically into a northern division comprising ten provinces and a southern division comprising provinces 
under the state council s plan  the northern division of china telecom has merged with china netcom and jitong communication  and has been renamed china netcom group  while the southern division operates under the china telecom name 
as a result of the restructuring  new orders for telecommunications infrastructure expansion and improvement projects have decreased over the past several quarters  adversely affecting our backlog and our net revenue 
according to china s ministry of information industry  overall capital expenditure by telecommunications carriers decreased by to billion in the restructuring has also caused widespread personnel shifts in both china telecom and china netcom group  which have slowed or prevented a large number of investment decisions in new infrastructure and network management solutions 
although we expect that the restructuring will have a positive impact on growth in the telecommunications industry in china in the long term and that spending will begin to return to pre restructuring levels in the second half of  continued delays in capital expenditure projects could continue to negatively affect our growth in the near term 
in addition  similar restructurings of this nature could cause our operating results to vary unexpectedly from quarter to quarter in the future 
our customer base is concentrated and the loss of one or more of our customers could cause our business to suffer significantly 
we have derived  and believe that we will continue to derive  a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of large customers  such as china telecom  china unicom  china netcom group and china mobile 
china telecom accounted for almost all of our revenues in in  china telecom  together with china unicom  accounted for almost all of our revenues 
the loss  cancellation or deferral of any large contract by any of our large customers would have a material adverse effect on our revenues  and consequently our profits 
the long and variable sales cycles for our products and services can cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from period to period and may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our revenues and operating results will vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
a customer s decision to purchase our services and products involves a significant commitment of its resources and an extended evaluation 
as a result  our sales cycle tends to be lengthy 
we spend considerable time and expense educating and providing information to prospective customers about features and applications of our services and products 
because our major customers operate large and complex networks  they usually expand their networks in large increments on a sporadic basis 
the combination of these factors can cause our revenues and results of operations to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter 
a large part of the contract amount of our projects usually relates to hardware procurement 
since we recognize most of the revenues relating to hardware plus a portion of services and software revenues at the time of hardware delivery  the timing of hardware delivery can cause our quarterly gross revenues to fluctuate significantly 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance and should not be relied upon 
it is likely that our operating results in some periods may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the price of our common stock will probably decline  perhaps significantly more in percentage terms than any corresponding decline in our operating results 
our working capital requirements may increase significantly 
we typically purchase hardware for our customers as part of our turn key total solutions services 
we generally require our customers to pay to of the invoice value of the hardware upon delivery 
we typically place orders for hardware against back to back orders from customers and seek favorable payment terms from hardware vendors 
this policy has historically minimized our working capital requirements 
however  for certain large and strategically important projects  we have agreed to payment of less than to of the invoice value of the hardware upon delivery in order to maintain competitiveness 
wider adoption of less favorable payment terms or delays in hardware deliveries will require us to increase our working capital needs significantly 
we have sustained losses in prior years and may incur slower earnings growth  earnings declines or net losses in the future 
although we had net income in  and we sustained net losses in and recently  we have experienced a decline in earnings growth and had breakeven net income per share for the fourth quarter of there are no assurances that we can sustain profitability or avoid net losses in the future 
we continue to expect that certain of our operating expenses will increase as our business grows 
the level of these expenses will be largely based on anticipated organizational growth and revenue trends and a high percentage will be fixed 
as a result  any delays in expanding sales volume and generating revenue could result in substantial operating losses 
business acquisitions we undertake may be challenging  and we may realize losses on our investments 
in february of  as a key component of our business and growth strategy  we acquired bonson  a leading provider of operation support system solutions in china 
in the future  we may acquire other companies or assets that we feel will enhance our revenue growth  operations and profitability 
such acquisitions could result in the use of significant amounts of cash and dilutive issuances of our common stock 
such acquisitions involve other significant risks  including 
the difficulties of integrating  assimilating and managing the operations  technologies  intellectual property  products and personnel of the acquired business  
the diversion of management attention from other business concerns  
the additional expense associated with acquired contingent liabilities  
the loss of key employees in acquired businesses  and 
the risk of being sued by terminated employees and contractors 
we will need to integrate and manage any businesses we determine to acquire in the future 
our failure to do so successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
asset impairment reviews may result in future periodic write downs 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
which requires us  among other things  to review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually 
in connection with our business acquisitions  we make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets 
in assessing the related useful lives of those assets  we have to make assumptions regarding their fair value  our recoverability of those assets and our ability to successfully develop and ultimately commercialize acquired technology 
if those assumptions change in the future when we conduct our periodic reviews in accordance with accounting standards  we may be required to record impairment charges 
we have conducted an asset impairment test during the fourth quarter of and recorded an impairment charge of approximately million from our investment in intrinsic 
there is no assurance that future reviews will not result in further write downs to goodwill and other intangible assets 
we are highly dependent on our executive officers 
each of our executive officers is responsible for an important segment of our operations 
although we believe that we have significant depth at all levels of management  the loss of any of our executive officers services could be detrimental to our operations 
we do not have  and do not plan to obtain  key man life insurance on any of our employees 
we face a competitive labor market in china for skilled personnel and therefore are highly dependent on the skills and services of our existing key skilled personnel and our ability to hire additional skilled employees 
competition for highly skilled software design  engineering and sales and marketing personnel is intense in china 
our failure to attract  assimilate or retain qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs could impair our growth 
competition for skilled personnel comes primarily from a wide range of foreign companies active in china  many of which have substantially greater resources than we have 
limitations on our ability to hire and train a sufficient number of personnel at all levels would limit our ability to undertake projects in the future and could cause us to lose market share 
we extend warranties to our customers that expose us to potential liabilities 
we customarily provide our customers with one to three year warranties  under which we agree to maintain installed systems at no additional cost to our customers 
the maintenance services cover both hardware and our proprietary and third party software products 
although we seek to arrange back to back warranties with hardware and software vendors  we have the primary responsibility to maintain the installed hardware and software 
our contracts do not have disclaimers or limitations on liability for special  consequential and incidental damages  nor do we cap the amounts our customers can recover for damages 
in addition  we do not currently maintain any insurance policy with respect to our exposure to warranty claims 
the failure of our installed projects to operate properly could give rise to substantial liability for special  consequential or incidental damages  that in turn could materially and adversely affect us 
we sell our services on a fixed price  fixed time basis which exposes us to risks associated with cost overruns and delays 
we sell most of our services on a fixed price  fixed time basis 
in contracts with our customers  we typically agree to pay late completion fines of up to of the total contract value 
in large scale telecommunications infrastructure projects  there are many factors beyond our control which could cause delays or cost overruns 
in this event  we would be exposed to cost overruns and liable for late completion fines 
we may become less competitive if we are unable to develop or acquire new products or enhancements to our software products that are marketable on a timely and cost effective basis 
we continually develop new services and proprietary software products 
unexpected technical  operational  distribution or other problems could delay or prevent the introduction of one or more of these products or services or any products or services that we may plan to introduce in the future 
moreover  we cannot be sure that any of these products and services will achieve widespread market acceptance or generate incremental revenues 
our proprietary rights may be inadequately protected and there is a risk of poor enforcement of intellectual property rights in china 
our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our intellectual property rights  which we protect through a combination of confidentiality arrangements and copyright and trademark registrations 
we have registered some marks and filed trademark applications for other marks with the united states patent and trademark office  the trademark bureau of the state administration of industry and commerce in china and the trade marks registry in hong kong 
we have also registered copyrights with the state copyright bureau in china with respect to certain of our software products  although we have not applied for copyright protection elsewhere including the united states 
despite these precautions  the legal regime protecting intellectual property rights in china is weak 
moreover  bonson  which we acquired in february   had never registered copyrights for its software products prior to the acquisition 
because the chinese legal system in general  and the intellectual property regime in particular  are relatively weak  it is often difficult to enforce intellectual property rights in china 
in addition  there are other countries where effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited 
we do not own any patents and have not filed any patent applications  as we do not believe that the benefits of patent protection outweigh the costs of filing and updating patents for our software products 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants  and control access to  and distribution of  our documentation and other licensed information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our licensed services or technology without authorization  or to develop similar technology independently 
policing unauthorized use of our licensed technology is difficult and there can be no assurance that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation or infringement of our proprietary technology 
in addition  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources 
a portion of our business involves the development and customization of software applications for customers 
we generally retain significant ownership or rights to use and market such software for other customer projects  where possible 
however  our customers sometimes retain co ownership and rights to use the applications  processes  and intellectual property so developed 
in some cases  we may have no right or only limited rights to reuse or provide these developments in projects involving other customers 
to the extent that we are unable to negotiate contracts which permit us to reuse source codes and methodologies  or to the extent that we have conflicts with our customers regarding our ability to do so  we may be unable to provide similar solutions to our other customers 
we are exposed to certain business and litigation risks with respect to technology rights held by third parties 
we currently license technology from third parties and intend to do so increasingly in the future as we introduce services that require new technology 
there can be no assurance that these technology licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
our inability to obtain any of these licenses could delay or compromise our ability to introduce new services 
in addition  we may or may allegedly breach the technology rights of others and incur legal expenses and damages  which could be substantial 
investors may not be able to enforce judgments by united states courts against certain of our officers and directors 
we are incorporated in the state of delaware 
however  a majority of our directors and executive officers  and certain of our principal shareholders  live outside of the united states  principally in beijing and hong kong 
as a result  you may not be able to 
effect service of process upon those persons within the united states  or 
enforce against those persons judgments obtained in united states courts  including judgments relating to the federal securities laws of the united states 
we do not intend to pay and may be restricted from paying dividends on our common stock 
we have never declared or paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not intend to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future 
we currently intend to retain future earnings to fund our growth 
furthermore  if we decide to pay dividends  foreign exchange and other regulations in china may restrict our ability to distribute retained earnings from china or convert those payments from renminbi  the currency of china  into foreign currencies 
the fact that our business is conducted in both us dollars and renminbi may subject us to currency exchange rate risk due to fluctuations in the exchange rate between those two currencies 
substantially all of our revenues  expenses and liabilities are denominated in either us dollars or renminbi 
as a result  we are subject to the effects of exchange rate fluctuations between those currencies 
because of the unitary exchange rate system introduced in china on january   the official bank exchange rate for conversion of renminbi to us dollars experienced a devaluation of approximately 
we report our financial results in us dollars  therefore  any future devaluation of the renminbi against the us dollar may have an adverse effect on our reported net income 
substantially all our revenues and expenses relating to hardware sales are denominated in us dollars  and substantially all our revenues and expenses relating to the software and services component of our business are denominated in renminbi 
although  in general  our exposure to foreign exchange risks should be limited  the value in our shares may be affected by the foreign exchange rate between the us dollar and the renminbi because the value of our business is effectively denominated in renminbi  while our shares are traded in us dollars 
furthermore  a decline in the value of the renminbi could reduce the us dollar value of earnings from  and our investments in  our subsidiaries in china 
the markets in which we sell our services and products are competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively 
the market for network solutions in china is new and rapidly changing 
our competitors in the network solutions market mainly include domestic systems integrators such as zoom networks  openet information technology shenzhen corporation  digital china holdings limited and legend group limited 
although we are a leading player in this market  there are many large multinational companies with substantial  existing information technology operations in other markets in china that have significantly greater financial  technological  marketing and human resources 
should they decide to enter the network solutions market  this could hurt our profitability and erode our market share 
the service application solutions sector is highly competitive 
our principal competitor in that sector is openwave systems inc formerly software 
com and phone 
com 
in the network security solutions market  we mainly compete with information security one limited  nsfocus information technology co  ltd  and vianet china inc an increasing number of companies are devoting their resources to this sector in developing network security products 
in the network monitoring solutions market  our principal competitor is emerson electric co 
through its acquisition of avansys power co  ltd 
from huawei technologies 
in the operation support system solutions market  we compete with both international and local software and solutions providers 
in the online billing segment  we compete primarily with portal software  mind cti ltd  and zoom networks  and in the wireless billing segment we compete mainly with more than eight local competitors 
we also expect to compete with more than ten local competitors in the fixed line oss market 
currently  due in part to each telecommunication provider s stringent approval system for providers of wireless billing software in china and competitive pricing offered by domestic companies  some multinational information technology companies have been deterred from entering this market 
however  multinational companies have recently formed alliances with chinese companies to expand into china s telecommunications solutions market 
for example  csg systems  or csg  has formed a strategic alliance with a subsidiary of legend group limited to develop a suite of customer care and billing solutions for china s telecommunications carriers 
in view of the gradual deregulation of the chinese telecommunications industry and china s entry into the wto  we anticipate the entrance of new competitors into the operation support system market 
our competitors  some of whom have greater financial  technical and human resources than us  may be able to respond more quickly to new and emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of new products or services 
it is possible that competition in the form of new competitors or alliances  joint ventures or consolidation among existing competitors may decrease our market share 
increased competition could result in lower personnel utilization rates  billing rate reductions  fewer customer engagements  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could materially and adversely affect our profits and overall financial condition 
political and economic policies of the chinese government could affect our industry in general and our competitive position in particular 
since the establishment of the people s republic of china in  the communist party has been the governing political party in china 
the highest bodies of leadership are the politburo of the communist party  the central committee and the national people s congress 
the state council  which is the highest institution of government administration  reports to the national people s congress and has under its supervision various commissions  agencies and ministries  including the ministry of information industry  the telecommunications regulatory body of the chinese government 
since the late s  the chinese government has been reforming the chinese economic system 
although we believe that economic reform and the macroeconomic measures adopted by the chinese government have had and will continue to have a positive effect on economic development in china  there can be no assurance that the economic reform strategy will not from time to time be modified or revised 
such modifications or revisions  if any  could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of china and investment in the internet and the telecommunications industry in china 
such developments could reduce  perhaps significantly  the demand for our products and services 
furthermore  changes in political  economic and social conditions in china  adjustments in policies of the chinese government or changes in laws and regulations could adversely affect our industry in general and our competitive position in particular 
high technology and emerging market shares have historically experienced extreme volatility and may subject you to losses 
the trading price of our shares may be subject to significant market volatility due to investor perceptions of investments relating to china and asia  as well as developments in the internet and telecommunications industries 
in addition  the high technology sector of the stock market frequently experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many software companies and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies 
if our stock price is volatile  we may become subject to securities litigation  which is expensive and could result in a diversion of resources 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
many companies in our industry have been subject to this type of litigation in the past  and we are currently involved in this type of litigation as a result of allegedly improper allocation procedures relating to the sale of our common stock in connection with our initial public offering in march of for more information on that litigation  please see the discussion under the heading item legal proceedings in part i of this report 
litigation is often expensive and diverts management s attention and resources  which could materially and adversely affect our business 
future sales of shares by existing shareholders could cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options  the market price of our common stock could fall 
such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
a small number of shareholders controls us 
a small number of shareholders  including warburg pincus ventures  chinavest group  and their affiliates  as well as edward tian  one of our directors  james ding  our president and chief executive officer  and louis lau  our chairman  control over of our voting stock 
as a result  these shareholders collectively are able to control all matters requiring shareholder approval  including election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions  such as a sale of our assets and the terms of future equity financings 
the combined voting power of our large shareholders could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
we are subject to anti takeover provisions that could prevent a change of control and prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium on their common stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of our preferred stock 
without any further vote or action on the part of our stockholders  the board of directors has the authority to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock 
this preferred stock  if it is ever issued  may have preference over and harm the rights of the holders of our common stock 
although the issuance of this preferred stock will provide us with flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  such an issuance may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
we currently have authorized the size of our board of directors to be not less than three nor more than nine directors 
the terms of the office of the eight member board of directors have been divided into three classes class i  whose term will expire at the annual meeting of the stockholders to be held in  class ii  whose term will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in  and class iii  whose term will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in this classification of the board of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in our control or management 
we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
in general  the statute prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date when the person became an interested stockholder unless  subject to exceptions  the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner 
generally  a business combination includes a merger  asset or stock sale  or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the stockholder 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily associated with our cash  short term investments and short term bank loans 
to date  we have not entered into any types of derivatives to hedge against interest rate changes  nor do we speculate in foreign currency 
however  we do maintain a significant portion of our cash deposits in us dollars to avoid currency risk related to renminbi 
a portion of these us dollar deposits are used to collateralize renminbi denominated loans from chinese banks 
because substantially all of our revenues and expenses relating to hardware sales are denominated in us dollars  and substantially all of our revenues and expenses relating to the service and software components of our business and software business are denominated in renminbi  we do not have significant exposure to either the us dollar or renminbi 
thus  we do not believe that it is necessary to enter into derivatives contracts to hedge our exposures to either currency 
there have been no significant changes in our exposure to changes in either interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates for the year ended december  our exposure to interest rates is limited as we do not have variable rate and long term borrowings 
we are subject to variable interest rates on our bank deposits that are short term investments 
as there are no significant market price movements  such investments are held at cost 
as of december   a hypothetical immediate increase or decrease in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately  or decrease our annual interest income by approximately  respectively 
the effect of changes in exchange rates on our results of operations has been insignificant
