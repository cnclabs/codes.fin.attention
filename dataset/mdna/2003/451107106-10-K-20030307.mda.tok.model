introduction in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a  the general financial condition and results of operations for idacorp  inc and subsidiaries idacorp and idaho power company and its subsidiary ipc are discussed 
idacorp is a holding company formed in as the parent of ipc  idacorp energy ie and several other entities 
ipc is an electric utility with a service territory covering over  square miles  primarily in southern idaho and eastern oregon 
ipc is the parent of idaho energy resources co  a joint venturer in bridger coal company  which supplies coal to the jim bridger generating plant owned in part by ipc 
idacorp announced in that ie  a marketer of electricity and natural gas  would wind down its operations 
idacorp s other significant operating subsidiaries are ida west energy ida west developer and manager of independent power projects  idatech developer of integrated fuel cell systems  idacorp financial services  inc ifs affordable housing and other real estate investments  velocitus commercial and residential internet service provider  and idacomm provider of telecommunications services 
as you read the md a  it may be helpful to refer to the consolidated financial statements of idacorp and ipc which present the financial position at december  and  and the results of operations and cash flows for each company for the years ended december   and forward looking information in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of reform act  idacorp and ipc are hereby filing cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements as such term is defined in the reform act made by or on behalf of idacorp or ipc in this annual report on form k  any quarterly report on form q  in presentations  in response to questions or otherwise 
any statements that express  or involve discussions as to expectations  beliefs  plans  objectives  assumptions or future events or performance often  but not always  through the use of words or phrases such as anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  intends  plans  predicts  projects  will likely result  will continue  or similar expressions are not statements of historical facts and may be forward looking 
forward looking statements involve estimates  assumptions  and uncertainties and are qualified in their entirety by reference to  and are accompanied by  the following important factors  which are difficult to predict  contain uncertainties  are beyond our control and may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements changes in governmental policies and regulatory actions  including those of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  the idaho public utilities commission ipuc and the oregon public utility commission opuc  with respect to allowed rates of return  industry and rate structure  acquisition and disposal of assets and facilities  operation and construction of plant facilities  recovery of purchased power and other capital investments  and present or prospective wholesale and retail competition including but not limited to retail wheeling and transmission costs and other refund proceedings  litigation resulting from the energy situation in the western united states  economic  geographic and political factors and risks  changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and policies  weather variations affecting customer energy usage  operating performance of plants and other facilities  changes in environmental conditions and requirements  system conditions and operating costs  population growth rates and demographic patterns  pricing and transportation of commodities  market demand and prices for energy  including structural market changes  changes in capacity and fuel availability and prices  changes in tax rates or policies  interest rates or rates of inflation  changes in actuarial assumptions  adoption or changes in critical accounting policies or estimates  exposure to operational  market and credit risk in energy trading and marketing operations  changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures  capital market conditions  rating actions by moody s  standard poor s s p and fitch  competition for new energy development opportunities  results of financing efforts  including the ability to obtain financing on favorable terms  which can be affected by various factors  including credit ratings and general economic conditions  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism  legal and administrative proceedings whether civil or criminal and settlements that influence business and profitability  and new accounting or securities and exchange commission requirements  or new interpretation or application of existing requirements 
any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made 
new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors  nor can it assess the impact of any such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement 
risk factors the following are some important factors that could have a significant impact on the operations and financial results of idacorp and ipc and could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in any forward looking statements ipc has a predominately hydroelectric generating base 
because of its heavy reliance on inexpensive hydroelectric generation  ipc s operations can be significantly affected by the weather 
ipc is currently forecasting that the year will be its fourth consecutive year of below normal water conditions 
when hydroelectric generation is reduced because of below normal water conditions  ipc must increase its use of more expensive thermal generation and purchased power 
although ipc generally recovers certain increased power costs through its power cost adjustment pca  the recovery is on a deferred basis and is subject to the regulatory process 
ipc is currently involved in renewing federal licenses for certain of its hydroelectric projects 
ipc currently expects new licenses for five middle snake river region hydroelectric plants to be issued in in addition  ipc expects to file the license application in july for the hells canyon complex  which provides percent of ipc s total generating capacity 
ipc cannot predict what conditions  if any  with respect to environmental  operating and other matters the ferc may impose in connection with the renewal of these licenses and the effect of any such conditions on ipc s operations 
idacorp and ipc are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental statutes  rules and regulations relating to air quality  water quality  natural resources and health and safety 
there are significant capital  operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes  rules and regulations  and those costs could be even more significant in the future as a result of  among other factors  changes in legislation and enforcement policies and additional requirements imposed in connection with the relicensing of ipc s hydroelectric projects 
ipc currently anticipates filing a general rate case with the ipuc by the end of the year the rate case is being filed as a result of capital expenditures made and increased operating costs experienced by ipc since  the last rate case test year except for those capital costs associated with construction of the milner and expansion of the twin falls hydroelectric projects which were included in rates in ipc cannot predict the outcome of this case or the effect on its operations if the requested rate relief is not granted 
idacorp and ipc are subject to direct and indirect effects of terrorist threats and activities 
generation and transmission facilities  in general  have been identified as potential targets 
the effects of terrorist threats and activities include  among other things  actions or responses to such actions or threats  the inability to generate  purchase or transmit power  and the increased cost and adequacy of security and insurance 
ipc and its affiliate  ie  may be subject to potential liabilities as a result of energy marketing operations 
although ie is currently winding down its energy marketing operations  certain matters have been identified that require resolution with the ferc and the ipuc 
should the ferc conclude that its regulations or rate schedules were not complied with  it has significant discretion as to the appropriate remedies  if any 
the ferc s remedial authority includes the authority to require refunds  to order equitable relief  to suspend the authorization to sell wholesale power at market based rates  and  in some instances  to impose monetary penalties 
in an ipuc proceeding that has been underway since may  ipc and the ipuc staff have been working to determine the appropriate compensation ie should provide to ipc as a result of transactions between the affiliates since february ipc and ie do not believe that resolution of these transactions will have any adverse impact on retail customers or a material adverse effect on their ongoing operations 
however  because it cannot be predicted at this point what regulatory actions might be taken or when  it cannot be determined what effect there may be on the companies financial statements and whether it will be material 
idacorp  ie and ipc are subject to costs and other effects of legal and administrative proceedings  settlements  investigations and claims  including those that may arise out of the california energy situation 
regarding the california energy situation  idacorp  ie and ipc are involved in a number of proceedings including a complaint filed against sellers of power in california  based on california s unfair competition law  a cross action wholesale electric antitrust case against various sellers and generators of power in california and the california refund proceeding at the ferc 
other cases which are the direct or indirect result of the energy crisis in california include efforts by certain public parties to reform or terminate contracts for the purchase of power from ie and the northwest refund case at the ferc 
it is possible that additional proceedings may be filed against or by idacorp  ie or ipc related to the california energy crisis in the future 
idacorp and ipc rely on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows 
access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality 
an inability to raise capital on favorable terms  particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets  could impact the liquidity of idacorp and ipc and would likely increase their interest costs 
it could also affect the companies ability to implement their business plans 
the issues and associated risks and uncertainties described above are not the only ones idacorp and ipc may face 
additional issues may arise or become material 
the risks and uncertainties associated with these additional issues could impair idacorp s and ipc s businesses in the future 
summary of results and outlook overall results idacorp s overall results show earnings per share eps of  a decrease of from ipc s eps increased from in to in despite the operational impacts of continued below normal streamflow conditions on ipc s hydro system and reduced general business sales 
at ie  eps decreased significantly from in to a current year loss of 
ie s results have been significantly impacted by deteriorating credit  substantially reduced pricing spreads  and low volatility in the western wholesale energy markets as well as the decision to wind down energy marketing operations 
idacorp s results also reflect an million partial write down of ida west s investment in equipment related to the proposed garnet energy project 
since the announcement to wind down its energy marketing operations  ie has recorded million in severance expenses  non cancelable lease liabilities and asset impairments  among other matters 
ie has reduced its workforce from a peak last year of to fewer than employees as of december  further reductions in the workforce to approximately employees are expected by july utility operations benefited from a tax accounting method change that allowed ipc to record a million tax benefit 
million of this benefit is attributable to and prior years 
this benefit was partially offset by expensing million in lost irrigation revenues disallowed by the ipuc 
ipc disagrees with the ipuc s decision to disallow recovery of the million in lost irrigation revenues and has filed an appeal with the idaho supreme court seeking to overturn the ipuc s decision 
ipc filed its brief on january  it is anticipated that this case will not be decided by the idaho supreme court until late or early if successful  ipc would record any amount recovered as revenue 
hydroelectric generation and below normal water conditions the following table presents ipc s system generation for the last three years mwh percent of total generation hydroelectric thermal total system generation ipc relies on low cost hydroelectric plants for a significant portion of its power supply 
ipc s hydroelectric generation has decreased since as ipc has experienced three years of below normal water conditions 
under normal streamflow conditions  ipc s generation mix is percent hydro and percent thermal 
the amount of electricity ipc is able to generate from its hydro plants depends primarily on the snowpack in the mountains above its hydro facilities  reservoir storage and streamflow conditions 
current snake river basin snowpack numbers suggest that streamflow conditions for will remain below normal 
ipc s march accumulations were percent of normal  compared to percent at the same time a year earlier 
the us weather service s river forecast center at this time is predicting april through july inflow into brownlee reservoir will be million acre feet maf 
the normal year average for inflow during that time is maf 
based on the above snowpack and forecasted inflows  ipc is expecting its fourth year of below normal water conditions 
ipc currently plans to use wholesale purchases from the energy markets when necessary to meet its energy needs during integrated resource plan on february   the ipuc issued order no 
that accepted and acknowledged ipc s integrated resource plan irp  which identified ipc s options to meet potential electricity shortfalls expected by mid the accepted irp indicated the purchase of mw from the wholesale market for ipc s retail customers during june  july  november and december the months when it is difficult for ipc to generate enough electricity to meet its customer needs 
other options identified by ipc include seasonal energy exchanges with other utilities  obtaining firm transmission rights  construction of new generating resources  and purchasing capacity from new generating resources 
on february   ipc issued a formal request for proposals rfp seeking bids for the construction of up to mw of additional generation to support the growing seasonal demand for electricity in ipc s service area 
notice of an intent to bid must be submitted to ipc by march  power cost adjustment and general rate relief at december   the pca deferral balance has decreased by million from december  this decrease is attributable to a percent decline in the price of wholesale electricity purchased power costs 
when the new pca year starts in may  ipc expects that retail rates for most customer categories in idaho will decrease 
the amount of pca costs not recovered through the pca mechanism was approximately million in compared to approximately million in with more normal market prices and water conditions  ipc would absorb lesser or no amounts 
while the pca has been a valuable tool for ipc during the energy crisis and increased power supply costs in and  it has not provided revenue recovery related to ipc s other costs of serving its customers such as increased operating expenses and substantial demands for infrastructure improvements 
additionally  ipc is expecting increased capital costs for the protection  mitigation and enhancement requirements of new licenses for some of its hydroelectric projects  its need for new sources of power supply and the need to continue the expansion of its transmission and distribution network 
as a result of the items mentioned above  ipc anticipates filing a general rate case with the ipuc before year end this will be ipc s first general rate case filing since ipc anticipates the request for an increase will be substantially less than the expected pca related rate decrease expected in may legal issues and regulatory matters idacorp  ipc and ie have been named as defendants in various legal cases during these cases continue to be reviewed on an ongoing basis 
at this time  the companies believe they have meritorious defenses to all lawsuits and legal proceedings and are making a continuous effort for resolution of all outstanding matters 
at the time of this filing  the companies have settled legal proceedings with truckee donner public utility district truckee without material adverse effect on their consolidated financial positions  results of operations or cash flows 
the case filed by the public utility district no 
of grays harbor county  washington grays harbor was dismissed with prejudice on january  ie and ipc voluntarily contacted the ferc in september to discuss certain matters that needed to be resolved in connection with the wind down of energy marketing at ie  and the companies have provided certain documents and information to the ferc at its request 
on february   the ferc resolved one of the matters  approving the assignment of certain wholesale power and transmission services agreements from ipc to ie 
liquidity idacorp and ipc s operating cash flows in were million and million  respectively  driven by collections of outstanding pca amounts  reduced power supply costs and the receipt of tax refunds 
the increased cash flows were used to pay down short term debt and redeem ipc s auction rate preferred stock 
operating cash flow for will be supported by ongoing collections of past pca deferrals and continued cash collections during the wind down of the energy marketing business 
idacorp has budgeted approximately million for capital expenditures in of which million will be for capital expenditures at ipc 
approximately percent of the budgeted amounts at ipc are dedicated to its delivery system  percent is for support of its power supply and relicensing efforts and percent is for general plant and administrative expenditures 
pension expense is expected to increase from approximately in to approximately million in of this amount  approximately percent will impact ipc s operation and maintenance expense 
at the end of  the projected benefit obligation exceeded pension assets by approximately million 
based on current estimates  cash contributions in are not expected 
idacorp has committed to continue to reduce its reliance on short term borrowings during idacorp is reviewing options that may include refinancing debt at ifs and ipc 
idacorp and ipc have credit facilities that expire in march accordingly  both companies expect to have renewed these facilities by the end of first quarter the amount and timing of dividends payable on idacorp s common stock are within the sole discretion of idacorp s board of directors 
the board of directors reviews the dividend rate quarterly to determine its appropriateness in light of idacorp s financial position and results of operations  legislative and regulatory developments affecting the electric utility industry in general and ipc in particular  competitive conditions and any other factors the board of directors deems relevant 
the ability of idacorp to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries  primarily ipc 
ipc s articles of incorporation contain restrictions on the payment of dividends on its common stock if preferred stock dividends are in arrears 
ipc paid dividends to idacorp of million annually in  and financing activities during the fourth quarter of  ipc issued million of first mortgage bonds in two series 
the proceeds were used to pay down short term debt at ipc 
ipc is in the process of establishing a million shelf registration to facilitate future financing needs 
at this time idacorp does not anticipate issuing equity securities during the balance of other than through the normal course of its various stock plans 
critical accounting policies idacorp and ipc s discussion and analysis of their financial condition and results of operations are based upon their consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires idacorp and ipc to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  idacorp and ipc evaluate these estimates  including those related to rate regulation  mark to market accounting on energy trading contracts  contingencies  litigation  income taxes  restructuring costs  benefit costs and bad debts 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions and factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and are the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
idacorp and ipc  based on their ongoing reviews  will make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 
idacorp and ipc believe the following critical accounting policies are important to the portrayal of their financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
accounting for rate regulation a regulated company must satisfy the following conditions in order to apply the accounting policies and practices of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  an independent regulator must set rates  the regulator must set the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service  and the service territory must lack competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator 
sfas requires companies that meet the above conditions to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in its consolidated financial statements and requires that certain costs be deferred as regulatory assets until matching revenues can be recognized 
similarly  certain items may be deferred as regulatory liabilities and amortized to the income statement as rates to customers are reduced 
ipc follows sfas  and its financial statements reflect the effects of the different rate making principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating ipc 
the primary result of this policy is that ipc has deferred million of regulatory assets and million of regulatory liabilities at december  while ipc expects to fully recover these regulatory assets or return these regulatory liabilities  such recovery is subject to final review by the regulatory entities 
if ipc should determine in the future that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of sfas  it could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities unless regulators specify some other means of recovery or refund 
ipc intends to seek recovery of all of its prudent costs  including stranded costs  in the event of deregulation 
however  due to the current lack of definitive legislation  ipc cannot predict whether it will be successful 
mark to market accounting for energy marketing contracts ie values its energy trading contracts using mark to market accounting under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
this accounting requires ie to consider several factors  including current relevant market prices  market depth and liquidity  potential model error  and expected credit losses at the counterparty level 
due to the volatility of energy markets and certain model assumptions  changes in market conditions could substantially change the amounts of gains or losses ultimately realized in settlement of the contracts 
marking a contract to market consists of reevaluating the market value of the entire term of the contract at each reporting period and reflecting the resulting gain or loss of value in earnings for the period 
this change in value represents the difference between the contract price and the current market value of the contract 
the change in market value of the contract could result in large gains or losses recorded in earnings at each subsequent reporting period unless there are off setting changes in value of off setting contracts 
the gain or loss in income generated from the change in market value of the energy trading contracts is a non cash event 
if these contracts are held to maturity  the cash flow from the contracts  and their off setting contracts  is realized over the life of the contract 
when determining the fair value of marketing and trading contracts  ie uses actively quoted prices for contracts with similar terms as the quoted price  including specific delivery points and maturities 
to determine fair value of contracts with terms that are not consistent with actively quoted prices  ie uses when available prices provided by other external sources 
when prices from external sources are not available  ie determines prices by using internal pricing models that incorporate available current and historical pricing information 
finally  the fair market value of contracts is adjusted for the impact of market depth and liquidity  potential model error  and expected credit losses at the counterparty level 
the following table details the gross margin booked from marketing operations over the last three years gross margin realized or otherwise settled unrealized total gross margin at year end  percent of the credit exposure related to ie s unrealized positions was with investment grade counterparties  two percent was with non investment grade counterparties and the remaining percent was with non rated counterparties 
the majority of the non rated entities are municipalities  public utility districts and electric cooperatives 
the change in net fair value energy marketing assets less energy marketing liabilities between year end and year end is explained as follows net fair value of contracts outstanding as of contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period changes in net fair values attributable to changes in valuation techniques and assumptions changes in net fair value attributable to market prices and other market changes net fair value of contracts outstanding as of the fair value of energy marketing and trading contracts is an accounting estimate based on reasonable assumptions related to interest rates  energy prices and price volatility 
different assumptions regarding these variables could result in a change to the net fair value of energy marketing and trading contracts 
the following table shows the estimated adverse change to the reported fair value of energy marketing and trading contracts for defined adverse moves associated with the key assumptions incorporated into this estimate adverse move in fair value change in assumption used in fair value calculation change in interest rates mwh change in electricity prices mmbtu change in gas prices change in volatility the following table presents the net fair value of contracts outstanding at december   disaggregated by source of fair value and maturity of contracts maturity maturity less than maturity maturity in excess of source of fair value year years years years total prices actively quoted prices provided by other external sources prices based on models and other valuation methods total prices actively quoted are quoted daily by brokers and trading exchanges such as nymex  tfs  intercontinental and bloomberg 
the time horizon is january through december products include physical  financial  swap  interest rate  index and basis for both natural gas and heavy load power 
prices provided by other external sources are quoted periodically by brokers and trading exchanges such as tfs  apb  prebon  intercontinental and bloomberg 
the time horizon is january through december products include physical  financial  swap  index and basis for both natural gas and heavy and light load power 
prices derived from models and other valuation methods incorporate available current and historical pricing information 
the time horizon is january through december products include transmission  options  and ancillary services related to heavy and light load power 
pension expense ipc maintains a qualified defined benefit pension plan qualified plan covering most employees and an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan for certain senior management employees and directors 
pension income expense for these plans totaled million  million and million for the three years ended december   and  respectively  including amounts allocated to capitalized labor costs 
pension expense is dependent on several assumptions used in the actuarial valuation of the plan 
the primary assumptions are the long term return on plan assets and the discount rate 
annually  these assumptions are reviewed in light of changes in market conditions  trends  and future expectations 
these assumptions and the results of actuarial valuations are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
if these assumptions had been different  the net amounts of pension expense recorded could have varied significantly 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on the qualified plan assets by percent from percent to percent would have increased pension expense for by approximately million 
lowering the discount rate by percent would have increased pension expense for by approximately million 
the value of the qualified plan assets has decreased from million at december  to million at december  the investment performance returns and declining discount rates have changed the funded status of the qualified plan  net of benefit obligations  from being overfunded by million at december  to being underfunded by million at december  despite the recent reductions in the funded status of the qualified plan  ipc believes that  based on current actuarial assumptions  it will not be required to make any cash contributions to the qualified plan in contingent liabilities a number of unresolved issues related to regulatory  legal and tax matters are discussed throughout the md a 
contingent liabilities are provided for in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies 
according to sfas  an estimated loss from a loss contingency shall be charged to income if a it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and b the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure in the notes to the financial statements is required for loss contingencies not meeting both those conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred 
gain contingencies are not recorded until earned 
for all such significant matters  best estimates of the ultimate resolution have been made  and  if the recognition criteria of sfas have been met  reserves have been recorded 
the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the current financial statements 
results of operations in this section idacorp s earnings and the factors that affected them are discussed  beginning with a general overview followed by a more detailed discussion of the electric utility and energy marketing activities for the years ended december   and earnings per share of common stock utility operations energy marketing other operations total earnings per share return on year end common equity eps from utility operations increased for the year ended december  major changes occurring at the utility caused the following fluctuations in eps net power supply costs absorbed by the utility decreased million  increasing eps 
a change to the utility s tax accounting method for capitalized overhead costs created a tax benefit of million or a increase to eps 
lost revenue of million was expensed during third quarter  after the utility was denied its request to recover lost revenue from the irrigation load reduction program 
this amount compares to million in disallowed pca costs expensed during high wholesale energy prices and below normal water conditions had a negative effect on utility operations from to of the decrease from  per share is attributable to increases in power supply expenses absorbed by ipc and per share is due to the write off of amounts disallowed in ipc s pca 
additional increases in operating expenses for maintenance  depreciation  interest and customer expenses decreased earnings by approximately per share 
eps from energy marketing decreased per share in after increasing per share in in spite of a percent increase in settled electricity volume during  earnings decreased driven by a sharp decline in regional prices  price spreads and volatility  combined with the decreasing number of creditworthy counterparties 
in addition  the decision to wind down energy marketing and trading at ie has resulted in significantly reduced earnings from this segment 
compounding this decline in earnings is million of restructuring and other costs associated with the wind down of energy marketing 
the strong performance in was driven primarily by increased price volatility and regional price spreads and a percent increase in settled electricity sales volume 
combined eps from idacorp s other subsidiaries decreased in both and  primarily due to transactions at ida west 
in  ida west recorded an million impairment of its garnet fixed asset  reducing eps by 
in  ida west recorded a million gain on the sale of the hermiston power project  which contributed approximately per share 
utility operations this section discusses ipc s utility operations  which are subject to regulation by  among others  the state public utility commissions of idaho and oregon and by the ferc 
general business revenue the following table presents ipc s general business revenues and mwh sales for the last three years revenues mwh residential commercial industrial irrigation total as mentioned above  our general business revenue is dependent on many factors  including the number of customers we serve  the rates we charge  and weather conditions 
vs 
the following factors influenced the percent increase in general business revenue rate increases due to the annual pca resulted in increased revenues of approximately million 
the pca is discussed in more detail below in regulatory issues deferred power supply costs 
customer growth in ipc s service territory increased approximately two percent  resulting in a million increase in revenues 
in many irrigation customers participated in a program to decrease their usage 
this program was not in effect during  resulting in increased sales to irrigation customers of million 
fmc astaris  previously ipc s largest volume customer  closed its pocatello manufacturing plant late in however  based on a take or pay contract with fmc astaris which requires payment for power regardless of delivery  ipc will continue to receive payments from fmc astaris through march because of this  revenues from fmc astaris changed minimally  despite the significant decrease in mwh sold 
vs 
the following factors influenced the percent increase in general business revenue increased average rates  resulting from the pca  increased revenue million 
the pca is discussed in more detail below in regulatory issues deferred power supply costs 
a percent increase in general business customers increased revenue million 
conservation programs  including irrigation and large customer buybacks  and other usage factors  decreased energy consumption  reducing revenues million 
off system sales off system sales consist primarily of long term sales contracts and opportunity sales of surplus system energy 
off system sales mwh sold revenue per mwh vs 
in  off system sales decreased due to a percent decrease in volumes sold and a percent decrease in wholesale electricity prices 
vs 
off system sales decreased due principally to a percent decrease in volume sold  a result of poor hydro generating conditions 
the volume decrease was partially offset by an percent increase in price per mwh 
purchased power purchased power purchases load reduction costs mwh purchased purchases per mwh vs 
during  purchased power costs decreased primarily due to a percent reduction in average wholesale electricity prices 
load reduction payments also included in purchased power have decreased million due to expiration of the irrigation load reduction program and changes to the fmc astaris voluntary load reduction agreement 
see regulatory issues fmc astaris settlement agreement 
vs 
purchased power expenses increased in contributing to these results are a number of factors  including wholesale market conditions  and million of irrigation and fmc astaris load reduction program costs 
fuel expense the following table presents ipc s fuel expenses and generation at its thermal generating plants fuel expense thermal mwh generated cost per mwh vs 
fuel expenses during increased due to a nine percent increase in average coal prices partially offset by a four percent decrease in thermal generation 
vs 
fuel expenses increased in  despite decreased generation 
average coal prices increased  and the danskin mw gas fired plant went on line in september pca the pca expense component is related to ipc s pca regulatory mechanism 
in  actual power supply costs have exceeded those anticipated in the forecast 
below normal water conditions are still impacting power supply costs even though power supply prices are significantly lower than in  actual power supply costs were significantly greater than forecasted  resulting in a large pca credit  which is now being recovered in rates as revenues and the deferred balance is being amortized as pca expense 
fmc astaris and irrigation load reduction program cost deferrals also affect the pca 
the pca is discussed in more detail below in regulatory issues deferred power supply costs 
the following table presents the components of pca expense december  current year power supply cost deferral fmc astaris and irrigation program costs deferral amortization of prior year authorized balances write off of disallowed costs total power cost adjustment energy marketing idacorp announced on june  that ie would wind down its power marketing operations  stating that ie would not seek new electric customers  would limit its maximum value at risk to less than million  would target a reduction of working capital requirements to less than million by the end of  and would reduce its workforce at its boise operations by approximately percent 
on november   idacorp announced that it was terminating further evaluation of growth opportunities in the mid stream natural gas markets  and stated that ie would close its denver office by year end  and because of its link to the natural gas platform  would shut down its natural gas trading operation in houston by march the announcement concluded that ie s continued wind down of its energy marketing operations would result in additional workforce reductions at ie s boise operations through mid since the june  announcement  ie has reduced its workforce by over percent and will continue to reduce its workforce as contractual obligations terminate 
ie recorded a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of of million and additional charges related to exiting the business of million for a total of million 
for the year  the charges were million and relate to  among other matters  severance charges  non cancelable lease liabilities and asset impairments 
in connection with the wind down of energy marketing  matters have been identified that require resolution with the ferc or the ipuc 
one matter that required resolution with the ferc included the assignment of ipc s power marketing contracts to ie without obtaining the required prior approval of the ferc 
on february   the ferc issued an order approving the assignment of certain wholesale power and transmission services agreements from ipc to ie 
the ipuc matters include a proceeding that has been underway since may where ipc and the ipuc staff have been working to determine the appropriate compensation ie should provide to ipc as a result of transactions between the affiliates 
these matters are discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
ie reported a million operating loss in compared to million of operating income in gross margin for was million  which included million in unrealized losses related to the settlement  during  of outstanding positions at year end and the change in value of ie s forward positions at year end on a cumulative basis  ie anticipates that approximately percent of these unrealized forward positions recorded at year end will be settled by the end of  percent settled by the end of and percent settled by the end of all forward positions at december  should be settled within eight years 
changes in market conditions in future periods could substantially change the amounts of gain or loss ultimately realized upon settlement of the contracts 
revenues idacorp elected in third quarter to change its presentation of energy trading activities from gross to net presentation  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current presentation 
operating revenues include revenues from the sale of electricity and gas netted against the cost of purchased power and natural gas 
all financial transactions and unrealized income are presented on a net basis as operating revenue 
operating expenses include general and administrative expenses  bad debt reserves  transmission expenses and broker fees 
idacorp s net financial position and results of operations were not affected by this change in presentation 
the following table presents ie s energy marketing revenues and volumes for the last three years increase increase decrease decrease net operating revenues electricity gas total operating revenues operating volumes settled electricity mwh gas mmbtu the decline in revenues between and was driven by a sharp decline in regional prices  price spreads and volatility  combined with the decreasing number of creditworthy counterparties 
in addition  the decision to wind down energy marketing at ie has resulted in significantly reduced revenue from this segment 
ie s growth in revenue between and was due to an increase in wholesale electricity prices  electricity price volatility and growth in settled physical electricity volumes 
ie anticipates revenues in to continue to decline as ie continues to complete its obligations under existing contracts and wind down its business 
selling  general and administrative expenses total selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased million in due primarily to decreased allowance for bad debt and compensation expense 
allowance for bad debt decreased in due to unusually high bad debt expense in associated with reserves related to trading activities conducted with california entities in compensation expense has declined due to a reduction in profit related incentives and a reduction in workforce related to the wind down of operations 
sg a expense in increased million 
this was attributed to a rise in allowance for bad debt associated with reserves related to trading activities conducted with california entities in and an increase in compensation driven by an increase in the workforce and profit related incentives 
other income and expenses idacorp s other income loss decreased million as compared to the primary reasons for this decrease are an million partial write down on equipment related to the garnet project in fourth quarter at ida west and a million decrease attributed to early redemption of outstanding bonds held by ida west recognized as a gain in the early redemption of these outstanding bonds contributed to a million decrease in ida west s interest income 
ie recognized a million loss on property impairment related to the wind down of ie s energy marketing activities 
a million loss was recorded in by ipc related to its available for sale securities 
ipc s interest income decreased million due to the decreased pca balance as compared to other income decreased million in as compared to  due primarily to the sale in of ida west s interest in the hermiston power project  a mw  gas fired cogeneration project to be located near hermiston  oregon 
ida west was responsible for managing all permitting and development activities relating to the project since its inception in a pre tax gain of million was recorded on this transaction in this decrease was partially offset by a million gain recognized in related to the early redemption by the friant power authority of outstanding bonds held by ida west 
interest expense and other interest expense and other expense decreased million in and increased million in the decrease in is due primarily to reductions in variable interest rates and average outstanding debt 
the increase in is predominantly the result of higher short term debt balances to finance power purchased for ipc s system  partially offset by significant decreases in borrowing rates 
idacorp s average short term debt in was million  compared to million in tax accounting method change during the third quarter of  idacorp filed its federal income tax return and adopted a change to ipc s tax accounting method for capitalized overhead costs 
the former method allocated such costs primarily to construction of plant  while the new method allocates such costs to both construction of plant and the production of electricity 
the effect of the tax accounting method change has been recorded as a decrease to income tax expense for the year ended december  of million  of which million is attributable to and prior tax years  and million is attributable to the tax year 
the decrease to tax expense is a result of deductions on the applicable tax returns of costs that were capitalized into fixed assets for financial reporting purposes 
deferred income tax expense has not been provided because the prescribed regulatory accounting method does not allow for inclusion of such deferred tax expense in current rates 
regulated enterprises are required to recognize such adjustments as regulatory assets if it is probable that such amounts will be recovered from customers in future rates 
status of audit proceedings ipc settled income tax deficiencies related to its partnership investment in the bridger coal company  covering the years through the settlement resulted in deficiencies that were less than previously accrued  enabling ipc to decrease income tax expense by approximately million 
federal income tax returns for years through have been examined by the internal revenue service and substantially all issues have been settled 
management believes that adequate provision for income taxes has been made for the open years and after and for any unsettled issues prior to liquidity and capital resources operating cash flow idacorp s and ipc s operating cash flows in were million and million  respectively  driven by collections of outstanding pca amounts  reduced power supply costs and the receipt of tax refunds 
the increased cash flows were used to pay down short term debt and redeem ipc s auction rate preferred stock 
the tax refunds relate to net operating loss carrybacks associated with ipc s power supply costs and the tax accounting method change for capitalized overhead costs 
estimated tax payments offset these refunds 
contractual cash obligations the following table presents idacorp s total contractual cash obligations in the respective periods in which they are due thereafter ipc long term debt other long term debt ipc fuel supply contracts credit ratings on september   moody s changed its rating outlook for ipc to negative from stable 
moody s stated that the negative rating outlook reflects uncertainties relating to potential effects from the ferc related matters associated with the wind down of the energy marketing business at ie  certain affiliated transactions and the splitting of ie into a separate subsidiary 
access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality 
the following outlines the current s p  moody s and fitch ratings of idacorp s and ipc s securities standard and poor s moody s fitch ipc idacorp ipc idacorp ipc idacorp corporate credit rating a a a baa none none senior secured debt a none a none a none senior unsecured debt bbb bbb a baa a bbb preferred stock bbb bbb baa none bbb none trust preferred stock none bbb none baa none bbb commercial paper a a p p f f rating outlook positive positive negative negative stable stable these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agencies 
an explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency 
such ratings are not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change 
each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
some collateral agreements in place between ie and its counterparties include provisions requiring additional margining in the event of a credit rating downgrade 
in general  credit rating changes within the investment grade category should not materially impact the liquidity or financial condition of idacorp 
a credit downgrade below an investment grade rating could result in additional margin calls that could have a material negative impact on the liquidity of idacorp 
idacorp believes its existing credit facilities are adequate to fund these potential liquidity requirements 
working capital the significant changes in working capital that are not attributed to normal business activity and timing are discussed below 
due to the wind down of the energy marketing business  ie s customer receivables have decreased million  accounts payable have decreased million and other liabilities have decreased million 
the changes in regulatory assets current and derivative liabilities current are due to adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb derivative implementation group implementation issue c  normal purchases and normal sales exception for option type contracts and forward contracts in electricity 
this implementation issue allows contracts subject to book outs at electric utilities to qualify for the normal purchase and sales exception in sfas ipc completed an evaluation of its booked out contracts and determined that contracts previously classified as derivatives were exempt 
the increase in taxes accrued is primarily due to estimated taxes payable at year end  plus the receipt of million in cash refunds related to net operating loss carrybacks associated with ipc s power supply costs and ipc s tax accounting method change for capitalized overhead costs 
energy marketing assets and liabilities reflect the fair value of energy marketing contracts as of the reporting date 
the fair value of these contracts is unrealized and therefore does not necessarily indicate a current source or use of funds 
the decreases in the net energy marketing assets and liabilities from to are primarily a reflection of the wind down of the energy marketing business  significantly reducing the number of forward deals that remain part of the portfolio 
also contributing to the reduction are lower market prices at december  than in the prior year 
cash received from energy trading counterparties serves as collateral against open positions on energy related contracts and is reported in cash and cash equivalents 
the resultant liability is recorded as a reduction to the energy marketing asset generated by the open position 
regarding the use of posted collateral  the margining agreements provide the right to i sell  pledge  rehypothecate  assign  invest  use  commingle or otherwise dispose of  or otherwise use in its business any posted collateral it holds as long as idacorp maintains a credit rating of at least bbb s p or baa moody s 
idacorp has continued to maintain a credit rating above this minimum and has no restrictions on the use of collateral funds 
capital requirements idacorp capital expenditures are expected to total million from through this amount includes million for ipc construction expenditures  excluding allowance for funds used during construction afdc  million for ipc long term debt maturities and million for other ipc capital expenditures 
over the next three years internally generated cash and debt issuances are expected to provide the majority of the funds needed to meet idacorp s capital requirements

ipc s capital expenditures are primarily for maintaining current infrastructures and meeting anticipated electricity demands 
ifs s capital expenditures are primarily for additional investments in affordable housing projects 
the above table does not include idacorp s future investment relating to research and development at its fuel cell subsidiary  idatech 
based upon present environmental laws and regulations  ipc estimates its capital expenditures for environmental matters  excluding afdc  will total million 
studies and measures related to environmental concerns at ipc s hydro facilities account for million and investments in environmental equipment and facilities at the thermal plants account for million 
from through  environmental related capital expenditures  excluding afdc  are estimated to be million 
anticipated expenses related to ipc s hydro facilities account for million and thermal plant expenses are expected to total million 
various options that may be available to meet the future energy requirements of its customers include efficiency improvements on ipc s generation  transmission and distribution systems  purchased power and exchange agreements with other utilities or other power suppliers 
ipc will pursue the projects that best meet its future energy needs 
the above estimates are subject to constant revision in light of changing economic  regulatory and environmental factors and patterns of conservation

idacorp and ipc plan to renew their credit facilities that expire in march idacorp plans to replace its current million facility with a day facility  but at a reduced amount resulting from lower liquidity requirements at ie 
ipc plans to replace its current million facility with a similar sized facility 
short term financings at december   ipc s short term borrowing consisted of million of commercial paper  compared to million at december   consisting of million of floating rate notes and million of commercial paper 
the increase in was primarily a result of unrecovered power supply expenditures 
ipc repaid million of floating rate notes in september using short term borrowings from idacorp 
this million inter company debt was subsequently repaid with ipc first mortgage bonds issued in november at december   idacorp s short term borrowing totaled million  compared to million at december  long term financings idacorp currently has two shelf registration statements totaling million that can be used for the issuance of unsecured debt including medium term notes and preferred or common stock

legal and environmental issues legal and other proceedings california energy situation on july   the ferc issued an order establishing evidentiary hearing procedures related to the scope and methodology for calculating refunds related to transactions in the spot markets operated by the california independent system operator cal iso and the california power exchange calpx during the period october  through june  as to potential refunds  if any  ie believes its exposure is likely to be offset by amounts due from california entities 
multiple parties have filed requests for rehearing and petitions for review 
the latter more than have been consolidated by the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit and held in abeyance while the ferc continues its deliberations 
the ninth circuit also directed the ferc to permit the parties to adduce additional evidence respecting market manipulation and although the california parties the california attorney general  other state agencies and the california investor owned utilities have requested specific procedures to implement that requirement  the ferc has not yet acted on that request 
on november   the ferc issued an order allowing the parties to the california refund proceeding to conduct discovery for one hundred days into market manipulation by various sellers during the western power crises of and at the conclusion of the discovery period parties alleging market manipulation are to submit their claims to the ferc and parties have until march  to submit evidence or comments in response  including assertions that cross examination is warranted 
on march   a group of california parties  including the california attorney general  the california public utilities commission  the california electricity oversight board  sce and pg e  filed materials with the ferc claiming that wholesale power suppliers manipulated the california market during they seek approximately billion in refunds for the state s ratepayers 
a number of wholesale power suppliers were named in the filings  including idacorp and ipc

overton  a nevada electric improvement district  based on overton s breach of its power contracts with ie 
the july contract provided for overton to purchase mw of electrical energy per hour from ie at per mwh  from july  through june  in the contract  overton agreed to raise its rates to its customers to the extent necessary to make its payment obligations to ie under the contract 
ie has asked the idaho district court for damages pursuant to the contract  for a declaration that overton is not entitled to renegotiate or terminate the contract and for injunctive relief requiring overton to raise rates as stipulated in the contract 
overton filed an answer and counterclaim claiming  among other things  that ie breached the agreement by failing to perform in accordance with its contractual obligation and asking for damages in the amount to be proved at trial 
overton also asserts that the contract is unenforceable or subject to rescission 
ie believes overton s assertions are without merit 
ie and overton filed cross motions for summary judgment that have been denied by the court 
the parties continue with discovery in the lawsuit 
trial is scheduled to commence on may  ie believes that overton s actions constitute a breach of the contract and intends to vigorously prosecute this lawsuit 
while the outcome of litigation is never certain and ie has not yet completed discovery  ie continues to believe that it should prevail on the merits 
at december   ie had a million long term asset related to the overton claim 
ie will review the recoverability of the asset on an ongoing basis 
the recoverability of the asset is subject to overton s willingness and ability to raise its rates as provided for in the contract

ferc investigations regarding trading practices in a series of requests for information ending on may  the ferc issued a data request to all sellers of wholesale electricity and or ancillary services to the cal iso and or the calpx during the years the request required ipc and ie to respond in the form of an affidavit to inquiries respecting various trading practices that the ferc identified in its fact finding investigation of potential manipulation of electric and natural gas prices in docket no 
pa ipc and ie filed the various responses sought by the ferc 
the may response indicated that although they did export energy from the calpx outside of california during the period  they did not engage in any impermissible trading practice described in the enron memoranda and identified by the ferc 
the energy purchased within and exported out of california was resold to supply preexisting load obligations  to supply preexisting term transactions or to supply a contemporaneous sales transaction 
the companies denied engaging in the other ten practices identified by the ferc 
ipc and ie filed additional responses with the ferc on may and june  in the may response  the companies denied engaging in the practice referred to as wash  round trip or sell buyback trading involving the sale of an electricity product to another company together with a simultaneous purchase of the same product at the same price 
in the june response  where the data request was directed to all sellers of natural gas in the western systems coordinating council and or texas during the years  the companies denied engaging in the practice referred to as wash  round trip or sell buyback trading involving the sale of natural gas together with a simultaneous purchase of the same product at the same price 
us commodity futures trading commission investigations regarding trading practices on october   the us commodity futures trading commission cftc issued a subpoena to ipc requesting  among other things  all records related to all natural gas and electricity trades by ipc involving round trip trades  also known as wash trades or sell buyback trades including  but not limited to those made outside the western systems coordinating council region 
the subpoena applies to both ie and ipc 
as discussed above  on may   both ie and ipc responded to a similar request from the ferc stating that they did not engage in round trip or wash trades 
by letter from the cftc dated october   the division of enforcement agreed to hold in abeyance until a later date all items requested in the subpoena with the exception of one paragraph which related to three trades on a certain date with a specific party 
the companies provided the requested information 
on january   ipc received a request from the cftc  pursuant to the october subpoena  for documents related to round trip or wash trades and information supplied to energy industry publications 
the request applies to both ipc and ie 
the companies stated in their response to the cftc that they did not engage in any round trip or wash trade transactions and that they believe the only information provided to energy industry publications was actual transaction data

environmental issues salmon recovery plan ipc is continuing to monitor regional efforts to develop a comprehensive and scientifically credible plan to ensure the long term survival of anadromous fish runs on the columbia and lower snake rivers 
in november of  the national marine fisheries service nmfs listed the snake river sockeye salmon as endangered under the endangered species act esa 
subsequently  in april  nmfs listed the snake river fall chinook and the snake river spring summer chinook as threatened under the esa 
only the snake river fall chinook inhabit the snake river in the vicinity of ipc s three dam hells canyon complex hcc 
these listings have not had any major effects on ipc s operations 
in  ipc voluntarily initiated a fall chinook interim recovery plan and study intended to address concerns relative to fall chinook spawning immediately below hells canyon dam 
since the inception of that plan  ipc has been managing releases from the hcc during the fall chinook spawning season to provide stable conditions for spawning fall chinook below hells canyon dam 
these conditions are maintained through fry emergence in the spring 
in connection with the relicensing of the hcc  ipc is engaged in ongoing discussions with the ferc and nmfs relative to esa issues associated with the hcc 
in december  nmfs issued a final biological opinion biop on the operation of the federal columbia river power system fcrps 
this biop resulted from esa section consultation on the operations of the federal projects operated by the us army corps of engineers and us bureau of reclamation bor on the lower snake and columbia rivers 
it did not relate to the operations of ipc s hcc and did not call for any changes in the operations of the hcc 
in may of  nmfs issued a final biop on the operations of the bor projects in the snake river basin above the hcc 
this biop was interim in nature  expiring in march nmfs and the bor are currently negotiating an extension of this biop for subsequent years operations 
portions of the fcrps biop and the bor biop provide for the acquisition of water from idaho by the bor in order to provide augmentation flows to assist with the downstream migration of esa listed anadromous fish through the lower snake river fcrps projects 
for the past several years  the bor has been leasing water from willing lessors in idaho in an effort to provide the augmentation flows 
in connection with these flow augmentation efforts  ipc has been cooperating with the federal agencies by moving and shaping water acquired by the bor through the hcc 
in the past  ipc has been reimbursed for any energy losses incurred as a result of this cooperation through an agreement with the bonneville power administration bpa 
while this agreement expired in april of  ipc has advised federal interests of its willingness to continue to assist with the movement and shaping of federal flow augmentation water provided any adverse impact to its customers is satisfactorily addressed 
the federal interests determined not to reimburse ipc and ipc did not assist with the movement and shaping of federal flow augmentation water during or threatened and endangered snails in december  the us fish and wildlife service usfws listed five species of snails that inhabit the middle snake river as threatened or endangered species under the esa 
in  in preparation for the ferc relicensing of certain of ipc s hydropower projects  ipc obtained a permit from the usfws to study the listed snails 
since that date  ipc has been collecting field data and conducting studies in an effort to determine the status of the listed snails and how they may be affected by a variety of factors  including hydropower production  water quality and irrigation practices 
ipc is currently involved in renewing five federal licenses for hydroelectric projects in the middle snake river region 
those projects include the upper salmon falls  lower salmon falls  bliss  shoshone falls collectively called the mid snake projects and the c 
j 
strike projects 
the potential impact of the operation of these projects on the five esa listed snails has raised some issues in the relicensing processes before the ferc 
section of the esa requires that the ferc consult with the usfws on any proposed federal action  such as the relicensing of ipc s projects  that may affect a species listed as threatened or endangered under the esa 
on january   the ferc requested that the usfws engage in section consultation on the proposed relicensing of the mid snake projects with regard to the esa listed snails 
if the ferc determines that operation of ipc s mid snake projects adversely affects a listed snail  they may impose operating constraints that could result in loss of peaking capacity at the projects 
the cost of replacing this peaking capacity will vary depending upon market conditions and the replacement option selected 
based upon the studies initiated by ipc in  in july and october of ipc  in cooperation with the state of idaho  filed petitions with the usfws to remove the bliss rapids snail and idaho springsnail from the federal list of threatened and endangered wildlife 
because of the pending relicensing proceedings at the ferc and the esa consultation between the ferc and usfws on the potential effect of project operations on esa listed snails  ipc submitted the petitions  and the studies upon which they were based  to the ferc for inclusion in the mid snake and c j strike relicensing proceedings 
on december   because of inconsistencies discovered in field data collected by ipc since  the macro invertebrate database into which the field data was entered and the use of that database in the preparation of the studies used to support the pending petitions  ipc notified the usfws and the ferc that it was withdrawing the petitions 
ipc has retained an independent scientist to review the procedures used to collect the field data  the creation of the database  the database itself and its use in preparing the snail studies 
ipc has advised the ferc that it expects this independent review will be completed by march  and has asked that the ferc withhold any action on the pending esa section consultation until the independent review is complete 
the usfws has also requested that the consultation be extended until the completion of the independent review process 
environmental regulation costs ipc anticipates million in annual operating costs for environmental facilities during hydro facility expenses account for million of this total and million is related to thermal plant operating expenses 
from through  total environmental related operating costs are estimated to be million 
anticipated expenses related to the hydro facilities account for million and thermal plant expenses are expected to total million during this period 
regulatory issues deferred power supply costs ipc s deferred power supply costs consist of the following at december  and oregon deferral idaho pca current year power supply cost deferrals deferral for rate year deferral for rate year irrigation load reduction program astaris load reduction agreement idaho pca true up awaiting recovery irrigation and small general service deferral for recovery in the rate year industrial customer deferral for recovery in the rate year remaining true up authorized october remaining true up authorized may remaining true up authorized may total deferral idaho ipc has a pca mechanism that provides for annual adjustments to the rates charged to its idaho retail customers 
these adjustments  which take effect in may  are based on forecasts of net power supply expenses and the true up of the prior year s forecast 
during the year  percent of the difference between the actual and forecasted costs is deferred with interest 
the ending balance of this deferral  called a true up  is then included in the calculation of the next year s pca adjustment 
so far in the pca rate year  actual power supply costs have exceeded those anticipated in the forecast 
below normal water conditions are still impacting power supply costs even though power supply prices are significantly lower 
in addition  an irrigation load reduction program was completed in the pca rate year and the fmc astaris voluntary load reduction costs have decreased  both reducing the pca regulatory account balance from million as of december  to million as of december  on may   the ipuc issued order no 
related to the pca rate filing 
the order granted recovery of million of excess power supply costs  consisting of million of voluntary load reduction and power supply costs incurred between march  and march  million of excess power supply costs forecasted for the period april through march million of unamortized costs previously approved for recovery beginning october  the amount authorized in october totaled million 
this order spreads the remaining october rate increase  which would have ended in september  through may the order also denied recovery of million of lost revenues resulting from the irrigation load reduction program  and million of other costs ipc sought to recover 
deferred recovery of million of costs related to irrigation and small general service customers 
in june  the ipuc issued order no 
deferring an additional million applicable to certain industrial customers 
the million will be recovered during the pca rate year  and ipc will earn a six percent carrying charge on the balance 
denied ipc s request to issue million in energy cost recovery bonds  which would have spread the recovery of that amount over three years 
discontinued the ipuc required three tiered rate structure for residential customers 
authorized a separate surcharge to collect approximately million annually to fund future conservation programs 
the ipuc had previously issued order no 
on april  disallowing the lost revenue portion of the irrigation load reduction program 
ipc believes that the ipuc s order is inconsistent with order no 
 dated may   that allowed recovery of such costs  and ipc filed a petition for reconsideration on may  on august   the ipuc issued order no 
denying the petition for reconsideration 
as a result of this order  approximately million was expensed in september ipc still believes it should be entitled to receive recovery of this amount and has asked the idaho supreme court to review the ipuc s decision 
if successful  ipc would record any amount recovered as revenue 
in the may pca filing  ipc requested recovery of million of power supply costs 
the ipuc subsequently issued order no 
authorizing recovery of million  but deferring recovery of million pending further review 
the approved amount resulted in an average rate increase of percent 
after conducting hearings on the remaining million  the ipuc in order no 
authorized recovery of million plus million of accrued interest  beginning in october the remaining million not recovered in rates from the pca filing was written off in september in october  ipc filed an application with the ipuc for an order approving inclusion in the pca of costs incurred for the irrigation load reduction program and the fmc astaris load reduction agreement 
these two programs were implemented in to reduce demand and were approved by the ipuc and the opuc 
the costs incurred in for these two programs were million for the irrigation load reduction program and million for the fmc astaris load reduction agreement 
the ipuc subsequently issued order no 
authorizing ipc to include direct costs it has accrued in the programs  subject to later adjustments in the pca year 
as mentioned earlier  the ipuc also denied ipc s request to recover lost revenues experienced from the irrigation load reduction program 
the may pca rate adjustment increased idaho general business customer rates by percent  and resulted from forecasted below average hydroelectric generating conditions 
overall  the pca adjustment increased general business revenue by approximately million during the rate period 
oregon ipc also filed applications with the opuc to recover calendar year extraordinary power supply costs applicable to the oregon jurisdiction 
in two separate orders  the opuc approved rate increases totaling six percent  which is the maximum annual rate of recovery allowed under oregon state law 
these increases are recovering approximately million annually 
the oregon deferred balance is million as of december fmc astaris settlement agreement on january   the ipuc initiated an investigation to examine the load reduction rates contained in the voluntary load reduction vlr agreement between ipc and fmc astaris 
this vlr agreement amended the electric service agreement esa that governed the delivery of electric service to fmc astaris pocatello plant  which ceased operations late in on june   ipc and fmc astaris signed and filed a proposed stipulation and settlement agreement agreement with the ipuc and on june   the ipuc approved the agreement in order no 
which included the following provisions the vlr payments that ipc would have made to fmc astaris through may were decreased million  reducing ipc s overall payments to million 
approximately percent of this reduction will flow through the pca mechanism as a reduction in costs to idaho retail customers 
fmc astaris dismissed  with prejudice  a declaratory judgment action concerning the fmc astaris contract that it had previously filed against ipc in the fourth judicial district for the state of idaho 
fmc astaris will pay ipc approximately million through march to settle the esa 
ipc s need to purchase power from the wholesale markets decreased during due to the ceased operation of fmc astaris pocatello plant and settlement of the above mentioned esa 
garnet power purchase agreement ipc and garnet energy llc garnet  a wholly owned subsidiary of ida west  entered into a power purchase agreement ppa on december  for ipc to purchase energy produced by garnet s proposed natural gas generation facility 
ipc filed an application with the ipuc for an order approving the ppa and an accounting order authorizing the inclusion in the pca of power supply expenses associated with the purchase of capacity and energy from garnet 
prior to the actual hearing date  garnet informed ipc that there was a substantial likelihood that it would be unable to obtain the financing at acceptable terms necessary to construct the facility 
on july   the ipuc closed the proceeding involving ipc s petition to enter into a ppa with garnet and directed ipc to return in days with a report on the status of garnet s progress in obtaining financing for the project and how ipc proposed to meet future power requirements if the garnet facility is not built 
on october   ipc submitted its compliance report to the ipuc  which included ida west s notification that due to dramatic changes in the electricity industry  financing the project on acceptable terms under the ppa was impracticable  ida west s offering of three alternatives to allow the project to go forward and ipc s revised plan for meeting future load requirements absent the ppa associated with the garnet project  including wholesale power purchases  energy exchanges  obtaining certain transmission rights  or constructing or acquiring generation resources located in ipc s service territory 
following the ipuc s acceptance of the irp see below  ipc continues to work on identifying and securing resources necessary to meet future power requirements 
the original garnet ppa was mutually terminated on march   however  the site remains viable as a future generation development 
ida west had capitalized million related to the garnet project as of third quarter during fourth quarter  ida west recorded an million partial write down of its investment in equipment for this project 
this partial write down reflects the drop in prices for and increased availability of generating equipment due to the collapse of the merchant power plant development business 
integrated resource plan every two years  ipc is required to file with the ipuc and opuc an irp  a comprehensive look at ipc s present and future demands for electricity and plans for meeting that demand 
the irp identified the need for additional resources to address potential electricity shortfalls within ipc s utility service territory by mid the new resources expected to be in place at that time were the previously identified mw power purchase from the garnet project  an additional mw generation resource to be determined and a mw transmission upgrade to increase import capability 
these resources would be used to satisfy energy demand during ipc s peak periods 
prior to  ipc will continue to use purchases from the energy markets as necessary to meet short term energy needs 
the ipuc staff and several other interested parties filed comments responding to ipc s proposed irp 
the comments urge the ipuc not to acknowledge the irp until the garnet issue is resolved  and ipc provides additional detail on potential conservation measures that could be implemented 
ipc filed reply comments on october  addressing those issues 
the above mentioned garnet compliance report  submitted to the ipuc on october   was included in those reply comments by reference 
on february   the ipuc issued order no 
 which accepted and acknowledged ipc s irp as modified and directed ipc to implement certain changes in its irp related to both the public process and the evaluation of demand side options 
the accepted irp indicated the purchase of mw from the wholesale market for ipc s retail customers during june  july  november and december 
on february   ipc issued a formal rfp seeking bids for the construction of up to mw of additional generation to support the growing seasonal demand for electricity in ipc s service area 
notice of an intent to bid must be submitted to ipc by march  automatic meter reading on february   the ipuc issued order no 
which directed ipc to submit a plan no later than march  to replace its existing meters with advanced meters that are capable of both automated meter reading amr and time of use pricing 
in its order  the ipuc indicated that implementation of amr meters should begin in and be completed in ipc has estimated it would cost approximately million to install advanced meters with amr capability 
ipc intends to file a petition for reconsideration of the ipuc s order and to request a stay of the requirement to file the march  plan 
nevada jurisdiction in  the ipuc and the public utilities commission of nevada approved ipc s sale of its nevada service territory to raft river electric co op raft river 
this sale transferred the distribution facilities and rights of way that serve about  customers in northern nevada and about customers in southern idaho 
the ferc approved a power supply agreement between ipc and raft river 
relicensing of hydroelectric projects ipc  like other utilities that operate nonfederal hydroelectric projects  obtains licenses for its hydroelectric projects from the ferc 
these licenses generally last for to years depending on the size and complexity of the project 
currently  the licenses for five hydro projects have expired 
these projects continue to operate under annual licenses until the ferc issues a new permanent license 
three more hydro project licenses will expire by ipc is actively pursuing the relicensing of these projects  a process that may continue for the next to years 
ipc has filed applications seeking renewal of licenses for the bliss  upper salmon falls  lower salmon falls  cj strike  shoshone falls and upper and lower malad hydroelectric projects 
the licenses for the hells canyon complex brownlee  oxbow and hells canyon and the swan falls project expire in and  respectively 
ipc is currently engaged in procedures necessary to file timely license applications for these projects 
although various federal and state requirements and issues must be resolved through the license renewal process  ipc anticipates that it will relicense each of the eight projects 
final environmental impact statements eis have been issued for the bliss  upper salmon falls  lower salmon falls and shoshone falls projects 
new ferc licenses are anticipated in while the actual costs of protection  mitigation and enhancement pm e measures and other costs associated with the relicensing of the projects will not be known until the new license is issued by the ferc  costs associated with these licenses assuming year licenses are expected to total approximately million during the first five years of the licenses and million over the following years 
a final eis has been issued for the cj strike project and a new ferc license is expected in while the actual costs of pm e measures and other costs associated with the relicensing of the project will not be known until the new license is issued by the ferc  costs associated with the license assuming a year license are expected to total approximately million during the first five years of the license and million over the following years 
the four mid snake river projects  bliss  upper salmon falls  lower salmon falls and shoshone falls  and the cj strike projects  may affect five species of snails listed under the endangered species act 
see previous discussion in legal and environmental issues environmental issues threatened and endangered snails 
the upper and lower malad project license expires in july and the new license application was filed in july the application is proceeding through the normal ferc licensing process 
the application includes proposed pm e measures estimated to total assuming a year license approximately million during the first five years of the license and million over the following years 
however  the actual costs of pm e measures and other costs associated with the relicensing of the project will not be known until the new license is issued by the ferc 
the most significant relicensing effort is the hells canyon complex  which provides percent of ipc s hydro generation capacity and percent of its total generating capacity 
ipc developed its draft license application with the assistance of a collaborative team made up of individuals representing state and federal agencies  businesses  environmental  tribal  customer  local government and local landowner interests 
the draft license application was issued in september and the final application will be filed in july the draft application includes proposed pm e measures estimated to total approximately assuming a year license million during the first five years of the license and million during the following years 
however  the actual costs of pm e measures and other costs associated with the relicensing of the project will not be known until the new license is issued by the ferc 
at december   million of pre relicensing costs were included in construction work in progress cwip and million of pre relicensing costs were included in electric plant in service 
the pre relicensing costs are recorded and held in cwip until a new permanent license or annual license is issued by the ferc  at which time the charges are transferred to electric plant in service 
pre relicensing costs as well as costs related to the new licenses  as referenced above  will be submitted to regulators for recovery through the rate making process 
regional transmission organizations in december  the ferc  in its landmark order no 
 said that all companies with transmission assets must file to form regional transmission organizations rtos or explain why they cannot 
order no 
is a follow up to order nos 
and issued in  which required transmission owners to provide non discriminatory transmission service to third parties 
by encouraging the formation of rtos  the ferc seeks to further facilitate the formation of efficient  competitive wholesale electricity markets 
in october and march  in response to ferc order no 
 ipc and other regional transmission owners filed stage one and stage two plans to form rto west  an entity that will operate the transmission grid in seven western states 
rto west will have its own independent governing board 
the participating transmission owners will retain ownership of the lines  but will not have a role in operating the grid 
these ferc filings represent a portion of the filing necessary to form rto west 
however  substantial additional filings will be necessary to include the tariff and integration agreements associated with the new entity 
state approvals also need to be obtained 
in september  the ferc issued an order granting in part rto west s stage two request for a declaratory order  approving with modification the majority of the proposed plan for development of a rto by ten utilities in the northwest and canada and the bpa 
ipc is one of the filing utilities 
with further development of detail and some modification  the ferc stated that the proposal will satisfy not only the order no 
requirements  but can also provide a basic framework for standard market design for the west 
further development of the rto west proposal by the filing utilities continues 
in july  the ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nopr on standard market design for regulated utilities 
if implemented as proposed  the nopr will substantially change how wholesale markets operate throughout the united states 
the proposed rulemaking expands the ferc s intent to unbundle transmission operations from integrated utilities and ensure robust competition in wholesale markets 
the proposed rule contemplates that all wholesale and retail customers will be on a single network transmission service tariff 
the proposed rule also contemplates the implementation of a bid based system for buying and selling energy in wholesale markets to manage congestion 
the market would be administered by rtos  or independent transmission providers 
rtos would also be responsible for putting together regional plans that identify opportunities to construct new transmission  generation or demand side programs to reduce transmission constraints and meet regional energy requirements 
finally  the proposed rule envisions the development of regional market monitors responsible for ensuring that individual participants do not exercise unlawful market power 
comments to the proposed rules were due during the last months of and additional comments are due the first part of the ferc currently anticipates that the final rules will be in place in mid and the contemplated market changes will take place in and other matters new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
an obligation may result from the acquisition  construction  development and the normal operation of a long lived asset 
sfas requires an entity to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation aro in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity increases the carrying amount of the related long lived asset to reflect the future retirement cost 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value and paid  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
if at the end of the asset s life the recorded liability differs from the actual obligations paid  a gain or loss would be recognized at that time 
as a rate regulated entity  ipc expects to record regulatory assets and liabilities instead of accretion  depreciation and gains or losses  if the criteria for such treatment are met 
sfas is effective beginning in a detailed assessment of the applicability and implications of sfas has been performed 
aros related to ipc s three jointly owned coal fired generation facilities  its transmission and distribution facilities and the bridger coal mine  which is owned by an equity method investee have been identified 
when adopted in  ipc expects to record aro liabilities of million and fixed assets of million  with the offset to regulatory assets 
these amounts do not include an amount for the transmission and distribution facilities  because  based on the indeterminate life of these assets  an aro calculation cannot be made 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred  rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing or other exit or disposal activity 
this standard supersedes eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on idacorp or ipc s financial statements 
eitf issue no 
 issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  reached a consensus to rescind eitf  the impact of which is to preclude mark to market accounting for all energy trading contracts not within the scope of sfas the consensus regarding the rescission of eitf is applicable for fiscal periods beginning after december  energy trading contracts not within the scope of sfas that are purchased after october   but prior to the implementation of the consensus  are not permitted to apply mark to market accounting 
in addition  effective on january   all energy trading contracts previously accounted for at fair value under eitf must be adjusted to historical cost unless those contracts meet the definition of a derivative under sfas this adjustment will be recorded as a cumulative effect of adoption of a new accounting principle 
the rescission of eitf will not have a material effect on idacorp or ipc s financial statements  as substantially all of their energy trading contracts meet the definition of a derivative under sfas eitf also reached a consensus that gains and losses on derivative instruments within the scope of sfas should be shown net in the income statement if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes 
in anticipation of this requirement  idacorp has elected to change its presentation of energy trading activities from gross to net presentation  in accordance with the option allowed under eitf prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current presentation 
therefore operating revenues for the energy marketing segment include revenues from the sale of electricity and gas netted against the cost of purchased power and natural gas 
additionally  all financial transactions and unrealized income are presented on a net basis as operating revenue 
operating expenses include general and administrative expenses  bad debt reserves  transmission expenses and broker fees 
the net financial position and results of operations of idacorp were not affected by this change in presentation 
in november the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements in this interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the adoption of this interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on idacorp and ipc s financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or in which equity investors do not bear the residual economic risks 
the interpretation applies to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that was acquired before february  idacorp and ipc have determined that it is not reasonably possible that they will be required to consolidate or disclose information about a variable interest entity upon the effective date of this interpretation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk idacorp and ipc are exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  changes in certain commodity prices  credit risk and equity price risk 
the following discussion summarizes these risks and the financial instruments  derivative instruments and derivative commodity instruments sensitive to changes in interest rates  commodity prices and equity prices that were held at december  interest rate risk idacorp and ipc are exposed to changes in interest rates through the issuance of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
the following table summarizes the carrying amount and interest rates by expected maturity date of debt obligations at december  in thousands of dollars fair value at december thereafter total idacorp  inc short term debt fixed rate debt average interest rate long term debt variable rate debt average interest rate fixed rate debt average interest rate idaho power company short term debt fixed rate debt average interest rate long term debt variable rate debt average interest rate fixed rate debt average interest rate the majority of debt is held in fixed rate securities with embedded call options 
by nature  the market value of variable rate debt is not sensitive to changes in interest rates  and short term borrowings do not give rise to significant interest rate risk because they generally have maturities of less than three months 
commodity price risk utility ipc is exposed to changes in commodity prices related to the purchases and sales of electricity as part of its ongoing utility operations 
ipc is exposed to this risk to the extent that a portion of the electric energy it is required to sell to its customers at fixed rates may be purchased at wholesale electric market prices  which can be higher than the fixed sales rate received 
ipc s exposure to this risk is offset to some extent by the previously discussed pca mechanism in place in idaho 
the objective of ipc s market price risk management program is to mitigate the risk associated with the purchase and sale of electricity  while balancing this risk against system reliability and cost considerations 
ipc has adopted a risk management policy to address commodity price risk 
the risk management committee rmc  comprised of ipc officers and other senior staff  oversees the risk management program 
on a regular basis  the rmc reviews multiple system resource and load projections and evaluates the potential impacts of changes in four key variables  wholesale prices  system loads  system resources and streamflow conditions 
the rmc controls the risk by assessing the impact of changes in the variables on power supply cost and projected volumetric surplus and deficit data  and by reviewing forward price curves for electricity and gas 
the rmc then orders an appropriate risk mitigating action 
actions may be undertaken only with creditworthy counterparties 
on august   due to the wind down of energy marketing  all utility related wholesale energy and gas transaction processes were returned to ipc 
these activities are focused on meeting system requirements and capitalizing on system related opportunities that can be risk managed 
energy trading ie buys and sells financial and physical natural gas and electricity commodity contracts as part of its business  exposing ie to electricity and natural gas commodity price risk as well as interest rate risk 
ie has a risk management policy defining the limits within which it contains its commodity price risk 
ie trades commodity futures  forwards  options and swaps as a method of managing the commodity price risk and optimizing the profitability of its electricity and natural gas trading 
ie also transacts in interest rate futures and swaps to manage the interest rate risk embedded in its commodity portfolio 
when buying and selling energy  the volatility of energy prices can have a significant negative impact on profitability if not appropriately managed 
also  counterparty creditworthiness is key to ensuring that transactions entered into can withstand potentially dramatic market fluctuations 
to manage the risks inherent in the energy commodity industry  ie s rmc  comprised of idacorp and ie officers  oversees ie s risk management program as defined in the risk management policy 
the objective of ie s risk management program is to manage the risk associated with the purchase and sale of natural gas and electricity within levels established by the rmc 
ie s policy also allows the use of these commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes in support of its operations 
the value at risk var measure is a tool used by ie s rmc to understand on a daily basis the potential impact on earnings arising from changes in market prices 
the december   var for energy marketing operations is approximately million at both a and percent confidence level and for a holding period of one business day 
the average var for at a percent confidence level and one day holding period was million 
the var was calculated using an analytic var methodology 
this methodology computes var based upon positions and forward market prices as of december   and historical forward price volatility and correlation 
the var is understood to be a forecast and is not guaranteed to occur 
the percent confidence level and one day holding period imply that there is a five percent chance that the daily loss will exceed approximately million 
the percent confidence level implies a one percent chance that daily loss will exceed million 
the var calculation is principally affected by market prices and volatility of prices 
the rmc actively manages the risk to keep ie s trading activities within trading limits 
credit risk utility ipc is subject to credit risk based on its activity with market counterparties 
ipc is exposed to this risk to the extent that a counterparty may fail to fulfill a contractual obligation to provide energy  purchase energy  or complete financial settlement for market activities 
ipc mitigates this exposure by actively establishing credit limits  measuring  monitoring  reporting  using appropriate contractual arrangements and transferring of credit risk through the use of financial guarantees  cash or letters of credit 
a current list of acceptable counterparties and credit limits is maintained 
energy trading ie is exposed to counterparty credit risk as part of its energy trading business 
this risk is defined as exposure to decreases in expected earnings or cash flow when a counterparty to an energy commodity contract cannot or will not pay or deliver 
to manage counterparty credit risk within acceptable levels  the rmc has established credit risk limits for each counterparty 
credit risk exposure is measured and reported daily to members of the rmc 
in order to provide further protection from a counterparty s deteriorating creditworthiness  ie utilizes industry standard agreements containing various protective creditworthiness provisions 
other tools used to manage credit risk are the holding of collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit and the use of margining agreements with counterparties when credit risk exceeds certain pre determined thresholds 
because of the volatile nature of energy market prices  margining agreements can require the posting of large amounts of cash between counterparties to hold as collateral against the value of the energy contracts 
this practice mitigates credit risk but increases the need for cash or other liquid securities to ensure the ability to meet all margin requirements when the markets are most volatile 
at year end  percent of the credit exposure related to ie s unrealized positions was with investment grade counterparties 
two percent was with non investment grade counterparties and the remaining percent was with non rated counterparties 
the majority of the non rated entities are municipalities  public utility districts and electric cooperatives 
nearly percent of ie s total credit exposure is to one investment grade counterparty under a contract with less than two years remaining 
the following table presents the maturity of credit risk exposure for energy marketing at december less than more than years years years total investment grade non investment grade no external ratings total equity price risk idacorp and ipc are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets  primarily through their pension plan assets  a mine reclamation trust fund owned by an equity method investment of ipc  and other equity investments at ipc 
a hypothetical ten percent decrease in equity prices would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of financial instruments that are classified as available for sale securities
