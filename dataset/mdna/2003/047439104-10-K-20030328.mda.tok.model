item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
in this report  atherogenics  we  us and our refer to atherogenics  inc overview since our operations began in  we have focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel drugs for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases  such as atherosclerosis  rheumatoid arthritis and asthma 
based on our proprietary vascular protectant  or v protectant  technology platform  we have advanced three drug candidates into development  agi  agix and agi  and are progressing on a number of other pre clinical programs 
to date  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development 
we have not derived any commercial revenues from product sales and  excluding the effect of certain license fees of a non recurring nature  expect to incur significant losses in most years prior to deriving any product revenue 
we have incurred significant losses since we began operations and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
we cannot assure you whether or when we will become profitable 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses over the next several years as we continue to incur increasing research and development costs 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that these fluctuations may be substantial 
our ability to achieve profitability depends upon our ability  alone or with others  to complete the successful development of our product candidates  to obtain required regulatory clearances  and to manufacture and market our future products 
in october  we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with schering plough corporation covering our lead compound  agi under terms of the agreement  schering plough obtained exclusive worldwide rights to agi and related compounds 
schering plough was responsible for all costs of development and commercialization and paid us an initial licensing fee 
in october  we reacquired all rights to agi and related technology and terminated the license agreement 
in june  we entered into a worldwide exclusive license agreement with national jewish medical and research center of denver  colorado to discover and develop novel therapeutics based on mek kinases  enzymes that participate in a broad range of cellular activities  and related technology for the treatment of inflammation 
we expect these new technologies to provide a second broad platform for the discovery and development of a new class of anti inflammatory drug candidates 
critical accounting policies we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
use of estimates the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition license fees  which are nonrefundable  are recognized when the related license agreements specify that no further efforts or obligations are required of atherogenics 
atherogenics had committed to perform certain research and development activities as part of a license agreement  which has been terminated  accordingly  the upfront license payment was amortized over the anticipated time period to conduct these activities 
revenues under research and development arrangements were recognized as the research and development activities were performed pursuant to the terms of the related agreements 
these revenues were billed quarterly and the related payments were not refundable 
revenues that had not been invoiced were reflected as unbilled receivables 

table of contents stock based compensation atherogenics has elected to follow accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  in accounting for its stock based employee compensation plans  rather than the alternative fair value accounting method provided for under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as sfas requires the use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
atherogenics accounts for transactions in which services are received in exchange for equity instruments based on the fair value of such services received from non employees  in accordance with sfas and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
in connection with the grant of certain options to employees  atherogenics recorded non cash deferred stock compensation of approximately million since  representing the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of atherogenics common stock on the dates these stock options were granted 
deferred stock compensation is included as a reduction of shareholders equity and is being amortized to expense using the graded vesting method 
the graded vesting method provides for vesting of each portion of the overall award over its respective vesting period  and results in higher vesting in earlier years than straight line vesting 
in connection with the grant of certain options and warrants to non employees during and  atherogenics recorded non cash deferred stock compensation of approximately million 
the fair value of the options and warrants for purposes of this calculation was determined by using the black scholes option valuation model 
the fair value of the options and warrants is re measured at each measurement date 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues there were no revenues during  compared to million in last year s revenue reflected the amortization of a million license fee payment and research and development revenue attributable to a license agreement that was terminated in october expenses research and development 
research and development expenses  excluding amortization of deferred stock compensation  were million in  compared to million in the increase of million  or  is primarily due to increased expenditures for the phase ii clinical trials for agi and agix for items such as patient costs and clinical drug supply 
also contributing to the increase are start up expenditures related to organizing the arise phase iii clinical trial  which are primarily related to commercial formulation  manufacturing bulk drug supply and the hiring of additional employees in preparation for the planned clinical trials

in  amortization of deferred stock compensation was million  of which  was attributable to research and development expenses and million was attributable to general and administrative expenses 
the decrease in compared to is due to the deferred stock compensation being amortized using the graded vesting method  which results in higher amortization in the earlier years 
the decrease is partially offset by re measuring options and warrants granted to consultants to current fair market value  in accordance with eitf issue no 

table of contents net interest income net interest income was  in  compared to million in the decrease in net interest income is a reflection of lower investment balances and lower average interest rates 
income taxes as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively  available to offset future regular and alternative taxable income 
the net operating loss carryforwards and the research and development credit carryforwards will expire between and the maximum annual use of the net operating loss carryforwards is limited in situations where changes occur in our stock ownership 
because of our lack of earnings history  the resulting deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
the utilization of the loss and credit carryforwards to reduce future income taxes will depend on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards 
we have not completed an analysis of internal revenue code section limitations on the cumulative net operating loss carryforward 
however  the annual limitations are not expected to prevent utilization of the net operating loss carryforward due to significant increases in value indicated by the successive issuances of our stock 
if a change in ownership has occurred  there will be an annual limitation  however  this limitation is not expected to result in a loss of the deferred tax benefit 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues total revenues were million in  compared to million in license fees of million and million during and  respectively  were attributable to an exclusive license agreement signed in october these amounts represent the earned portion of the million initial license fee  which was amortized over months

at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  compared with million at december  working capital at december  was million  compared to million at december  the decrease in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and working capital is primarily due to the use of funds for operating purposes and the purchase of equipment 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  compared to million in the increase in the use of cash in operating activities is principally due to expenditures to support our current phase ii clinical trials for agi for atherosclerosis and post angioplasty restenosis and agix for rheumatoid arthritis 
we expect that our cash expenditures to conduct clinical trials will increase substantially throughout  due primarily to the phase iii clinical trial for agi net cash provided by investing activities was million in  compared to million used in investing activities in net cash provided by investing activities during consisted primarily of the sales of available for sale securities  with the proceeds reinvested in interest bearing cash equivalents  partially offset by the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements

net cash provided by financing activities in consisted primarily of million received from the private placement of our common stock in june in march  we entered into a revolving credit facility with silicon valley bank the bank in the amount of up to million to be used for working capital requirements 
borrowings under this line of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus floating rate and will become due months from closing 
at december  there was no outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility 
we also entered into an equipment loan facility with the bank in the amount of up to million to be used to finance existing and new equipment purchases 
borrowings under the equipment loan facility bear interest rates that were fixed at the time of each advance  and each advance matures in months from the date of the advance

the following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations thereafter operating leases  net of sublease income long term debt total contractual obligations 
table of contents based upon the current status of our product development and commercialization plans  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  the proceeds from our recent public offering  along with our revolving credit facility and equipment loan facility with silicon valley bank  will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next months 
however  our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the status of product development  the time and cost involved in conducting clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs of filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent and other intellectual property claims  competing technological and market developments  and our ability to establish new licensing agreements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures on market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to continue to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  all of which have a minimum investment rating of a p  money market funds  and government and non government debt securities 
the average duration of all of our investments has generally been less than one year 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in the base rates that are used to determine the applicable interest rate on the equipment loan facility with silicon valley bank
