item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this form k  are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates the estimates used  including the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses  impairment of intangible assets  and contingencies and litigation 
estimates are based upon historical experience  current economic conditions and other factors that management considers reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates result in judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities when these values are not readily available from other sources as well as assessing and identifying the accounting treatments of commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is established to absorb known and inherent losses attributable to loans and leases outstanding and related off balance sheet commitments 
the adequacy of the allowance is monitored on an ongoing basis and is based on management s evaluation of numerous factors 
these factors include the quality of the current loan portfolio  the trend in the loan portfolio s risk ratings  current economic conditions  loan concentrations  loan growth rates  past due and nonperforming trends  evaluation of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans  historical charge off and recovery experience and other pertinent information 
approximately of columbia s loan portfolio is secured by real estate and a significant depreciation in real estate values in oregon and washington would cause management to increase the allowance for loan and lease losses 
retained mortgage servicing rights are measured by allocating the carrying value of the loans between the assets sold and the interest retained  based on the relative fair value at the date of the sale 
the fair market values are determined using a discounted cash flow model 
mortgage servicing assets are amortized over the expected life of 
table of contents the loan and are evaluated periodically for impairment 
the expected life of the loan can vary from management s estimates due to prepayments by borrowers 
prepayments in excess of management s estimates would negatively impact the recorded value of the mortgage servicing rights 
the value of the mortgage servicing rights is also dependent upon the discount rate used in the model 
management reviews this rate on an ongoing basis based on current market rates 
a significant increase in the discount rate would negatively impact the value of mortgage servicing rights 
at december   columbia had approximately million in goodwill as a result of business combinations 
columbia adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
on january  ongoing analysis of the fair value of recorded goodwill for impairment will involve a substantial amount of judgment  as will establishing and monitoring estimated lives of other amortizable intangible assets 
columbia applies accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option plans 
accordingly  compensation costs are recognized as the difference between the exercise price of each option and the market price of columbia s stock at the date of each grant

columbia may become party to various legal proceedings 
these matters have a high degree of uncertainty associated with them

there can also be no assurance that all matters that may be brought against columbia are known to them at any point in time 
overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with columbia s audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto as of december  and and for each of the three years in the period ended december  included elsewhere in this report 
columbia bancorp columbia is a financial holding company  which conducts operations principally through its wholly owned subsidiary columbia river bank crb 
crb is a state chartered bank  which offers a broad range of services to its customers  primarily small and medium sized businesses  farmers  and individuals

columbia s two south central washington full service branches serve the communities of goldendale and white salmon 
on december   columbia formed columbia bancorp trust i trust  a wholly owned delaware statutory business trust  for purposes of issuing trust preferred securities 
the trust issued million of trust preferred securities at a floating rate indexed to the day libor with a margin of 
these securities are considered to be tier i for regulatory capital purposes 
columbia s goal is to grow its earning assets while maintaining a high return on equity and high asset quality 
the key to this  in columbia s view  is to emphasize personal  quality banking products and services for its customers  to hire and retain competent branch and administrative personnel  and to respond quickly to customer demand and growth opportunities 
columbia also intends to increase its penetration in its existing markets  and to expand into new markets through further suitable acquisitions and new branch openings

net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loan and investment security portfolios  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and bank borrowings from other sources  such as trust preferred securities 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  spread and margin 
volume refers to the dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
spread refers to the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to total average interest earning assets and is influenced by the relative level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
average balances and average rates earned and paid

the net interest spread for year  increased basis points over year total interest earning assets averaged million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the corresponding periods in and most of the increase occurred in the loan category 
increases in the loan portfolio are attributed to favorable interest rates and the execution of columbia s strategy to provide personal  quality banking products and services  to hire experienced lending personnel in strategic branch locations and administrative capacities  and to emphasize its marketing strategies

the allowance is maintained at an amount management believes to be sufficient to absorb losses in the loan portfolio 
factors considered in establishing an appropriate allowance include a careful assessment of the financial condition of the borrower  a realistic determination of the value and adequacy of underlying collateral  the condition of the local economy and the condition of the specific industry of the borrower  a comprehensive analysis of the levels and trends of loan categories  and  a review of delinquent and classified loans 
columbia applies a systematic process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  including an internal loan review function and a quarterly analysis of the adequacy of the allowance 
the quarterly analysis includes determination of specific potential loss factors on individual classified loans  historical potential loss factors derived from actual net charge off experience and trends in nonperforming loans  and potential loss factors for other loan portfolio risks such as loan concentrations  the condition of the local economy  and the nature and volume of loans 
for the year ended december  the allowance for loan losses totaled million  compared to million at december   and million at december  this represents an increase of between and and an increase of between and a more detailed review of the loan loss provision and allowance for loan losses is presented in table the recorded values of loans actually removed from the consolidated balance sheets are referred to as charge offs and  after netting out recoveries on previously charged off loans  become net charge offs 
columbia s policy is to charge off loans when  in management s opinion  the loan or a portion thereof is deemed uncollectible  although concerted efforts are made to maximize recovery after the charge off 
when a provision for loan loss is recorded  the amount is based on past charge off experience  a careful analysis of the current portfolio  and an evaluation of economic trends in columbia s market areas 
management will continue to closely monitor the loan quality of new and existing relationships through stringent review and evaluation procedures and by making loan officers accountable for collection efforts 
for the year ended december   loan charge offs exceeded recoveries by  as compared to and  when loan charge offs exceeded recoveries by  and  respectively 
a more detailed review of the net charge offs is presented in table noninterest income total noninterest income increased from year through year  but declined from year through during the prior three years  noninterest income changed from million in  to million in  and to million in noninterest income is primarily comprised of five categories service charges and fees  mortgage group net revenues  credit card discounts and fees  financial services department income  and other noninterest income 
each of the categories increased during the prior three years  except for mortgage group revenues 
mortgage group revenues increased million from to  but decreased million from to the decrease in mortgage group revenues during was due to higher amortization expense and valuation write downs of crb s mortgage servicing asset 
management attributes this to accelerated prepayment rates in mortgage loans serviced due in large part to the low mortgage rate environment 
service charges and fees were million for the year  compared to million for the year  and million for the year the growth in service charges and fees were attributable to growth in deposits and the implementation of an overdraft protection product known as bounce 
the bounce product allows demand deposit customers to overdraw their accounts within a pre established limit for a fee 
the remainder of the increases 
table of contents in noninterest income is primarily attributable to improved revenues and growth received from credit card discounts and fees  financial services fee income  and other noninterest income fees and charges 
noninterest expense noninterest expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits  occupancy costs  data processing expenses and other noninterest expenses 
a measure of columbia s ability to control noninterest expenses is the efficiency ratio 
for the year ended december   the efficiency ratio was  as compared to in and in the efficiency ratio reflects an improving trend due to growth in revenue from the net interest margin and efforts by management to monitor and control overhead expenses 
noninterest expense for was million  as compared to million for and million for the changes in noninterest expense are the result of increased personnel expenses due to higher incentive compensation and commissions paid to personnel  occupancy expense  and other noninterest expenses 
the additional increases relate primarily to costs associated with growth in operations and continued investment in technology and communication systems 
income taxes the provision for income taxes was million in  million in and million in the provision resulted in effective combined federal and state tax rates of in  in  and in the effective tax rates differ from combined estimated statutory rates of principally due to the effects of nontaxable interest income  which is recognized for accounting purposes but not for tax purposes

table of contents financial condition investments a year to year comparison shows that columbia s investment securities at december   totaled million  compared to million at december   and million at december  this represents a decrease of between and and a decrease of between and the decrease in the investment portfolio is primarily a function of call provisions that were being exercised during the prior two years of falling interest rates 
for the years ended december   and  no single investment security held by columbia equaled or exceeded of it consolidated shareholders equity 
on december   investments in federal funds sold an overnight investment were million and investments in restricted stock were million 
the balance of federal funds sold is influenced by cash demands  customer deposit levels  loan activity  and other investment transactions 
columbia follows a financial accounting principle which requires that investment securities be identified as held to maturity or available for sale 
held to maturity securities are those that columbia has the intent and ability to hold until they mature or are called 
available for sale securities are those that management may sell if liquidity requirements dictate or if alternative investment opportunities arise 
the mix of available for sale and held to maturity investment securities is determined by management  based on columbia s asset liability policy  management s assessment of the relative liquidity of columbia  and other factors 
at december   the investment portfolio  excluding restricted equity securities  consisted of available for sale securities and held to maturity securities 
at december   the portfolio consisted of available for sale securities and held to maturity securities 
at december   columbia s investment portfolio  excluding restricted equity securities  consisted of available for sale securities and held to maturity securities 
at december   columbia s investment portfolio had total net unrealized gains of approximately million 
this compares to net unrealized gains of approximately  at december  and net unrealized gains of  at december  unrealized gains and losses reflect changes in market conditions and do not represent the amount of actual profits or losses 
actual realized gains and losses occur at the time investment securities are sold or called 
federal funds sold are short term investments that mature on a daily basis 
columbia invests in these instruments to provide for additional earnings on excess available cash balances 
because of their short maturities  the balance of federal funds sold fluctuates dramatically on a day to day basis 
the balance on any one day is influenced by cash demands  customer deposit levels  loan activity and other investment transactions

loans columbia s loan policies and procedures establish the basic guidelines governing its lending operations 
generally  the guidelines address the types of loans that it seeks  target markets  underwriting and collateral requirements  terms  interest rate and yield considerations  and compliance with laws and regulations 
all loans or credit lines are subject to approval procedures and amount limitations 
these limitations apply to the borrower s total outstanding indebtedness to crb  including the indebtedness of any guarantor 
the policies are reviewed and approved by the board of directors of crb 
bank officers are charged with loan origination in compliance with underwriting standards overseen by the loan administration department and in conformity with established loan policies 
on an annual basis  the board of directors determines the lending authority of the president and the chief credit officer  who then delegate lending authority to other lending officers 
such delegated authority may include authority related to loans  letters of credit  overdrafts  uncollected funds  and such other authority as determined by the board  the president or chief credit officer within their delegated authority 
the chief credit officer has the authority to approve loans up to a lending limit as set by the board of directors 
all loans above the lending limit of the chief credit officer  and up to a certain limit  are reviewed for approval by the president or chief operating officer 
loans  which exceed this limit  are subject to review and approval by the board s loan committee 
all loans approved by the board loan committee are reviewed by the full board at regularly scheduled meetings 
columbia s unsecured legal lending limit was million and real estate secured lending limit was million at december  columbia seldom makes loans for an amount approaching its legal lending limits 
net outstanding loans totaled million at december   representing an increase of million  or compared to million as of december  loan commitments grew to million as of december   representing an increase of million over year end columbia s net loan portfolio at december   includes loans secured by real estate  commercial loans  agricultural loans  consumer loans  deferred loan fees and reserve for loan loss 
the largest category is concentrated in real estate loans 
this is primarily due to the significant growth of mortgage and commercial real estate loan activity 
residential mortgage loans usually are temporarily financed on the balance sheet before being sold to the secondary market 
some commercial loans are secured by real estate  but are used for purposes other than financing the purchase of real property  such as inventory financing and equipment purchases  where real property serves as collateral for the loan

loans are charged against the reserve for loan losses when management believes that the collectibility of the principal or a portion thereof is unlikely 
the reserve is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb possible losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible  based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans and prior loan loss experience 
accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions  collection efforts and collateral position  that the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful 
columbia follows guidance from the interagency policy statement issued by the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec regarding allowance for loan and lease losses methodologies 
on a quarterly basis  management determines the appropriate allowance for loan and lease losses using the following three methodologies loss allocation to groups of loans by internal risk grade loss allocation by loan type loss allocation by historical loss percentage management s determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based on an assessment of the risk in the portfolio given the conditions at the time 
this assessment consists of certain loans and leases being evaluated on an individual basis  as well as all loans being categorized based on common credit risk attributes and as a group 
the adequacy of the allowance is monitored on an ongoing basis and is based on management s evaluation of numerous factors 
these factors include the quality of the current loan portfolio  the trend in the loan portfolio s risk ratings  current economic conditions  loan concentrations  loan growth rates  past due and non performing trends  evaluations of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans  historical charge off and recovery experience and other pertinent information 
the following table shows columbia s loan loss experience for the periods indicated table years ended december  dollars in thousands loans outstanding at end of period  net of unearned interest income average loans outstanding for the period reserve for loan losses balance  beginning of year loans charged off commercial

the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses should be measured in the context of several key ratios the ratio of the reserve to total outstanding loans  the ratio of total nonperforming loans to total loans  and  the ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding 
since  columbia s ratio of the reserve for loan losses to total loans has ranged from to 
the amounts provided by these ratios have been sufficient to fund columbia s charge offs  which have not been historically significant  and to provide for potential losses as the loan portfolio has grown 
these ratios have also been consistent with the level of nonperforming loans to total loans 
from december  through december   nonperforming loans to total loans have ranged from a low of to a high of 
this experience tracks with changes in the ratio of the reserve for loan losses to total loans and with the actual balances maintained in the reserve account 
finally  columbia s historical ratio of net charge offs to average outstanding loans illustrates its favorable loan charge off and recovery experience 
from december  through december   net charge offs ranged from to of average loans 
management believes columbia s loan underwriting policies and its loan officers knowledge of their customers are significant contributors to columbia s success in limiting loan losses 
during the year ended december   columbia recognized  in loan losses and  in recoveries for a net charge off of  these were consistent with columbia s historical experience in view of the growth in its loan portfolio

further  columbia may place loans that are not contractually past due or that are deemed fully collateralized on nonaccrual status to promote better oversight and review of loan arrangements 
loans on nonaccrual status at december  totaled approximately  compared to  at december  and million at december  columbia has adopted procedures to identify and monitor loans that have had their original terms restructured to accommodate borrowers financial needs 
loan revisions and modifications are provided to meet the credit needs of borrowers in weakened financial condition and to enhance ultimate collection 
as of december   loans that had been classified as restructured were insignificant and were performing in accordance with their restructured terms

table of contents the federal reserve board and the federal deposit insurance corporation have established minimum requirements for capital adequacy for financial holding companies and member banks 
the requirements address both risk based capital and leveraged capital 
the regulatory agencies may establish higher minimum requirements if  for example  a corporation has previously received special attention or has a high susceptibility to interest rate risk 
the following reflects columbia s various capital ratios at december   and december   as compared to regulatory minimums for capital adequacy purposes table december  december  regulatory minimum tier i capital total risk based capital leverage ratio liquidity and capital resources columbia has adopted policies to maintain a relatively liquid position to enable it to respond to changes in the financial environment and ensure sufficient funds are available to meet customers needs for borrowing and deposit withdrawals 
generally  columbia s major sources of liquidity are customer deposits  sales and maturities of investment securities  the use of borrowings from the federal home loan bank of seattle and correspondent banks  brokered certificates of deposit and net cash provided by operating activities 
as of december  and  unused and available lines of credit totaled million and million  respectively 
scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and unscheduled loan prepayments are not as stable because they are influenced by general interest rate levels  competing interest rates available on other investments  market competition  economic conditions  and other factors 
liquid asset balances include cash  amounts due from other banks  federal funds sold  and securities available for sale and securities held to maturity with maturities occurring within three months

columbia has met liquidity needs primarily from cash balances in correspondent accounts  income from operations  borrowing from the federal home loan bank and the growth of deposits 
the analysis of liquidity also includes a review of the changes that appear in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended december  the statement of cash flows includes operating  investing  and financing categories 
operating activities include net income of million  which is adjusted for non cash items and increases or decreases in cash due to changes in certain assets and liabilities 
investing activities consist primarily of both proceeds from and purchases of securities and the impact of the net growth in loans 
financing activities present the cash flows associated with deposit accounts and reflect various transactions with stockholders 
at december   columbia had outstanding unfunded lending commitments of million 
nearly all of these commitments represented unused portions of credit lines available to consumers under credit card and other arrangements and to businesses 
many of these credit lines will not be fully drawn upon and  accordingly  the aggregate commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
management believes that columbia s sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet likely calls on outstanding commitments  although there can be no assurance in this regard

crb uses a servicing portfolio valuation model to comply with statement of accounting standard sfas accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
the servicing portfolio valuation model evaluates the value of the mortgage servicing asset by calculating the results from data input into the system including assumptions regarding  discount rates  inflation rates  effective tax rates  annual servicing costs  servicing premiums  stratified loans by term  weighted average terms to maturity  weighted average coupon  numbers of loans serviced and constant prepayment rate

income for the years ended december  and was million  and  respectively 
the mortgage banking group s earnings in were negatively impacted by higher mortgage servicing asset amortization and valuation write downs 
this was caused by the low mortgage interest rate environment  which prompted a record number of borrowers to refinance their mortgage loans 
in addition  the mortgage banking group s net interest income was lower in due to improvements made in the department s ability to increase the turnaround time from loan funding to investor settlement  thereby reducing the interest income and related interest expense 
furthermore  operating expenses were higher in as a result of higher consulting  sundry losses and general operating expenses 
noninterest income in was higher than the prior two years as a result of higher loan fees  improvements in the use of derivatives in secondary marketing and loan servicing revenue

the table below sets forth the distribution of columbia s contingent liabilities by off balance sheet type 
commitments to extend credit increased primarily due to growth and expansion of commercial real estate construction lending from our deschutes county trade area

table of contents derivative management the mortgage group accepts loan applications that typically do not fund and close for to days 
during this time  the loan is considered to be in the open mortgage pipeline 
once the loan is either funded or closed  it is then removed from the open mortgage pipeline 
the loans that comprise the open mortgage pipeline have been price locked to the borrower  therefore  interest rate fluctuations may result in gains and or losses from the sale of loans to the secondary market 
the risk of price fluctuations to the open mortgage pipeline is managed by the use of derivatives forward contracts and put options 
the underlying securities of the derivatives are mortgage backed securities  which generally correspond with the composition of the open mortgage pipeline 
the structure of the derivatives is intended to serve as a hedge against the impact of rising and falling interest rates 
the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognized in earnings in the same period  as required by statement of financial standards sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
as of december   there were million in interest rate locked mortgage loans contained in the open mortgage pipeline and the notional amount of the derivatives totaled million in forward contract and put option hedges 
the difference in amount between the loans in the open mortgage pipeline and the notional amount of the derivatives is due to the risk management practices for anticipating loan fall out 
loan fall out occurs when a locked loan in the open mortgage pipeline is not closed and funded by mortgage group 
the two most common causes for fall out occur when borrowers either do not fulfill a real estate purchase contract or close their loan with a competing provider of mortgage loans 
the risk of fall out does expose crb to changes in value of the derivatives that would apply to non existent loans in the open mortgage pipeline 
this risk is usually greater during periods of falling interest rates when borrowers take advantage of market conditions to shop for the lowest mortgage rates among competing mortgage loan providers 
columbia monitors this risk and adjusts its derivative coverage over the open mortgage pipeline in order to minimize risk of losses from fall out 
however  there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates and changes in loan fall out will not have a material adverse impact on earnings

factors that may affect future results of operations in addition to the other information contained in this report  the following risks may affect columbia 
if any of these risks occur  our business  financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected 
growth and management 
our financial performance and profitability will depend on our ability to manage recent and possible future growth 
although management believes that it has substantially integrated the business and operations of recent acquisitions  there can be no assurance that unforeseen issues relating to the acquisitions will not adversely affect us 
in addition  any future acquisitions and continued growth may present operating and other problems that could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute our growth strategy or maintain the level of profitability that we have recently experienced 
changes in market interest rates 
our earnings are impacted by changing interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the demand for new loans  the credit profile of existing loans  the rates received on loans and securities  and rates paid on deposits and borrowings 
the relationship between the rates received on loans and securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings is known as interest rate spread 
given our current volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets  our interest rate spread could be expected to increase during times of rising interest rates and  conversely  to decline during times of falling interest rates 
exposure to interest rate risk is managed by monitoring the re pricing frequency of crb s rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities over any given period 
although we believe our current level of interest rate sensitivity is reasonable  significant fluctuations in interest rates may have an adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
geographic factors 
economic conditions in the communities we serve could adversely affect our operations 
as a result of columbia s community bank focus  our results depend largely upon economic and 
table of contents business conditions in our service areas 
a deterioration in economic and business conditions in our market areas  particularly in the agricultural and real estate industries on which some of these areas depend  could have a material adverse impact on the quality of our loan portfolio and the demand for our products and services  which in turn may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
further  a downturn in the national economy might further exacerbate local economic conditions 
the extent of the future impact of these events on economic and business conditions cannot be predicted 
regulation 
we are subject to government regulation that could limit or restrict our activities  which in turn could adversely impact our operations 
the financial services industry is regulated extensively 
federal and state regulation is designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers  and not to benefit our stockholders 
these regulations can sometimes impose significant limitations on our operations 
in addition  these regulations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time 
significant new laws or changes in existing laws or repeal of existing laws may cause our results to differ materially 
further  federal monetary policy  particularly as implemented through the federal reserve system  significantly affects credit conditions for us 
competition 
competition may adversely affect our performance 
the financial services business in our market areas is highly competitive 
it is becoming increasingly competitive due to changes in regulation  technological advances  and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers 
we face competition both in attracting deposits and in making loans 
we compete for loans principally through the interest rates and loan fees we charge and the efficiency and quality of services we provide 
increasing levels of competition in the banking and financial services industries may reduce our market share or cause the prices we charge for our services to fall 
our results may differ in future periods depending upon the nature or level of competition 
credit risk 
a source of risk arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained if a significant number of our borrowers  guarantors and related parties fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans 
we have adopted underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and credit policies  including the establishment and review of the allowance for credit losses  that management believes are appropriate to minimize this risk by assessing the likelihood of nonperformance  tracking loan performance and diversifying our credit portfolio 
these policies and procedures  however  may not prevent unexpected losses that could materially affect our results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk management in the banking industry  a major risk involves changing interest rates  which can have a significant impact on columbia s profitability 
columbia manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within the guidelines established by its asset liability committee alco 
alco has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with asset liability management policies  including interest rate risk exposure  capital position  liquidity management and the investment portfolio 
reports prepared by alco are provided to the board of directors on a regular basis 
asset liability management simulation models are used to measure interest rate risk 
the models quantify interest rate risk through simulating forecasted net interest income and economic value of equity over a month time horizon under various rate scenarios 
the economic value of equity is defined as the difference between the market value of current assets less the market value liabilities 
by measuring the change in the present value of equity under different rate scenarios  management is able to identify interest rate risk that may not be evident in simulating changes in the forecasted net interest income 
table below shows the simulated percentage change in forecasted net interest income and the economic value of equity using a stable rate environment 
the change in interest rates assumes an immediate  parallel and sustained shift in the base interest rate forecast 
through these simulations  management estimates the impact on net interest income and present value of equity based on a and basis point upward or downward gradual change of market interest rates over a one year period 
the analysis did not allow rates to fall below zero 

table of contents table percent change percent change in net interest in present value change in interest rates income of equity basis points basis points basis points basis points as illustrated in the above table  our balance sheet is currently asset sensitive  meaning that interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liability in a given period 
therefore  according to the model  net interest income should increase slightly when rates increase and shrink somewhat when rates fall 
this is primarily a result of the concentration of variable rate and short term commercial loans in columbia s portfolio 
the simulation model does not take into account future management actions that could be undertaken  should a change occur in actual market interest rates 
also  certain assumptions underlie modeling simulation results and these assumptions may have significant impact on the results 
these include assumptions regarding the level of interest rates and balance changes of deposit products that do not have stated maturities 
these assumptions have been developed through a combination of industry standards and expected pricing behavior in the future 
the model also includes assumptions about changes in the composition or mix of the balance sheet 
the results derived from the simulation model could vary significantly due to external factors such as changes in prepayment assumptions  early withdrawals of deposits and unforeseen competitive factors 
mortgage servicing asset the crb mortgage group has recorded a mortgage servicing asset msa that contains risk due to loan prepayments 
the value of the msa will likely decline when interest rates fall due to an increase in loan prepayments 
the msa is measured on a quarterly basis with the use of a model that incorporates published data for prepayment speeds  servicing costs  ancillary income and discount rates 
any decrease in value of the msa is recorded as valuation impairment 
however  actual fair values may differ significantly from the measured valuation due to crb s analysis of available third party market quotations 
the value of the mortgage servicing asset is interest rate sensitive and is likely to require quarterly valuation adjustments during if mortgage interest rates decline further from all time low levels 
however  if mortgage rates were to increase in  management would expect that mortgage service asset valuations to decrease 
in this instance  the monthly mortgage servicing asset amortization expense would be sufficient to amortize the msa over the expected remaining life of the serviced mortgage loan portfolio
