table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general viasat was incorporated in and completed its initial public offering in we are a leading provider of advanced broadband digital satellite communications and other wireless networking and signal processing equipment and services to the defense and commercial markets 
based on our extensive experience in complex defense communications systems  we have developed the capability to design and implement innovative communications solutions that enhance bandwidth utilization by applying our sophisticated networking and digital signal processing techniques 
our goal is to leverage our advanced technology and capabilities to capture a significant share of the global satellite communications services and equipment segment of the high growth broadband communications market for both government and commercial customers 
our internal growth to date has historically been driven largely by our success in meeting the need for advanced communications products for the us military 
by developing cost effective communications products incorporating our advanced technologies we have continued to grow the markets for our defense products and services 
our current defense products include tactical data links  including the advanced multifunction information distribution system  or mids  simulation and test equipment  which allows the testing of sophisticated airborne radio equipment without expensive flight exercises  information security and assurance products and services  which enable military and government users to communicate secure information over secure and non secure networks  uhf dama satellite communications products consisting of modems  terminals and network control systems  and government broadband products and services  which provide innovative solutions to government customers to increase available bandwidth using existing satellite capacity 
the defense market continues to be a critical and core element of our overall business strategy 
we have been increasing our focus in recent years on offering satellite based communications products to address commercial market needs 
in pursuing this strategy  we have acquired three strategic satellite communication equipment providers the satellite networks business of scientific atlanta in fiscal year  comsat laboratories products business from lockheed martin in fiscal year  and us monolithics  llc in fiscal year our commercial business accounts for approximately of our revenues in fiscal year and of our revenues in fiscal year to date  our principal commercial offerings include very small aperture terminals vsats  broadband internet equipment over satellite  network control systems  network integration services  network operation services  gateway infrastructure  antenna systems and other satellite ground stations 
in addition  based on our advanced satellite technology and systems integration experience  we won several important projects in the three key broadband markets enterprise  consumer and in flight mobile applications 
the overall economic environment has slowed the roll out of new telecommunication services affecting the satellite portion of this market 
however  the development we have accomplished in this area has positioned us well as existing and new service providers aim to meet the growing demand for broadband communication 
to date  our ability to grow and maintain our revenues has depended on obtaining additional sizable contract awards 
it is difficult to predict the probability and timing of obtaining these awards 
generally  revenues are recognized as services are performed using the percentage of completion method  measured primarily by costs incurred to date compared with total estimated costs at completion or based on the number of units delivered 
we provide for anticipated losses on contracts by charges to income during the period in which they are first identified 
our products and services are provided primarily through three types of contracts fixed price  time and materials and cost reimbursement contracts 
historically  approximately for fiscal year  for 
table of contents fiscal year  and for fiscal year  of our revenues were derived from fixed price contracts which require us to provide products and services under a contract at a stipulated price 
the remainder of our annual revenue was derived from cost reimbursement contracts  under which we are reimbursed for all actual costs incurred in performing the contract to the extent that such costs are within the contract ceiling and allowable under the terms of the contract  plus a fee or profit  and from time and materials contracts which reimburse us for the number of labor hours expended at an established hourly rate negotiated in the contract  plus the cost of materials utilized in providing such products or services 
historically  a significant portion of our revenues has been generated from funded research and development contracts 
the research and development efforts are conducted in direct response to the specific requirements of a customer s order and  accordingly  expenditures related to such efforts are included in cost of sales when incurred and the related funding which includes a profit component is included in revenues 
revenues for our funded research and development were approximately million or of our total revenues during fiscal year  million or of our total revenues during fiscal year and million or of our total revenues during fiscal year we also invest in independent research and development  which is not directly funded by a third party 
we expense independent research and development costs as they are incurred 
independent research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  supplies  prototype materials  testing and certification related to research and development programs 
independent research and development expenses were approximately of revenues during fiscal year  of revenues during fiscal year  and of revenues during fiscal year as a government contractor  we are able to recover a portion of our independent research and development expenses pursuant to our government contracts 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses viasat s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
generally  revenues are recognized as services are performed using the percentage of completion method  measured primarily by costs incurred to date compared with total estimated costs at completion or based on the number of units delivered 
historically  we have been able to make reliable estimates and have therefore been able to reasonably determine our percent complete 
however  many of our contracts involve the development of new technology and  as a result  the development of estimates underlying our percent complete is inherently subject to greater uncertainty 
even with our experience in estimating contract costs it is possible that our actual results could ultimately differ from our estimates  or that estimates could change as we make progress on a contract 
either of these potential outcomes would result in adjustments to the revenues and profits recorded on a contract 
from time to time we have recorded such changes in estimate 
it is also possible that adjusted estimates could indicate that we will incur a loss on a contract 
we provide for anticipated losses on contracts by a charge to income during the period in which they are first identified 

table of contents capitalized software development costs costs of developing software for sale are charged to research and development expense when incurred  until technological feasibility has been established 
software development costs incurred from the time technological feasibility is reached until the product is available for general release to customers are capitalized and reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value 
once the product is available for general release  the software development costs are amortized based on the ratio of current to future revenue for each product with an annual minimum equal to straight line amortization over the remaining estimated economic life of the product not to exceed five years 
the determination of net realizable value involves judgment and estimates of future revenues to be derived from a product  as well as estimates of estimated future costs of manufacturing that product 
we use our experience in the marketplace in making judgments in estimating net realizable value  but our estimates may differ from the actual outcome 
we periodically assess the assumptions underlying our estimates and  if necessary  we would adjust the carrying amount of capitalized software development costs downward to our new estimate of net realizable value 
we capitalized costs related to software developed for resale of million for the fiscal year ended march   million for the fiscal year ended march  and million for the fiscal year ended march  amortization expense of software development costs was million for   for and for these software development costs are part of other assets on the balance sheet and the related amortization expense is recorded as a charge to cost of revenues on the statement of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
historically  our bad debts have been minimal  a contributing factor to this is that a significant portion of our sales have been to the us government 
more recently  commercial customers are making up a larger part of our revenues 
except for orbcomm global  lp  we have experienced a good collection record from our commercial customers 
see the liquidity and capital resources section of this md a for more information on orbcomm 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of march  and our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of march  allowance for warranty reserves we provide limited warranties on certain of our products for periods of up to five years 
we record a liability for our warranty obligations when products are shipped based upon an estimate of expected warranty costs 
amounts expected to be incurred within twelve months are classified as a current liability 
for mature products the warranty costs estimates are based on historical experience with the particular product 
for newer products that do not have a history of warranty costs  we base our estimates on our experience with the technology involved and the types of failure that may occur 
it is possible that our underlying assumptions will not reflect the actual experience and in that case  future adjustments will be made to the recorded warranty obligation 
impairment of goodwill we account for our goodwill under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the sfas no 
goodwill impairment model is a two step process 
first  it requires a comparison of the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units that have goodwill assigned to them 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in this process  a fair value for goodwill is estimated  based in part on the fair value of the reporting unit used in the first step  and is compared to its carrying value 
the shortfall of the value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
sfas no 

table of contents requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually at the same time every year  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
we estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows and other indicators of fair value 
the forecast of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of the future revenues and operating costs  based primarily on existing firm orders  expected future orders  contracts with suppliers  labor agreements  and general market conditions 
changes in these forecasts could cause a particular reporting unit to either pass or fail the first step in the sfas no 
goodwill impairment model  which could significantly influence whether a goodwill impairment needs to be recorded 
the cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation 
impairment of long lived assets property and equipment and other intangible assets we adopted sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets on april  in accordance with sfas no 
 we assess potential impairments to our long lived assets  including property and equipment and other intangible assets  when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized when the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset or group of assets is less than its carrying value 
any required impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value  and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and charged to results of operations 
no such impairments have been identified by us 
income tax valuation allowance on a quarterly basis  management evaluates the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance as of year end 
realization of our net deferred tax assets as of march  is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future income 
we believe that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized based on forecasted income 
the amount of the net deferred tax assets actually realized could vary if there are differences in the timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities or changes in the actual amounts of future taxable income 
we have incurred losses from operations over the past several quarters 
if our operating results do not improve significantly in the near term and if the outlook remains unclear we will be required to establish a valuation allowance against all of our net deferred tax assets based upon applicable accounting criteria 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance  an expense will be recorded within the provision for income taxes line in the statement of operations 

table of contents results of operations the following table presents  as a percentage of total revenues  income statement data for the periods indicated 
years ended march  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative independent research and development acquired in process research and development amortization of intangible assets income loss from operations income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
revenues decreased from million for fiscal year to million for fiscal year the decrease was largely due to lower revenues from commercial broadband activities and commercial antenna system sales  partially offset by higher sales volume from certain government products 
revenues from the government segment increased from million for fiscal year to million for fiscal year the increase in revenues was primarily related to our mids  mobile satcom and secure networking product lines 
revenues from the commercial segment decreased from million for fiscal year to million for fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to lower revenues from broadband and ground systems product lines 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased from million of revenues for fiscal year to million of revenues for fiscal year this decrease in gross profit was primarily due to lower sales and related margin  earnings charges from contract overruns on fixed price development contracts  lower gross profit yielded on certain vsat product sales  and a million charge related to astrolink international llc 
see liquidity and capital resources for a more detailed explanation of astrolink 
these decreases were partially offset by the margin produced by higher sales volume in the government product lines and higher margins experienced in both the government and vsat product lines related to manufacturing efficiencies 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased from million of revenues for fiscal year to million of revenues for fiscal year included in sg a for fiscal year was approximately million for the write off of receivables related to orbcomm 
see liquidity and capital resources for a more detailed explanation of orbcomm 
excluding the charge relating to orbcomm  sg a expenses increased from million of revenues for fiscal year to million of revenues for fiscal year the increase was primarily related to higher bid and proposal costs to pursue and secure new business  and an increase in legal costs related to the claim against scientific atlanta  partially offset by a decrease in sales and marketing expenses 
sg a expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and expenses for business development  marketing and sales  bid and proposal  finance  contract administration and general 
table of contents management 
some sg a expenses are difficult to predict and vary based on specific government and commercial sales opportunities 
independent research and development 
independent research and development ir d expenses increased from million of revenues for fiscal year to million of revenues for fiscal year this increase was primarily due to reduced customer funded research and development and delays in certain program awards  which resulted in continued development under viasat funding 
in addition  us monolithics current products are primarily in the development phase and a full twelve months of expenses of million for these products were included in our fiscal year results versus only one quarter of expenses of million that were included in our fiscal results 
acquired in process research and development 
purchased in process research and development ipr d charge resulted from the acquisition of comsat laboratories and accounted for million of revenues for fiscal year an independent valuation was performed and used as an aid in determining the fair value of the purchased ipr d projects and other intangibles 
projects were identified in which there were research and development efforts underway where technological feasibility had not been reached 
at the time of the acquisition  comsat laboratories was developing a satellite network terminal that expands the frequencies on which an existing terminal could operate 
the date when the project was expected to reach technological feasibility at the time of the acquisition was september we estimated based on man hours incurred versus man hours required to complete the project that at the acquisition date the project was complete and would require approximately  to complete 
using the income approach  the value calculated for the ipr d associated with the satellite network terminal was million 
the project has proceeded since the acquisition and is now in production 
amortization of intangible assets 
the acquisition of the satellite networks business in fiscal year and comsat laboratories and us monolithics in fiscal year were accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
the dates of acquisition of comsat laboratories and us monolithics were both after june  and were accounted for under sfas therefore  the goodwill of those two acquisitions has not been subject to amortization 
the intangible assets are being amortized over useful lives ranging from two to ten years 
below is the allocation of the intangible assets from acquisitions  including goodwill and the amortization expense for the years ended march  and amortization for the years ended march  satellite comsat us networks laboratories monolithics total in thousands intangible assets existing technology contracts and relationships non compete agreements other amortizable assets total intangible assets goodwill acquired workforce goodwill total goodwill totals intangible assets and goodwill 
table of contents as a result of adopting sfas for our fiscal year ended march   we no longer amortize the intangibles assets acquired workforce of million or goodwill of million acquired in the satellite networks business acquisition 
acquired workforce does not meet the separability requirements of sfas and was subsumed into goodwill beginning april  the estimated amortization expense of long lived intangible assets for the next five fiscal years is as follows amortization in thousands expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year interest expense 
interest expense increased from  for fiscal year to  for fiscal year the increase resulted from higher outstanding borrowings coupled with higher loan fees in fiscal year at march  there were million in outstanding borrowings under our line of credit 
at march  there were million in outstanding borrowings under our line of credit 
interest income 
interest income decreased from  for fiscal year to  for fiscal year this decrease resulted from lower average invested cash balances and lower yields 
equity in loss of joint venture 
equity in loss of joint venture decreased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year this decrease was related to the loss from immeon networks 
provision for income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was a benefit in fiscal year compared to a benefit of in fiscal year we generate research and development credits that are not variable to income  so when the income or loss before tax is close to zero as it was in fiscal year  the tax provision benefit percentage will be impacted to a high degree by the credits 
therefore  the annual effective tax rate for fiscal year cannot be meaningfully compared to the effective tax rate for fiscal year fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
revenues increased from million for fiscal year to million for fiscal year the increase was largely due to higher revenues from commercial broadband activities and commercial product sales  aided by the acquisition of comsat laboratories in fiscal year  and by higher sales volume from certain government products 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenues resulting from the completion of certain development contracts 
revenues from the government segment increased from million for fiscal year to million for fiscal year revenues from the commercial segment increased from million for fiscal year to million for fiscal year the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of comsat laboratories and higher revenues from broadband programs 
gross profit 
gross profit increased from million of revenues for fiscal year to million of revenues for fiscal year this increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher volumes of commercial product sales boosted in part by the acquisition of comsat laboratories  by higher sales volume from broadband development programs and from increased government product sales 
these increases were partially offset by lower gross profit resulting from the completion of certain development programs 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue  for fiscal year versus for fiscal year was primarily related to our contract mix in  which included more development programs which have a historically lower profit margin than do production programs 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses increased from million of revenues for fiscal year to million of revenues for fiscal year of this increase  approximately million was due to the write off of receivables related to orbcomm 
see liquidity and capital resources for a more detailed explanation of orbcomm 
before the charge relating to orbcomm the sg a expenses were million of revenues for fiscal year  a increase over fiscal year the remaining increase in sg a expenses was due to the addition of expenses for comsat laboratories and us monolithics  both acquired in fiscal year  the integration costs incurred to integrate our recent acquisitions  for marketing commercial products  increased business development  and additional administrative staffing to support our continued growth 
independent research and development 
ir d expenses increased from million of revenues for fiscal year to million of revenues for fiscal year this increase was primarily due to ir d spending in our new acquisitions of comsat laboratories and us monolithics during fiscal year acquired in process research and development 
ipr d charges result primarily from two recently completed acquisitions 
the acquisition of the satellite networks business accounted for million of revenues for fiscal year and the acquisition of comsat laboratories accounted for million of revenues for fiscal year an independent valuation was performed and used as an aid in determining the fair value of the purchased ipr d projects and other intangibles 
projects were identified in which there were research and development efforts underway where technological feasibility had not been reached 
the satellite networks business is developing a next generation mobile subscriber communicator 
this next generation product contains a new chipset  new connectors  added functionality  bigger programming space and a longer battery life than the legacy product and will be sold at a lower price 
the estimated completion date at the time of the acquisition was november we estimated based on man hours incurred versus man hours required to complete the project that at the acquisition date the project was complete and would require approximately  to complete 
using the income approach the value calculated for the ipr d associated with the mobile subscriber communicator was million 
the market for this product has not materialized to the extent anticipated and as a result  the completion date has been delayed 
the project has been put on hold and additional funds will not be spent until the market develops 
the satellite networks business also has the skyrelay and the skylinx products 
the skyrelay development of a next generation terminal included a terminal with newer interfaces  an additional ip port and consolidated functionality onto a single card 
at the time of acquisition  the project completion was expected to be in june of and we estimated based on man hours incurred versus man hours required to complete the project that the project was estimated to be complete and would require approximately million to complete 
using the income approach the value calculated for the ipr d associated with skyrelay was  the skylinx related ipr d projects are the mesh working and mbps channel unit 
based on the same completion criteria as skyrelay  it was estimated the skylinx related ipr d was complete at the date of acquisition and would require approximately  to complete 
both projects were completed in fiscal also using the income approach  the value calculated for ipr d associated with skylinx was  at the time of the acquisition  comsat laboratories was developing a satellite network terminal that expands the frequencies on which an existing terminal could operate 
the date when the project was expected to reach technological feasibility at the time of the acquisition was september we estimated based on man hours incurred versus man hours required to complete the project that at the acquisition date the project was complete and would require approximately  to complete 
using the income approach the value calculated for the ipr d associated with the satellite network terminal was million 
the project has proceeded since the acquisition and is now in production 
amortization of intangible assets 
the acquisition of the satellite networks business in fiscal year and comsat laboratories and us monolithics in fiscal year were accounted for by the purchase method 
table of contents of accounting 
the dates of acquisition of comsat laboratories and us monolithics were both after june  and were accounted for under sfas therefore  the goodwill of those two acquisitions has not been subject to amortization 
the intangible assets are being amortized over useful lives ranging from two to ten years 
below is the allocation of the intangible assets from acquisitions  including goodwill and the amortization expense for the years ended march  and amortization for the years ended march  satellite comsat us networks laboratories monolithics total in thousands intangible assets existing technology contracts and relationships non compete agreements other amortizable assets total intangible assets goodwill acquired workforce goodwill total goodwill totals intangible assets and goodwill interest expense 
interest expense increased from  for fiscal year to  for fiscal year total outstanding equipment loans were  at march  at march  there were no outstanding equipment loans and million in outstanding borrowings under our line of credit 
interest income 
interest income decreased from million for fiscal year to  for fiscal year this decrease resulted from lower average invested cash balances and lower yields 
equity in loss of joint venture 
equity in loss of joint venture increased from  in fiscal year to million in fiscal year this increase was primarily related to the loss from immeon networks 
provision for income taxes 
our effective income tax rate decreased from a provision of for fiscal year to a benefit of for fiscal year the decrease in effective tax results primarily from a change in estimated research and development tax credit for the current and prior year 
the change in estimate was made based upon historical detailed information received from scientific atlanta in conjunction with the satellite networks business acquisition for calculating base period percentages 
backlog as of march   we had firm backlog of million  of which million was funded 
this compares to firm backlog of million at march   of which million was funded  not including options of million 
of the million in firm backlog at march   approximately million is expected to be delivered in fiscal year and the balance of approximately million is expected to be delivered in fiscal year and thereafter 
total new awards for both commercial and defense products were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year we include in our backlog only those orders for which we have accepted purchase orders 
our firm backlog does not include contract options of million 
these options include million of indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts for our uhf dama satellite communications products and million of idiq contracts for our other products 

table of contents backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales 
a majority of our contracts can be terminated at the convenience of the customer since orders are often made substantially in advance of delivery  and our contracts typically provide that orders may be terminated with limited or no penalties 
in addition  purchase orders may present product specifications that would require us to complete additional product development 
a failure to develop products meeting such specifications could lead to a termination of the related purchase order 
the backlog amounts as presented are comprised of funded and unfunded components 
funded backlog represents the sum of contract amounts for which funds have been specifically obligated by customers to contracts 
unfunded backlog represents future amounts that customers may obligate over the specified contract performance periods 
our customers allocate funds for expenditures on long term contracts on a periodic basis 
our ability to realize revenues from contracts in backlog is dependent upon adequate funding for such contracts 
although funding of our contracts is not within our control  our experience indicates that actual contract fundings have ultimately been approximately equal to the aggregate amounts of the contracts 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations to date primarily with cash flows from operations  bank line of credit financing  equity financing and loans for the purchase of capital equipment 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year was million as compared to cash used in operating activities in fiscal year of million 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal year was million as compared to cash used in investing activities in of million 
we acquired million in equipment and invested million in capitalized software in fiscal compared to million in equipment and million in capitalized software in fiscal  excluding acquisitions 
during fiscal year  we used million of cash in the acquisitions of comsat laboratories and us monolithics 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year was million as compared to cash provided by financing activities in of million 
this decrease was primarily the result of completing a public stock offering for million and million in net cash proceeds from our line of credit in fiscal at march   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  million in working capital and million in outstanding borrowings under our line of credit 
we also had million outstanding under standby letters of credit leaving borrowing availability under the line of credit of million 
at march   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  million in working capital and million in outstanding borrowings under our line of credit 
on february   we executed an amended and restated revolving loan agreement of million with union bank of california and comerica bank california 
under the revolving loan facility we have the option to borrow at the bank s prime rate or at libor plus  in each case  an applicable margin 
the revolving facility contains financial covenants that set maximum debt to ebitda limits  minimum quarterly ebitda limits  minimum quick ratio limit and a minimum tangible net worth limit 
the borrowing commitment is also limited by viasat s level of accounts receivable and inventory 
the revolving loan facility s maturity date is september  and is collateralized by cash  accounts receivable and inventory of viasat 
on january  we reached a settlement with astrolink international llc with respect to contractual termination payments for contracts that were terminated on december  we received a cash payment of million 
depending on the implementation of the astrolink business plan  we may also receive additional consideration in the form of cash  a consulting contract and satellite airtime from the new astrolink business providing aggregate additional value of approximately million under specified circumstances or may receive certain non cash consideration in the form of capital equipment under other circumstances 
the assets at risk prior to the astrolink settlement totaled million and included accounts receivable due from astrolink in the amount of approximately million  inventory specific to astrolink of 
table of contents million and million in prepaid airtime on astrolink satellites 
the value of the future consideration from the settlement will depend on the new astrolink business 
due to the contingent nature and uncertainty of the value of the additional consideration to be received by us pursuant to the settlement  we have reduced our assets related to astrolink to zero 
as a result  we have taken a charge through cost of goods sold in the fiscal year ended march  of million  which is the difference between the assets at risk of million and the cash received of million 
on september  orbcomm global  lp and seven of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for chapter relief in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware as part of its efforts to restructure and reorganize its business 
orbcomm has continued its efforts to maintain and operate its network of low earth orbit leo satellites and related ground facilities while it restructures its operations 
although discussions continued with orbcomm  we no longer considered it reasonably possible that our assets at risk would be recovered 
the amount at risk was accounts receivable of million  and a charge to selling  general and administrative costs was made for this amount and was included in our results for fiscal year ended march  in september  we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the future sale of up to million of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares  and warrants 
the securities may be offered from time to time  separately or together  directly by us or through underwriters at amounts  prices  interest rates and other terms to be determined at the time of the offering 
we currently intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the securities under the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital and the repayment or refinancing of our debt 
in january  we issued  shares of our common stock under this registration statement for proceeds  net of offering costs  of approximately million
