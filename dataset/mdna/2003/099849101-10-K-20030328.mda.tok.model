we provide our customers with a comprehensive solution designed to help them deliver better software faster by offering products that address the definition  design  development  testing  change management and deployment steps of the software application lifecycle 
we believe our standards based solutions improve software quality  accelerate delivery  lower cost of ownership and reduce risk of error for software development 
despite challenging economic conditions for the software and information technology industry  the year ended december  included our eleventh consecutive quarter of profitability and twelfth consecutive quarter of positive cash flow from operations 
we market software development and application infrastructure technologies to businesses of all sizes worldwide 
when customers curtail their information technology budgets  
table of contents elect to purchase less or delay such purchases  our business like that of our competitors and software industry peers naturally suffers 
in addition  the prolonged downturn in the financial markets during  combined with larger structural problems in industries such as telecommunications  appear to have further dampened it capital expenditures in excess of the anticipated effects of more typical economic cyclicality 
despite these challenges  several features of our model and strategy provided for growth during  and we believe  provide a foundation for growth in during  total net revenues grew to million from million in license and other revenues increased to million in from million in gross margins increased to in from in operating expenses increased to million in from million in net income decreased to million  or of total net revenues  in from million  or of total net revenues  in strategic acquisitions have been an important component of our overall growth strategy 
during  we successfully completed the acquisitions of vmgear and advanced training center ltda  or atc  as well as the acquisition of certain assets of highlander and boldsoft 
in october  we entered into an agreement to acquire starbase  a publicly traded company 
starbase is a provider of software configuration and requirements management tools to assist in managing development projects from inception to deployment and to facilitate the development of software solutions and applications in a more efficient manner 
in the initial tender offer pursuant to the merger agreement  we acquired approximately of the outstanding shares of starbase and began consolidating the operating results of starbase in late november in october  we also entered into an agreement to acquire privately held togethersoft  a provider of design driven development solutions that enable visual modeling 
the starbase and togethersoft acquisitions were both completed in january critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  investments  restructuring  asset impairment  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from licenses of our software and sales of related services  which include assistance in implementation and integration  post contract customer support  training and consulting 
we recognize license fees on contracts that do not involve significant implementation or integration essential to the functionality of our products upon delivery when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is probable 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we determine the value for services and post contract customer support based upon vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  or sop  no 
 software revenue recognition  or sop  and related accounting literature 
vsoe for the services element is based upon the standard hourly rates we charge for services  given the complexity of the services and experience of the professionals performing the services  or the amount charged on similar transactions 
vsoe for annual post contract customer support is established by the stated future 
table of contents renewal rates included in the contracts or the amount charged on a similar transaction 
we recognize revenues for the license portion of a multiple element arrangement based upon the residual contract value as prescribed by sop no 
 modification of sop no 
with respect to certain transactions 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not generally request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured or there are extended payment terms  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
we recognize revenue for software licensed with software assurance for a specific time period  or term license  ratably over the term of the license 
increasingly  we are selling more comprehensive software solutions 
these solutions often involve significant implementation or integration essential to the functionality of our products 
we recognize licenses and service revenues associated with contracts involving significant implementation or integration only when the services are completed 
we also recognize licenses and other revenues for contracts involving modification of software under the percentage of completion method 
we defer the costs associated with these contracts until revenue is recognized 
we classify revenues from these arrangements as license and service revenues  based upon the estimated fair value of each element based upon vsoe 
provisions for estimated contract losses are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we recognize revenues from reseller arrangements upon shipment to the reseller  with allowances for estimated future returns and exchanges provided based upon our return policy 
we maintain allowances for product returns from end user and channel customers based upon historical return rates of end user customers  current economic trends  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and the type and quantity of inventory held by channel customers 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may have resulted in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
the provision for sales returns and rebates amounted to million in  as compared to million in  reflecting a greater emphasis on direct sales to end users in we offer return rights to end users only in limited circumstances 
if future returns increase over historical levels  additional allowances may be required 
other service revenues from consulting and training services are recognized as such services are performed 
service revenues from post contract customer support are recognized ratably over the support period  generally one year 
accounting for acquisitions pursuant to a merger agreement  by and between borland  starbase and galaxy acquisition corp  a wholly owned subsidiary of borland on october   we commenced an all cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of starbase at a price of per share 
in the initial tender offer  which expired on november   we purchased approximately of the outstanding starbase shares 
upon the completion of the initial tender  we began consolidating the operating results of starbase 
during  we also completed the acquisitions of boldsoft  vmgear and highlander 
we accounted for these acquisitions as purchases in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 business combinations 
as such  we have reported all the acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities of the acquired companies at fair value 
we recognize the fair value of the purchased identifiable intangibles as an operating expense over the estimated useful life of each identifiable intangible  unless the identifiable intangible is determined to have an indefinite life 
we recognize the fair value associated with in process technology as an operating expense during the period the transaction is consummated 
we value employee stock options assumed as part of the acquisition using the black scholes valuation model 
the value of all vested awards and the value of unvested awards in excess of the intrinsic value of the unvested awards are included as part of the purchase 
table of contents consideration 
we report the intrinsic value of the unvested awards as deferred compensation and record it as an operating expense over the remaining vesting period of the award 
we value our stock issued as part of the purchase consideration based upon the average of the closing prices for the five day trading period surrounding the transaction 
we report total consideration in excess of the fair value of the acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets  net of assumed liabilities  as goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  we evaluate the goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
impairment of goodwill is performed in two steps 
first  the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared to the fair value of the reporting unit including the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value of the reporting unit  we move to the second step of the impairment test 
the second step of the impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  the impairment loss shall be recognized as an operating expense in an amount equal to that excess 
we did not record a loss on impairment of goodwill during the years ended december   or we may incur substantial liabilities connected to the termination of employees  asserted claims or litigation  or termination of leases in connection with our acquisitions that are accounted for as purchases 
we have incurred such liabilities with the acquisition of starbase in the year ended december  and will incur significant additional liabilities relating to the acquisitions of starbase and togethersoft in the year ending december  we estimate acquisition related costs at the time of the acquisition and accrue these costs  in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination  or eitf  with an offsetting entry to goodwill 
these accruals involve estimates regarding future events  sometimes several years in the future 
we may make revisions and adjustments of the accrual and the related goodwill based on actual events 
restructuring we report costs associated with employee terminations and other exit activities in accordance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring or eitf we record employee termination benefits as an operating expense when management having the appropriate level of authority to involuntarily terminate employees approves and commits us to the plan of termination and establishes the benefit the employees will receive upon termination  the benefit arrangement is communicated to the employees  the plan specifically identifies the number of employees to be terminated  their job functions and their locations  and the period of time to complete the plan of termination indicates that significant change to the plan of termination is not likely 
we record other exit costs as an operating expense when management having the appropriate level of authority approves and commits us to the plan  the exit plan identifies all significant actions to be taken to complete the exit plan  and actions required by the exit plan will begin as soon as possible after the commitment date 
we recognize other exit costs at the commitment date if they are not associated with revenue generating activity and the costs are either incremental to other costs incurred by us in the conduct of our activities prior to the commitment date and will be incurred as a direct results of the exit plan  or represent amounts to be incurred by us under a contractual obligation that existed prior to the commitment date and will either continue after the exit plan is completed with no economic benefit to us or be a penalty incurred by us to cancel the contractual obligation 
on july   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or sfas sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf as a result  when we adopt sfas  we will recognize a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost as defined in eitf was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas eliminates this definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in eitf sfas also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
sfas is applicable for all 
table of contents exit activity initiated after december  we do not believe that our adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debt patterns  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our gross accounts receivable balance was million and million at december  and  respectively 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and related interpretations 
under apb  compensation cost is measured as the excess  if any  of the closing market price of our stock at the date of grant over the exercise price of the option granted 
we recognize compensation cost for stock options  if any  ratably over the vesting period 
generally  we grant options with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of our stock on the grant date 
accordingly  we have not recognized any compensation expense for our stock option plans 
we provide additional pro forma disclosures as required under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas if we had adopted the fair value method prescribed in sfas  we would have recognized stock based compensation expense  net of tax  of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively  and our net income loss would have been million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
please see discussion in recent accounting pronouncements for an explanation of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 or sfas we account for stock options issued to non employees  excluding non employee directors  under sfas and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments with variable terms that are issued for consideration other than employee services under sfas  or eitf we record the expense of such services based upon the estimated fair value of the equity instrument using the black scholes pricing model 
assumptions used to value the equity instruments are consistent with equity instruments issued to employees 
we charge the value of the equity instrument to earnings over the term of the service agreement 
we had no such expenses in the years ended december   and  respectively 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas  we evaluate the accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed 
sfas requires recognition of impairment of long lived assets if the net book value of such assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset for assets to be held and used  or the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value less cost to dispose for assets to be disposed 
fair value is determined primarily by using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
no impairment was recorded during the years ended december   or  respectively 
in accordance with sfas  we account for property held for sale at the lower of the carrying value or the fair value less selling costs  based on an independent appraisal 
at december   we classified an office building we own and lease to a third party  with a book value of million  as property held for sale  as we are actively seeking a purchaser for the property 

table of contents investments we hold minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in the current carrying value of these investments  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
in  we recorded a charge of million to write down our investment in trolltech as and million to write down our loan to appforge  inc valuation allowance for deferred tax assets deferred income taxes are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas under sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using the tax rates and laws in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
sfas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets are more likely than not to occur 
realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generating sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and from net operating loss carryforwards 
based on the weight of the available evidence  we have provided a valuation allowance against substantially all of our net deferred tax assets 
management will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowance 
if our assessment of the deferred tax assets or the corresponding valuation allowance were to change  we would record the related adjustment to income during the period in which we make the determination 
our tax rate may also vary based on our operating results and the mix of income or loss in the domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
contingencies our current estimated range of liability related to certain litigation is based on claims for which our management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
we have recorded the minimum estimated liability related to those claims  where there is a range of loss 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liabilities could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
as of december   we have accrued approximately million for professional service fees and other costs with respect to our potential liability for pending litigation and other claims  including million for professional service fees and other costs with respect to potential liability for pending litigation and other claims related to the starbase and togethersoft acquisitions 
determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidation we have a number of foreign subsidiaries that together account for approximately of our total net revenues  of our assets and of our total liabilities as of december  in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they keep their accounting records  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses which  under the relevant accounting guidance are either included within the statements of operations or as a separate part of our stockholders equity under the caption cumulative comprehensive income 
under the relevant accounting guidance  the treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependent upon our management s determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on management judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions  including billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures  is considered the functional currency  but any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations is also considered 

table of contents cumulative translation adjustments include any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements when the functional currency of any subsidiary is the local currency 
however  if the functional currency is deemed to be the united states dollar then any gain or loss associated with the translation of these financial statements would be included within our statement of operations 
if we dispose of any of our subsidiaries  any cumulative translation gains or losses would be realized and recorded within our statement of operations 
if we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the united states dollar  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within our statement of operations 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed above  we consider the relevant subsidiary s local currency to be the functional currency for each of our international subsidiaries 
accordingly we had cumulative translation gains of approximately million and million  which were included as part of cumulative comprehensive income within our balance sheet at december  and  respectively 
during the years ended december   and  translation adjustments of million  million and million  respectively  were included under cumulative comprehensive income 
had we determined that the functional currency of our subsidiaries was the united states dollar  these gains and losses would have been included in our results of operation for each of the years presented 
the magnitude of these gains or losses is dependent upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which we transact business against the united states dollar and the significance of the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
these currencies include the japanese yen  the euro  the united kingdom pound sterling  singapore dollar  hong kong dollar  chinese yen  korean won  brazilian real  australian dollar and canadian dollar 
any future translation gains or losses could have been significantly higher than those noted in each of these years 
in addition  if we determine that a change in the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries has occurred at any point in time or we sell or liquidate one of our subsidiaries  we would be required to include any translation gains or losses from the date of change in our statement of operations

licenses and other revenues from our java product group increased in the year ended december  to million from million in the prior year  primarily due to growth in the java market 
during  new releases from the java product group included jbuilder and in the future  we expect growth in revenues from our java product group to depend upon the growth in the java market  the timing of new product releases and general economic conditions

during  new releases from the rad products group included delphi and c builder licenses and other revenues from our rad products group increased in the year ended december  to million from million in the prior year 
future revenue growth from our rad group will depend upon the timing of market adoption of the microsoft

licenses and other revenues from our enterprise product group represented  and of total licenses and other revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
license revenues from our enterprise products group decreased in the year ended december  to million from million in the prior year  primarily due to general economic conditions  especially in the telecommunications and financial sectors  and a corresponding decrease in customer information technology budgets for enterprise applications 
license revenues from our enterprise product group decreased in the year ended december  to million from million in the prior year  primarily due to the impact of the decline in economic conditions in the united states that resulted in decreased demand from us customers 
revenue growth from our enterprise product group will depend upon the recovery in corporate spending for deployment solutions  our ability to provide compelling technical solutions for software deployment to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and our ability to tightly integrate our deployment solutions with our development solutions 
developer services platform or dsp 
our dsp products group consists of starteam  caliberrm  codewright and dsp products 
licenses and other revenues from our dsp product group represented  and of total licenses and other revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
licenses and other revenues from our dsp product group in the year ended december  was million comprised mainly of new products resulting from the acquisition of starbase 
at the end of november  we acquired a interest in starbase and accordingly  consolidated the results of operations  including revenues  of starbase in late november during  new releases from the dsp product group included starteam  caliberrm and codewright 
in the future  we expect licenses and other revenues from our dsp product group to grow due to the inclusion of revenues from sales of new products obtained through acquisitions in our results for an entire year 
in  we expect that a significant portion of our license revenues will be attributable to our newly acquired togethersoft and dsp product lines 
licenses and other revenues growth for any of our products will require that we continue to improve in our current offerings through feature enhancements and integration 
table of contents between our product lines as well as continued execution of our direct sales force in selling our development solutions to large enterprises 
service revenues service revenues represent amounts earned for technical support  consulting and training services for software products 
net service revenues were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  representing  and of total net revenues for those years  respectively 
service revenues increased million in the year ended december  from the year ended december  primarily as a result of an increase in technical support revenues 
technical support revenues were million  million and million  in the years ended december   and  respectively  and represented   and of total service revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the year to year growth in the technical support revenues in from and in from was due to increased sales of our enterprise level support offerings  even though enterprise license revenues have decreased slightly sequentially from to we expect this trend to continue should we have success selling into larger enterprises 
our service revenues may grow as our new enterprise solution offerings increase in complexity and include more services as a component of larger sales contracts 
during january  we completed the acquisitions of starbase and togethersoft 
with the additional product offerings from these two acquisitions combined with our current offerings  we will further our focus on providing an end to end solution for enterprises challenged with large scale software development projects 
such large scale software development projects require a higher level of understanding of our product offerings in order to enhance the development process and shorten the time to deployment 
as such  our service offerings may become a larger component of our overall revenues over time 
international net revenues revenues from sources outside the united states  or non us revenues  represented approximately  and of total net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in the percentage of non us revenues for the year ended december   as compared to the years ended december  and  was principally due to the growing adoption of the java language in the emea and the asia pacific regions as defined below and the decline in our enterprise business in the us due to the continued downturn in the us economy 
we expect non us revenues to continue to be more than of total net revenues in future periods  though the us percentage should increase in due to the acquisitions of starbase and togethersoft  which had greater percentages of their revenues from us operations 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our total net revenues or operating results for the years ended december   and however  our non us revenues would be adversely affected if the us dollar were to strengthen against major foreign currencies including the japanese yen  the united kingdom pound sterling and the euro 
the following table presents our total net revenues by region in thousands year ended december  americas emea asia pacific total net revenues our americas operations include activities of our parent company located in the united states and subsidiaries in canada  mexico and brazil

royalty costs were of licenses and other revenues in each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
if royalty costs as a percentage of licenses and other revenues were to increase by of licenses and other revenues  we would have experienced an additional cost of licenses and other revenues of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the level of royalty costs in future periods will be dependent upon our ability to obtain favorable licensing terms for our products that include third party technology and the extent to which we include such third party technology in our product offerings

service revenues gross margins were  and in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in gross margins for the year ended december  when compared with the years ended december  and was due to a decrease in consulting and training costs during the year ended december  when compared with years ended december  and in future periods  we expect increases in our cost of service revenues only as a function of our ability to grow our service revenues 
operating expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses for the years ended december   and  were million  million and million  respectively 
such expenses were  and of total net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively

table of contents we believe that large enterprises currently require software development solutions that will reduce the time to deployment 
in order to address this need  we plan to offer integrated software solutions that address all aspects of the application development lifecycle 
in  we expect total dollars spent on research and development to increase over due to the acquisitions of starbase and togethersoft 
in  we expect to spend a significant amount of our research and development dollars on integration of our traditional borland products with our newly acquired products from starbase and togethersoft 
our future success will be dependent in part on our ability to technologically integrate these products 
this effort has already begun with the commercial release of our new borland together edition for jbuilder and borland enterprise studio for java 
these products were released for commercial shipment in march during  we entered into contracts to perform non recurring engineering projects for several customers 
under these arrangements  we received cash payments for engineering services upon the achievement and delivery of certain milestones 
we accounted for the cash payments received under these arrangements as a reduction of research and development expenses 
during  we received approximately million in cash payments under these arrangements 
there were no such arrangements in the years ended december  and selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these expenses were of total net revenues for each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars in the year ended december  from the years ended december  and primarily due to the increase in salaries related to the continued expansion of our direct sales force and marketing organization 
selling  general and administrative salaries expense was million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase due to the acquisition of starbase and togethersoft 
we also expect an increase in sales and marketing spending in in order to support a larger installed customer base 
in addition  to the extent our direct sales increase  we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase as a result of variable compensation from our sales incentive plans 
general and administrative expenses declined in to of selling  general and administrative expenses from in and in as we leveraged our existing administrative resources over a higher revenue base 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase over the levels  particularly in the first half of the year  as we integrate our acquisitions  however  we believe this spending should decrease in the second half as operations are combined in the completion of our integration activities of the starbase and togethersoft operations

table of contents during the year ended december   we recorded restructuring  amortization of intangibles and acquisition related expenses in the amount of million  which consisted of million in compensation expense associated with earn out provisions in the vmgear and bedouin acquisitions  million in operating expenses from the amortization of purchased intangibles acquired from starbase  boldsoft  highlander  bedouin and vmgear  million in restructuring costs resulting from the highlander and vmgear acquisitions  million charge for in process development related to the starbase acquisition and million in write down of leasehold improvements related to exiting a leased facility  offset by a non recurring benefit totaling million related to the settlement of various litigation matters 
these benefits resulted from the reversal of reserves established in prior periods based upon estimates of the cost of resolving the litigation 
changes for the year ended december  included acquisition related expenses and the amortization of purchased intangibles acquired from bedouin and engine informatica  ltd  and for compensation expense associated with an earnout provision on the bedouin acquisition  in the amount of million 
during  we reversed approximately million in restructuring and severance reserves and million in legal reserves established in prior periods that were determined to be no longer necessary 
the restructuring and severance reserves were reversed primarily because the individuals identified in the restructure were not terminated 
the legal reserve was reversed because the related legal matters were resolved for substantially less  in the aggregate  than the amount of the legal reserves which we established in prior periods for such matters 
this reversal was offset by expenses associated with the proposed merger with corel corporation which was terminated in may of million  restructuring charges of million in connection with the termination of employees  amortization of intangibles of million and in process research and development of million 
the following table summarizes the current portion of our restructuring activity accounted for in accordance with eitf for the years ended december   and amounts in thousands severance and benefits other asset charges facilities other total accrual at december  restructuring cash paid during non cash costs reversal of previous restructuring accrual at december  restructuring cash paid during non cash costs reversal of previous restructuring accrual at december  restructuring cash paid during non cash costs reversal of previous restructuring accrual at december  we have also recorded a restructuring reserve associated with certain leases in the united kingdom in the amount of million as of december  this amount represents the excess of our contractual obligation over the minimum sublease income 
due to the timing of the contractual payments  this amount has been included in other long term liabilities 

table of contents in  we expect our restructuring  amortization of intangibles and acquisition related expenses will increase significantly due to the identifiable intangibles acquired from starbase and togethersoft in january and restructuring of our operations in conjunction with the integration of these acquired companies 
loss on write down of investments and long term asset during the year ended december   we recorded a loss of million to write down certain investments and long term assets 
this loss related to a charge of million for the write off of a cost based investment in trolltech as and a one time charge of million to write off a loan that was deemed uncollectable 
gain on sale of corporate assets we previously held a minority common stock interest in starfish 
on september   motorola  inc completed the acquisition of starfish 
the acquisition involved a combination of cash and motorola common stock  part of which was withheld in escrow 
based upon the cash and common stock consideration received or released from escrow  we recorded gains of approximately million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
on march   we completed the sale of our headquarters facility at enterprise way in scotts valley to enterprise way associates  llc as assignee of the scanlankemperbard companies 
we received approximately million in consideration for the facility 
consideration in the transaction was net of million to cover costs to improve the facility and million in other disposal costs 
we recorded a write down of the facility of million during the quarter ended december  in conjunction with the sale of the facility  we entered into a long term lease arrangement to use approximately of the facility for corporate purposes 
on september   we entered into an amendment to our lease with scanlankemperbard which decreased the space leased by us to approximately of the facility 
interest income  net and other interest income  net and other was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decline in interest income  net and other during when compared to reflects a decrease in interest income of million  despite slightly higher balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  due to decreases in prevailing interest rates 
the decline in interest income  net and other during when compared with reflects a decrease in interest income of million  despite higher cash balances  due to a decline in prevailing interest rates 
the weighted average yields on investments in the year ended december  ranged between and and between and in the year ended december  changes in interest rates will  of course  continue to impact our interest income performance in future periods 
we also expect that interest income will decrease in due to expected lower cash balances following the payment of cash consideration in connection with the togethersoft and starbase acquisitions 
income taxes on a consolidated basis  we generated a pre tax profit of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we recorded an income tax provision of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  which equaled  and of our pre tax profit  respectively 
the increases in income tax provision as a percentage of pre tax profit from in from and in from were principally related to a greater amount of our non us pretax profits subject to tax and to a reduction in the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 

table of contents our effective tax rate is primarily dependent on the location of taxable profits  if any  due to our net operating loss carryforwards in certain  but not all  jurisdictions  and the imposition of withholding taxes on revenues regardless of our profitability 
we currently expect that our effective tax rate will remain at approximately in  but our actual rate will be highly dependent on jurisdictional mix 
our income tax provision for the year ended december  differs from the statutory tax rate principally due to our limited utilization of net operating losses in the us  income taxes in certain us jurisdictions and withholding taxes on certain payments we receive from non us persons that are imposed regardless of our profitability 
for us federal and state income tax purposes  we have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million at december   respectively 
we also have available us federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
these credit carryforwards expire between and  if not utilized 
we also have alternative minimum tax  or amt  credit carryforwards for us federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which do not expire 
utilization of federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before full utilization 
we also have approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards in various foreign jurisdictions 
deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances of approximately million relate to certain us operating loss carryforwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock options  the tax benefit of which  when recognized  will be accounted for as a credit to additional paid in capital rather than a reduction of the income tax provision

currency 
currency fluctuations did not have a significant impact on our cash position during the year ended december  although we partially hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk  strengthening of the us dollar against the euro  united kingdom pound sterling  australian and singapore dollars or japanese yen could harm our business 
we cannot predict currency exchange rate fluctuations and there can be no assurance that foreign currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse impact on our future cash flows and operating results 
see further discussion of foreign currency risk in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk acquisitions 
some acquisitions we entered into have forward cash commitments due to earnouts that may form all or part of the purchase price 
as of december   we are contractually committed to make certain cash payments under our acquisition agreements with the former shareholders of highlander and vmgear 
a portion of these payments are contingent upon meeting certain financial performance requirements 
the contingent payments for these two transactions are not to exceed million and will be paid  if earned  over a three year period 
during  we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with starbase  and galaxy acquisition corp  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours 
pursuant to the merger agreement  we commenced a tender offer for all the outstanding shares of starbase at a price of per share in cash 
total consideration to be paid for all the shares of starbase is approximately million  including approximately million that we paid in during  we also entered into an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization with privately held togethersoft and two wholly owned subsidiaries whereby an aggregate of million in cash was agreed to be paid to the stockholders and option holders of togethersoft and  shares of borland common stock were agreed to be issued to such stockholders 
the acquisition of togethersoft was completed in january and approximately million of the cash consideration will be paid in the first half of and the remaining cash consideration will be held in escrow to secure certain indemnification obligations set forth in the agreement and plan of merger and reorganization 
during the year ended december   we engaged several professional service firms to perform certain accounting  legal and financial advisory services in conjunction with the proposed acquisitions of togethersoft and starbase 
the bulk of these fees are payable when completed 
we expect to pay these fees during the first half of with our existing cash reserves 
the fees will be capitalized as part of the purchase accounting for the respective acquisition 
our principal source of liquidity has been cash generated from operations 
in the past  we have invested significantly in our operations 
we anticipate that operating expenses and planned capital expenditures will continue to constitute a material use of our cash resources 
also  in the first half of  we expect to use a significant amount of resources in order to fund the completion of the starbase and togethersoft acquisitions and integrate their operations 
we also expect that our capital expenditures in the next year will be greater than fiscal year in addition  we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in other businesses  technologies or products lines 
we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating expense requirements for at least the next twelve months 
at some point in the future we may require additional funds for either operating or strategic purposes and may seek to raise the 
table of contents additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings 
if we ever need to seek additional financing  there is no assurance that this additional financing will be available  or if available  will be available on reasonable terms and not dilutive to our stockholders 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin until this interpretation  a company generally included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns 
we are currently evaluating the effect of this statement on our results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 or sfas sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
sfas is effective for financial statements for years ending after december  we have adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf eitf provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  or fin fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value  or market value  of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee 
however  the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor s obligations do not apply to product warranties or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or sfas sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost as defined in eitf was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in eitf sfas also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
sfas is applicable for all exit activity initiated after december  we do not believe that our adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our results of operation  financial position or cash flows  although sfas may impact the timing of recognition of costs associated with future restructuring  exit or disposal activities 

table of contents approval of non audit services during the year ended december   the audit committee of our board of directors approved new or recurring engagements with pricewaterhousecoopers llp  our independent accountants  to provide the following non audit services accounting advisory services related to certain acquisitions  certain tax related services and statutory audits 
factors that may affect future results and market price of stock we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves many risks  some of which are beyond our control 
the following is a discussion that highlights some of these risks 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations or results 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business operations or results could be harmed 
we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing business 
as a part of our business strategy  we have recently acquired a number of businesses  products and technologies  including our significant acquisitions of togethersoft and starbase 
acquisitions entail numerous risks  including difficulties associated with the integration of operations  technologies  products and personnel 
acquisition integration issues are complex  time consuming and expensive and  without proper planning and implementation  could significantly disrupt our business 
the challenges involved in the integration of acquired businesses include  but are not limited to demonstrating to customers that the acquisition will not result in adverse changes in customer service standards or business focus  coordinating sales and marketing efforts to communicate our capabilities effectively  training the acquired companies sales forces on our other technologies and how to engage in solution selling  coordinating and rationalizing research and development activities to enhance introduction of new products and technologies with reduced cost  preserving distribution  marketing and other important relationships and resolving potential conflicts that may arise  minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns  persuading employees that business cultures are compatible  maintaining morale and retaining key employees  in particular those in sales and software engineering positions  coordinating and combining international operations  relationships and facilities  which may be subject to additional risks and constraints imposed by local laws and regulations  managing integration issues of our acquired businesses shortly after  simultaneously with  or pending the completion of  other acquisitions  maintaining productivity and support while consolidating corporate information technology  or it  infrastructure  and combining product offerings and preventing customers from deferring purchasing decisions or switching to other suppliers due to uncertainty about the direction of our product offerings and our willingness to support and service existing products 
in the future  we may continue to make acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies 
however  acquisitions entail numerous risks that  if realized  could harm our operating results 
these risks include  but are not limited to there may not be suitable businesses  products or technologies available for acquisition on terms acceptable to us  
table of contents there may be substantial costs associated with acquisitions  including the potential dilution to our earnings per share  the incurrence or assumption of debt  the assumption of contingent liabilities  the amortization of expenses related to intangible assets and the legal and other fees associated with the negotiation and consummation of the acquisition  we may make acquisitions in markets where we have limited or no prior experience  there is no guarantee that any acquisition we complete will result in earnings accretion  cost efficiencies or synergies  we may expend resources to acquire products and technologies that we are not ultimately able to commercialize  we may acquire businesses that bring with them unanticipated or undisclosed liabilities  risks  costs and expenses  we may acquire businesses or technologies at prices that are later determined post acquisition to be in excess of fair value  integration and other risks of acquisitions may be more pronounced for larger transactions or if multiple acquisitions are pursued simultaneously  and if we fail to identify and complete these transactions  we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally  which may put us at a competitive disadvantage  or we may be harmed by negative market perceptions  any of which would damage our operating results 
we may not be able to successfully compete against current and potential competitors 
our markets are intensely competitive 
rapid change  new and emerging technologies and fierce competition characterize these markets 
the pace of change has accelerated due to the emergence of the internet  and related programming platforms and languages  including sun microsystem s java and microsoft s 
net and c  as well as new operating systems such as linux 
below is a table of our chief competitors for each of our product lines product competitive products caliberrm ibm s rational requisite pro and telelogic s doors together controlcenter ibm s rational rose and rational xde  and embarcadero s describe jbuilder ibm s websphere studio application developer  oracle s jdeveloper  jetbrains intellij and sun microsystems sun one studio delphi c microsoft s visual studio and visual basic optimizeit ibm s rational purify plus and quest s jprobe starteam telelogic s cm synergy  merant s pvcs  ibm s rational clearcase and clearquest and mks source integrity enterprise server  appserver edition bea systems weblogic  ibm s websphere  oracle i and sun microsystems one enterprise server  visibroker edition iona s orbix enterprise server  web edition microsoft s content management server and providers of the apache web server 
table of contents we attempt to differentiate our products from our competitors products based on interoperability  cost of ownership  performance and reliability as well as their effectiveness in addressing our customers needs 
we may not be able to successfully differentiate our products from those of our competitors in the future or be able to continue to enhance our product lines to meet the needs of our customers 
in addition  many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  management  marketing and technical resources than we have 
many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential customers  extensive knowledge of the market and extensive product development  sales and marketing resources 
as a result of their greater resources and established relationships  these competitors may be more successful than we are at developing and marketing products in our markets 
because there are relatively low barriers to entry in a number of our markets  we also expect additional new competition from other established and emerging companies 
in particular  given the growth and adoption of java  we are observing increased attention to the market for java development technologies  and expect additional new entrants 
for example  certain vendors which have previously not focused significant resources on the java development market have altered their product strategies to incorporate java development offerings 
because we are dependent on the market for java development for a substantial portion of our revenue  increased competition in this market could damage our competitive position 
increased competition in our markets  including from companies with substantial resources  could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
any one of these results could substantially reduce our revenues 
bundling arrangements or product give aways by our competitors  including freely available development technologies  may diminish demand for our products or pressure us to reduce our prices 
certain of our competitors  particularly those that are primarily hardware vendors or platform providers  generate a substantially greater proportion of their sales in markets in which we do not directly compete 
we believe a number of these competitors view sales of software development technologies as important for enhancing the functionality of  and demand for  their core products 
as a result  some companies may bundle software development products that compete with our offerings with their other products  such as application servers  work stations  personal computers  operating systems and databases 
when competitors do so  the effective price for software development products that compete with our products may be heavily discounted or offered at no charge 
this could require us to reduce the price of our products and related services  diminish our revenues and harm our profitability 
similarly  industry alliances and arrangements exist or may be formed in the future under which our competitors ally with companies in markets in which we do not compete to bundle products 
these arrangements may result in lower effective prices for our competitors products than our own prices  putting pressure on our business and diminishing our competitive position 
in addition to bundled offerings and bundling arrangements  some competitors make available or have begun making available for no charge to their customers products that compete with our products  including our development solutions such as jbuilder 
while we believe that products made available at minimal or no cost are not able to compete with our offerings on the basis of quality  performance and reliability  among other things  freely available competitive technologies are a risk to our business 
at a minimum  technologies offered at no charge increase pricing pressure and threaten revenue potential 
for example  ibm s open source eclipse initiative is a model under which products that compete with our offerings may eventually become available at minimal or no cost 
ibm eclipse is attempting to create an open source toolkit in which customers can access and create development technologies at no charge 
wide adoption of this model may seriously reduce demand for our products 
consolidation in our industry may impede our ability to compete effectively 
consolidation continues to occur among companies that compete in our markets as firms seek to offer more extensive suites of software products and to take advantage of efficiencies and economies of scale 
additionally  a number of major hardware companies have sought to expand their software and services offerings through 
table of contents acquisitions 
recently  ibm acquired rational software  a competitor of ours 
changes resulting from this and other consolidations may harm our competitive position  particularly as certain products  when offered as part of a bundled suite  are offered for free or are given away to sell more hardware components 
in addition  as the trend toward consolidation continues  we may encounter increased competition for attractive acquisition targets and may have to pay higher prices for those businesses or products 
we are relatively new to selling comprehensive solutions for the application development lifecycle  and we may not be able to successfully compete in that broader market 
the software application lifecycle market has been evolving  as customers are increasingly demanding development solutions that address each stage of the software development lifecycle 
while we believe we maintain strong relationships with the it organizations in large enterprises through our developer network  we do not have extensive experience selling comprehensive development solutions 
historically  we have focused on selling particular products for particular segments of the development process  most notably the sale of development tools 
we have recently acquired a number of companies that we believe provide us with a more comprehensive product offering that is attractive to large enterprises 
however  we have no history of selling these comprehensive solutions and we may be unable to effectively sell these solutions to large enterprises 
to compete successfully in the software application lifecycle market we believe we will need to develop stronger relationships with systems integrators and other strategic partners with access to enterprise accounts and executive level decision makers on software application lifecycle products  coordinate the activities of our various product organizations to provide fully integrated products  including synchronizing release cycles  successfully and efficiently educate our existing marketing  direct sales and indirect sales teams on selling comprehensive solutions  and compete with several very large and well established companies that already compete in these markets 
our increasing focus on enterprise customers may lengthen our sales cycles and increase fluctuations in our financial results 
as we increasingly seek to license software products directly to our customers  particularly large enterprises  we have experienced sales cycles that are substantially more lengthy and uncertain than those associated with our traditional business of licensing software through indirect and retail channels 
as we move to selling customers comprehensive solutions  we believe that a significant percentage of our future revenues will be from enterprise customers 
these transactions typically contain multiple elements  including licenses for development and deployment products  technical support  maintenance  consulting and training services 
as a result  these customers generally commit significant time and resources to evaluating our software  and they require us to expend substantial time  effort and money in establishing the enterprise relationship and in educating them about our software products and solutions 
also  sales to enterprise customers generally require an extensive sales effort throughout the customer s organization and often require final approval by the customer s chief information officer or other senior executive employees 
in particular  while our strategy includes leveraging the loyalty of our developer network to sell our application lifecycle management solutions within their enterprises  we believe that purchase decisions on software application technology often involve more senior level employees than sales of the development products that we have traditionally sold 
all of these factors substantially extend the sales cycle and increase the uncertainty of whether a sale will be made in any particular quarter  or at all 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience delays and uncertainty in our sales cycle as well as increased up front expenses in connection with enterprise sales 
the timing of the execution of enterprise volume licenses  or their nonrenewal by large customers  could cause our results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
in addition  the continued weakness in the market for it investment  particularly for wide scale enterprise wide deployments  has lengthened and may continue to lengthen our sales cycle  as prospective customers defer significant investments in it infrastructure until the market for it investment improves 

table of contents the customers for our comprehensive solutions are  and we expect our customers will continue to be  highly concentrated in a small number of vertical markets  so a continued economic downturn in these markets could significantly harm our revenues 
a large portion of our revenues are derived from customers in a small number of vertical markets such as high technology  telecommunications  government contracts and financial services 
while we believe that customers in these markets are attracted to the performance advantages of our products  continuation or deepening of the current economic downturn in any of these markets could have a significant adverse impact on our revenues 
our revenues from our enterprise business were hurt in and by the economic downturn in these markets  particularly the telecommunications market 
our failure to broaden our base of customers outside these vertical markets could reduce our future revenues if the extended downturn in our targeted vertical markets continues 
if we fail to effectively manage our growth  our infrastructure  management and resources could be strained  our ability to effectively manage our businesses could be diminished and our operating results could suffer 
our future success depends on growing our company 
failure to manage growth effectively could strain our resources  which would impede our ability to increase revenues 
during the past two years  we have increased the number of product releases we make each year and have introduced a number of new products and services 
in addition  we have undertaken a number of acquisitions in the last year  diversifying our product offerings and increasing our international research and development operations 
there is a risk that we will be unable to manage the growth that we have recently experienced and that we will be unable to manage our substantially larger company  including our international operations 
if we fail to manage these risks  our operating results could suffer 
we plan to continue to expand the number and breadth of our software solutions and their use in the future 
our ability to manage our planned growth effectively will require us to successfully hire  train  retain  motivate and integrate our employees  enhance and integrate our operational  financial and management systems  and expand and integrate our research and development capacity 
as we expand and diversify our product and customer base  we may be required to increase our selling  general and administrative expenses 
we also may be required to increase staffing and other expenditures in order to meet the anticipated demands of our customers 
however  given that our customers do not commit to license our software for more than a short time in advance  any increase in expenses in anticipation of future orders that do not materialize could reduce our net income 
if we are unable to match our increased staffing and other expenditures with similarly increased revenue  our profitability would be harmed 
we have a relatively new direct sales force and our limited experience in managing it may impair our ability to expand sales and generate increased revenues 
because a significant percentage of our sales force is relatively new to our company following our recent acquisitions of togethersoft and starbase  there is a limited history on which to evaluate their performance 
there can be no assurance that our expanded sales force will succeed in increasing or sustaining our revenue or improving our competitive position or that our newly hired employees will achieve desired levels of productivity 
in addition  while we have experienced sales management personnel  we have limited experience in managing a large  geographically dispersed sales force 
for example  we may experience difficulty in integrating the new members of our sales team into our operations and adequately training them on our comprehensive solutions 
our failure to successfully manage our sales force may impair our ability to increase sales and grow our revenues 
if our efforts to motivate and train our sales and technical personnel are unsuccessful or are not cost effective  our operating results would be harmed 
in light of our substantially expanded product portfolio as a result of our acquisitions  we need to extensively train and motivate our sales personnel  invest additional resources in our sales efforts and effectively 
table of contents educate our authorized resellers 
our software products and services require a sophisticated sales effort targeted at the senior management and it departments of our prospective customers 
in addition  we believe our products compare well to our competition s products in performance and other technical benefits  increasing our need to have well trained  technically savvy sales personnel in order to communicate these advantages to prospective customers 
we have made significant investments in training our direct sales force on the benefits of each component of our comprehensive solution in an effort to improve and motivate our sales force and increase sales 
in addition  following our recent acquisitions  we re allocated the territories in which our sales force operates 
there can be no assurance  however  that these efforts will be successful in achieving positive results in the long term  and such changes and additional investments could significantly increase our sales related expenses 
the number of factors that affect our revenues makes our future results for a particular period difficult to predict and therefore we may not meet expectations for a particular period 
we believe that our revenues have the potential to vary significantly from time to time 
these variations could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly 
we believe that these variations may result from many factors  including our limited experience in consistently forecasting revenues across all of our business units  particularly our newly acquired business units  the mix of channels through which we sell our products  the relative mix of demand for our various products and services  the size and timing of significant orders and their fulfillment  timing  and any delay in the introduction  of upgrades to existing products or releases of new products  the number  timing and significance of product upgrades and new product announcements by us and our competitors  changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors  customer order deferrals  product defects that may be discovered from time to time and other product quality problems  general domestic and international economic instability resulting from war with iraq  terrorist attacks or other political instability  and it and overall capital expenditure budgets of our customers and prospective customers 
a significant portion of our customers  particularly enterprise level customers  tend to place orders toward the end of a given quarter 
revenues may also fluctuate based on our customers fiscal year budgeting cycles 
therefore  revenues may be difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenues for a quarterly period may not be known until late in the quarter 
additionally  our costs  while based on projected revenues  are relatively fixed in the short term 
therefore  if our revenue levels fall below projections  net income may be significantly reduced or result in losses 
as a result  we believe that quarterly revenues and operating results will continue to be difficult to forecast and period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of trends or our future performance 
our historical financial information relating to a number of our software development technologies is based on sales of development applications for currently adopted languages and traditional hardware platforms  and as such may not be indicative of our future performance in developing and marketing software for emerging programming languages and hardware platforms 
our historical financial information relating to a number of our software development technologies is based on sales of software designed to develop applications for currently adopted platforms eg  windows and c as well as traditional computer hardware platforms eg  mainframes  work stations  applications servers  desktop personal computers  notebook computers  etc while we continue to enhance the functionality of these products 
table of contents and expect sales of these technologies to continue to generate a significant percentage of our revenues  we expect to derive an increasing percentage of our revenues from sales of our development technologies for emerging platforms such as java and 
net  as well as emerging hardware platforms such as wireless and mobile computing devices 
relative to our traditional business  we do not have a lengthy operating history in these markets upon which to evaluate our prospects  which may make it difficult to predict our actual results in future periods 
accordingly  actual results of our future operations may not meet our anticipated results 
our success is dependent on the growth of certain programming languages and standards 
many of our most popular products are focused on the java language and platform  and we continue to invest heavily in software solutions for the java platform as it evolves  including enterprise focused standards such as java platform  enterprise edition  or jee  and enterprise javabeans  or ejb  to enhance the performance and functionality of these products 
java  however  is a relatively new language and was developed primarily for the internet and corporate intranet applications 
we believe that java is making significant inroads with respect to its adoption for enterprise applications  but it is unlikely to be the only major software architecture standard that enterprises will adopt 
for example  it is expected that for the foreseeable future the java language and platform will face significant competition in the enterprise market from microsoft s more recent alternative  namely its c language and 
net platform 
if java  including ejb and jee  does not become widely adopted  our expected revenues would diminish 
in addition  our deployment products  including borland enterprise server  are based on common object request broker architecture  or corba 
corba is a standard from the object management group  or omg  for communicating between distributed objects objects are self contained software modules 
corba provides a way to execute software programs written in different programming languages running on different platforms no matter where they reside in the network 
while we believe that corba has achieved widespread acceptance as a software based communications interface through which objects are located and accessed  critics contend that its penetration tends to be narrow and deep  resulting in large investments by relatively few enterprises 
corba is a highly complex technology requiring significant investments and expertise to implement  as well as to support and train users 
if corba is displaced or its popularity is diminished  our business would be harmed 
if our development products for microsoft 
net are not successful  our business would be harmed 
we are currently investing resources in our research and development efforts for microsoft 
net development products 
microsoft 
net is microsoft s new operating environment for software applications 
while we are releasing development products that support the 
net platform  our business would be harmed if we are unable to develop an effective development product for the 
net platform that addresses the needs of our customers  or if our competitors  particularly microsoft  develop more effective or efficient products 
in addition  despite our efforts to provide effective and compatible development products for the 
net platform  customers may still elect to use an all microsoft development platform 
furthermore  the success of our 
net products is dependent upon microsoft gaining market acceptance of its 
net platform 
if microsoft s 
net platform does not gain market acceptance or gains acceptance more slowly than we anticipate  our investments in 
net compatible products may not generate their anticipated return 
in conjunction with 
net  microsoft has a new development language  c 
an alternative to java  c is an object oriented programming language and is based on c 
we believe that c is gaining in market acceptance 
we do not  however  currently offer a development product for the c programming language 
if certain emerging programming languages  such as microsoft s c  gain significantly in popularity and we do not offer a development technology to facilitate development in such languages  our competitiveness could be diminished 
we depend on technologies licensed to us by third parties  particularly those of sun microsystems and microsoft  and the loss of or inability to maintain these licenses could prevent or delay sales or shipments of certain of our products 
we are dependent on licenses from third party suppliers for some elements of our products such as various file libraries 
in particular  we are dependent on technology licenses from sun microsystems for our java 
table of contents products and we are dependent on licenses from microsoft for our delphi and c builder products 
if any of these licenses were terminated or were not renewed  or if these third parties failed to develop new technology products or failed to notify us in a timely manner of any new or updated technology  we might not be able to ship such products or provide support for such products  including upgrades 
we would then have to seek an alternative to the third party s technology and  in some cases  it is possible that an alternative may not exist 
this could result in delays in releasing and or shipping our products  increased costs or reduced functionality of our products which in turn could substantially reduce our revenues 
if we are unable to meet rapid changes in technology and introduce competitive products  our existing products could become technologically obsolete 
the market for our products is highly competitive and is characterized by continuous technological advancement  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
while we believe that to date we have successfully developed products that incorporate the latest technologies and standards  we cannot be certain that we will successfully design and market new products and upgrades of our current products that are competitive and work with existing and new computer platforms and operating environments 
this is especially true regarding the development of comprehensive solutions for the 
net platform 
additionally  we face a number of competitive risks in the software market  including  but not limited to  the following we may introduce products later than anticipated or later than competitors introductions  competitors may introduce competing products at lower prices or potentially at no cost  our products may not meet customers expectations regarding features and performance  competitors products based on new technologies or new industry standards may quickly render our existing products obsolete  the free availability of certain core new technologies may lower barriers to entry and minimize our competitive advantages on the basis of price and performance  and in order to match actions by competitors  we may need to provide product upgrades at lower prices which may result in lower margins and decreased operating results 
we may not successfully address these risks 
if we do not successfully address these risks  our business would be harmed 
if our products do not operate with the wide variety of hardware  software  operating systems  environments and programming languages used by our customers  our revenues would be harmed 
our customers use a wide variety of constantly changing hardware  software and operating platforms 
we invest and will continue to invest significant resources to develop products for new or emerging software and hardware platforms in the server  desktop  personal digital assistant  mobile  wireless and other environments that may develop from time to time 
however  there is a risk that a new hardware or software platform that we do not provide products for could rapidly grow in popularity 
in particular  we believe that this risk is substantial for particular proprietary platforms and languages for which we may not be given preferential or economically feasible access or access at all 
as a result  we may not be in a position to develop products for such platforms or may be late in doing so 
if we fail to introduce new products that address the needs of emerging market segments  or if our new products do not achieve market acceptance as a result of delays in development or other factors  our future growth and profitability could suffer 
in addition  we may incur significant expenditures to develop products for emerging platforms that do not ultimately become large or profitable market segments 
our strategic relationships may not achieve their objectives  and the failure to do so could impede our growth 
we currently maintain a number of important strategic alliances and technology relationships with industry leaders such as mercury interactive  microsoft  sun microsystems  bea systems and nokia 
our current 
table of contents technology allies give us  among other things  early access to emerging technologies and additional resources to market our products  as well as an entry point to contact potential customers 
similarly  our strategic relationships with systems integrators and resellers provide additional expertise to our customers and bolster our service capabilities 
in the future  we anticipate exploring additional strategic alliances  technology relationships and other arrangements designed to further all of these goals 
our current or prospective strategic alliances and technology relationships may not achieve their intended objectives however  and parties to our strategic alliances and technology relationships may not perform as contemplated 
additionally  our allies may choose to terminate their arrangements with us where no binding contractual arrangements exist 
under our relationship with nokia  for instance  nokia is currently recommending jbuilder as its preferred ide for java development to its customers and or vendors of ancillary products 
this arrangement is not binding  however  and nokia may choose not to recommend jbuilder at some future date or to recommend a competitor s products 
the failure to develop or maintain our strategic alliances and technology relationships  or our allies inability to perform or decision not to perform or to opt out of their arrangements with us  may impede our ability to introduce new products or enter new markets 
our international operations and sales could be harmed by factors outside our control 
a substantial portion of our revenues are from international sales 
international sales accounted for approximately of our revenues in the fiscal year ended december  in addition  following our acquisition of togethersoft  an increasing portion of our operations consist of activities outside the united states 
we now have research facilities in singapore  sweden  russia and the czech republic 
given our increasing presence in international markets and the potential for sales of our products in international markets  our business is increasingly subject to risks inherent in doing business internationally  including but not limited to the difficulty of staffing and managing an organization spread over various countries and continents  potentially reduced or less certain protection for intellectual property rights than is available under the laws of the united states and the substantial costs associated with protecting intellectual property abroad  seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and other parts of the world  delays of new product releases due to localization issues  longer payment cycles in some countries and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  restrictions on the expatriation of currency from a particular country  export restrictions  tariffs  duties and other trade barriers  changes in regulatory requirements and resulting costs  compliance with various conflicting laws and regulations  including employment laws  and resulting costs  overlap of different tax structures  terrorist activity  war and threats of war  and political or economic instability in certain parts of the world 
one or more of these risk factors could harm our future research and development operations and international sales 
in addition  our subsidiaries generally operate in local currencies and their results are translated monthly into us dollars 
if the value of the us dollar increases significantly relative to foreign currencies  our products may become more expensive to foreign businesses  and  as a result  our sales in those foreign jurisdictions may suffer 

table of contents our business may suffer if international trade is hindered  disrupted  or economically disadvantaged 
political and economic conditions abroad may harm international sales of our products 
protectionist trade legislation in either the united states or foreign countries  such as a change in the current tariff structures  export or import compliance laws or other trade policies  could adversely affect our ability to sell our software products and services in foreign markets 
trade protection measures and import and export licensing requirements subject us to additional regulation and may prevent us from shipping products to a particular market  and increase our operating costs 
in addition  we could be subject to regulations  fines and penalties for violations of import and export regulations 
such violations could result in penalties  including prohibiting us from exporting our products to one or more countries and restrictions from transacting business with the us government and instrumentalities thereof  and could adversely affect our business 
changes in policies by the us or foreign governments resulting in  among other things  higher taxation  currency conversion limitations  restrictions on the transfer of funds or the expropriation of private enterprises also could have a material adverse effect on us 
any actions by countries in which we conduct business to reverse policies that encourage foreign investment or foreign trade also could harm our international operations 
our research and development efforts may be costly and may not produce successful new products and product upgrades 
our future success will depend upon our ability to enhance our current products and develop and introduce new products on a timely basis  particularly if new technology or new industry standards render existing products obsolete 
we believe that we will need to continue to incur significant research and development expenditures to remain competitive  particularly since many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do 
the products that we are currently developing or may develop in the future may not be technologically successful or may not be accepted in our markets 
in addition  the length of our product development cycle may be greater than we expect 
if the resulting products are not introduced in a timely manner  or do not compete effectively with products of our competitors  our business will be harmed 
delays in the introduction of new products may cause us to lose customers to our competitors or harm our reputation 
from time to time  we announce when we expect to introduce a new product 
we also attempt to maintain a consistent release schedule for upgrades of existing products 
in the past  some of our products have shipped later  sometimes substantially later  than when we originally expected 
the loss of key employees may increase the risk of these delays 
some of our products are based on technology licensed from third parties 
we have limited control over when and whether these technologies are upgraded 
the failure to receive adequate notice of  the delay in release of  or the inadequacy of enhancements to  technology licensed from third parties could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop and enhance our products 
due to these uncertainties inherent in software development  it is likely that these risks will materialize from time to time in the future 
we could lose customers as a result of substantial delays in the shipment of new products or product upgrades 
because competition for qualified personnel is intense  we may not be able to recruit or retain qualified personnel  which could harm the development and licensing of our products 
we believe that our ability to successfully grow and manage our business and to develop new products will depend  in large part  on our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees  particularly highly skilled software engineers and management personnel 
over the last few years  we have increased compensation  bonuses  stock options and other fringe benefits in order to attract and retain key personnel 
in the past  some of our competitors have utilized their greater resources to provide substantial signing bonuses and other inducements to lure key personnel away from us 
as a result  we may be required to further increase cash compensation and other benefits  especially for members of management such as dale l 
fuller  our president and chief executive officer  who are almost completely vested in their options to purchase our stock 
we are not certain that these efforts will succeed in retaining our key employees  and our failure to attract and retain key personnel could 
table of contents significantly harm our business 
even if we succeed in attracting and retaining key personnel  these increased compensation costs may not be offset through either improved productivity or higher revenues 
we do not maintain key person insurance on any of our employees or management team members  including mr 
fuller 
if we lose one or more of the members of our management team  including mr 
fuller or other key employees  we will not receive insurance or other proceeds to help offset the loss to us of unique skills and talents or the potentially high cost of replacement personnel  and our business and operating results could be seriously harmed 
open source technologies lower the barrier to entry in our markets and have the potential to harm our ability to sell our products and services on profitable terms 
the free availability of technology  such as linux  may allow competitors to enter our markets more easily and at lower cost 
for example  our ability to enhance our development technologies is based on access to technologies we obtain through costly licenses with sun microsystems and microsoft  among others  providing a potential barrier to entry in our markets 
if key technologies are made freely available  the advantages we derive from our industry relationships and financial position could be diminished 
in turn  our competitive position  revenues and growth could be harmed 
if the wireless and mobile application market does not develop as anticipated our future growth may be negatively impacted 
we have introduced new java based products targeted at development applications for mobile and wireless devices  including jbuilder mobileset  jdatastore and c builder mobile edition 
we have also entered into strategic relationships or technology relationships with wireless device manufacturers  including nokia  in order to enhance our position in this market 
if the market for mobile and wireless applications does not develop as we anticipate or as quickly as we anticipate  the demand for our wireless products will be adversely impacted 
in addition  if nokia elects to cease funding our wireless development efforts  our ability to penetrate this market will be harmed 
the failure of the wireless market to develop as we expect  or our failure to penetrate this market  will impede our anticipated sales growth and could result in substantially reduced earnings from those anticipated 
the growth in the market for mobile and wireless applications will depend on a number of factors  any of which may impact our ability to derive substantial revenues from this market in the future 
these factors include but are not limited to rate of adoption of mobile devices by enterprises and consumers  including personal digital assistants  handheld computers  smart phones  pagers and other mobile devices  rate of adoption of wireless applications and services available on such devices by enterprises and consumers  success in marketing of wireless applications and services by a limited number of communication service providers  and the effect of the pricing of those application and services on market penetration  the rate of build out of  and upgrades to  existing wireless networks  including  but not limited to availability of rights to cell and switch sites  as well as zoning variances and other approvals for network construction  completion of cell site design  frequency planning and network optimization  completion of fixed network implementation  expansion of customer care  network management and billing systems  and vendor equipment availability  availability of additional radio frequency spectrum capacity to enable service providers to expand existing wireless data services and develop third generation services  and potential health issues  specifically those related to radio frequency emissions or the use of devices while driving automobiles  and resulting potential legal restrictions and or litigation 

table of contents if our products for the wireless or mobile market are not widely accepted our growth may be harmed 
in addition to the development and growth of the market itself  our ability to generate significant revenue in the wireless application implementation market will depend on our ability to adapt to the rapid technological shifts in this market to keep our products viable and competitive 
technological factors that may harm our ability to generate substantial revenue in the wireless market include but are not limited to failure of java to gain in popularity as a programming language for wireless and mobile application development  failure of a dominant platform or operating system to emerge and our corresponding ability to develop technologies that facilitate software development and deployment across the range of such technologies or any of its significant subsets  our ability to develop technologies that facilitate software development and deployment for the dominant programming languages as they occur  increasing proliferation of mobile or wireless devices with varying technical specifications and form factors  and our corresponding ability to develop products capable of facilitating development and deployment to the range of devices with such varying requirements  evolving standards and other technological changes  and the pace of overall technological change in the mobile and wireless markets 
if the wireless and mobile market does not develop as we anticipate or if we are unable to respond to technological shifts in the market  our anticipated sales could be reduced 
in addition  even if the wireless market does develop and we have competitive products  our failure to market and sell these products to our customers will harm our anticipated sales and operating results 
the success of our linux based products is dependent upon increased future adoption of linux 
we are investing time and resources in developing products  such as kylix  for the linux operating system 
linux is a relatively new operating system that runs on a variety of hardware platforms 
linux has yet to be adopted on a widespread basis  although major hardware vendors like ibm and sun microsystems are supporting it 
if linux is not adopted at the levels anticipated  or is adopted more slowly than we anticipate  our investments in linux compatible products may not generate their anticipated return 
if this occurs  we may fail to generate the revenues we expect  adversely impacting our profitability 
failure to expand or grow our professional services offerings and enlist others to provide services for our products could harm our ability to sell comprehensive solutions to enterprise customers 
we believe that growth in our licenses and other revenues will depend on our ability to provide our customers with comprehensive professional services and to enlist other parties to provide similar services  including independent software vendors  systems integrators  distributors and other channel partners 
these professional services include maintenance  architectural consulting  training  education and project management 
if we fail to attract  train and retain skilled personnel to deliver professional services  our ability to sell comprehensive solutions to enterprise customers could be seriously harmed 
competition for qualified professional services personnel is intense  and we may be unable to attract  train and retain the number of highly qualified professional services personnel that we need 
as part of our growth strategy  we have also embarked on an effort to utilize our professional services more aggressively  including using them as a means to market our products or to obtain feedback which we can then incorporate into our product plans 
a decline in the price of or demand for our professional services offerings may harm our growth strategy 

table of contents because we rely on independent software vendors  value added resellers  system integrators and other channel partners to compliment our direct sales  if we cease doing business with one or more of these parties  our revenues could suffer 
we rely on independent software vendors  or isvs  value added resellers  or vars  systems integrators and other channel partners to compliment our direct sales 
a part of our strategy is also to bundle our software in the products offered by vars or isvs 
the pricing  terms and conditions of our agreements with these partners are individually negotiated and vary among partners 
a majority of these agreements are non exclusive 
many of our agreements do not require our customers to make a minimum number of purchases 
we have virtually no control over the shipping dates or volumes of systems shipped by our customers 
although we believe our relationships with our channel partners have been successful to date  we cannot guarantee that these relationships will continue to be successful or grow or that the channel partners will continue to purchase our products at the anticipated levels in the future 
if we do not continue to receive referrals from third parties or if we are unable to secure license agreements with these parties on profitable terms  our business may suffer 
if we cannot increase market awareness of our products and services our business could be harmed 
we continue to expand our marketing operations in order to increase market awareness of our products and services  enhance the goodwill associated with the borland brand  market our products and services to a greater number of customers and generate increased revenue 
our products and services increasingly require effective marketing efforts to address the various departments of an enterprise  as well as the developer community at large  and our inability to effectively market our products could impede our ability to compete 
in addition  the need to engage in these marketing efforts could result in a significant increase in our expenses 
we depend on a small number of distributors like ingram micro for a significant portion of our revenues  if we lose one or any of our major distributors our revenues could suffer 
ingram micro  one of our major distributors  accounted for approximately of our total net revenues during the year ended december  and of total net revenues during the year ended december  we expect that ingram micro will continue to be a significant distributor and a small number of distributors will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
our inability to increase the number of our distributors or the loss of any one major distributor like ingram micro could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or could cause our revenues to drop quickly and unexpectedly 
we are dependent upon certain retail distribution channels 
if these retailers cease to carry our products our revenues would be harmed 
our license revenues made through retail distribution channels is subject to events that cause unpredictability in customer demand 
our retail distributors also carry the products of our competitors 
some of our retail distributors have limited shelf space and limited capital to invest in inventory 
their decision to purchase our products is based on a combination of demand for our products  our pricing  the terms and special promotions we offer and other factors that we do not control and cannot predict 
our agreements with retail distributors are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated by them or us without cause 
accordingly  our distributors may not continue to carry our products which would harm our revenue prospects 
we may incur future impairment losses related to intangible assets from prior acquisitions which could negatively affect our future operating results 
we have recently acquired significant assets and businesses 
if the assets and businesses do not perform as expected  substantial quantities of intangible assets may need to be amortized or written off 
to the extent the assets cannot be amortized  we may be required to take impairment charges related to the intangible assets from these acquisitions 
such charges could harm our operating results 

table of contents we have net operating loss and credit carryforwards that may change our effective tax rate and in turn have a material effect on our income 
our effective tax rate is primarily dependent on the location of our taxable profits  if any  due to our net operating loss carryforwards in certain  but not all  jurisdictions  and the imposition of withholding taxes on revenues regardless of our profitability 
we have significant us federal and state income tax net operating losses 
for us federal and state income tax purposes  we have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million at december   respectively 
we also have available us federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
these loss and credit carryforwards expire between and  if not utilized 
utilization of federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before full utilization 
we also have approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards in various foreign jurisdictions 
certain of these loss carryforwards will expire beginning in to the extent we are unable to utilize these loss and credit carryforwards  our effective tax rate will rise 
a higher effective tax rate may harm our future after tax income 
legislative actions may cause our operating expenses to increase 
the sarbanes oxley act of  the california disclosure act and newly proposed or enacted rules and regulations of the sec or nasdaq  impose new duties on us and our executives  directors  attorneys and auditors 
in order to comply with the sarbanes oxley act and any new rules promulgated by the sec or nasdaq  we may be required to hire additional personnel and use additional outside legal  accounting and advisory services 
any of these developments could materially increase our operating expenses and  accordingly  reduce our net income 
potential new accounting pronouncements may cause our net income to decrease 
we currently account for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion number  accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and have not recognized any compensation expense for awards of employee stock options in the fiscal years ended december   and statement of financial accounting standard number  accounting for stock based compensation permits us to continue accounting for stock based compensation as set forth in apb  provided we disclose the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share of using a fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation plans 
had we recorded compensation costs based on the estimated grant date fair value  as defined by sfas  for awards granted under our stock option and stock purchase plans  our pro forma net income and earnings per share for the years ended december   and would have been as follows amounts in thousands  expect per share data year ended december  net income loss as reported stock compensation expense  net of tax pro forma net income loss per share as reported basic as reported diluted pro forma basic pro forma diluted 
table of contents if we change our method of accounting for employee stock options in the future  whether voluntarily or as a result of changes in accounting rules  it could materially decrease our net income 
if our encryption technology does not satisfy our potential customers needs for the confidential transfer of information  sales of certain of our deployment products could suffer 
we use and will continue to use encryption technology licensed by third parties in some of our products  such as in borland enterprise server  to provide security for the exchange of our customers confidential information 
encryption technologies have been breached in the past 
there can be no assurance that there will not be a compromise or breach of our security technology 
if such a breach were to occur  it could harm our reputation and sales of our deployment products 
if the license of our products that contain encryption technology is delayed by export regulations  revenues from licensing some of our products in foreign markets could be harmed 
there are numerous regulations regarding the export of encryption technology from the united states 
in the past  some of our sales have been delayed while we have awaited regulatory clearance to export our encryption technology  especially to countries outside the european union 
similar delays in the future would reduce our revenues 
our products may contain unknown defects that could result in a loss of revenues  decreased market acceptance  injury to our reputation and product liability claims 
software products occasionally contain errors or defects  especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released 
we have not experienced any substantial problems to date from potential defects and errors  but we cannot assure you that our products are or in the future will be completely free of defects and errors 
errors in our software may be caused by defects in third party software incorporated into our products 
if so  we may be unable to fix these defects without the cooperation of these software providers 
because these defects may not be as significant to our software providers as they are to us  we may not receive the full and timely cooperation that we may require 
in addition  we may not have the contractual right to access the source code of third party software and  even if we access the source code  we may be unable to detect and fix the defect 
the discovery of a defect or error in a new version or product may result in the following consequences  among others delayed shipping of the product  delay in market acceptance  diversion of development resources  damage to our reputation  and increased service and warranty costs 
these consequences could decrease our revenues 
our products also interoperate with many components of complicated computer system implementations  such as mainframes  application servers  personal computers  application software  databases  operating systems and data transformation software 
failure of any one of these components could cause all or large portions of computer systems to fail 
in such circumstances  it may be difficult to determine which software or hardware component failed  and it is likely that customers would bring a lawsuit against several companies  including us 
regardless of its merits  responding to any claim can be time consuming and costly and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
in addition  we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims or our insurance coverage for these types of claims may not be adequate 

table of contents many of our license agreements contain provisions designed to limit our liability for potential product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that these provisions may not protect us because of existing or future federal  state  local or foreign laws or ordinances or judicial decisions 
a successful product liability claim for large damages brought against us could reduce our profitability 
intentional efforts to harm or disrupt the functioning of our software or website could harm our reputation and result in significant unexpected costs 
our products or services may be the target of intentional disruptions  such as software viruses specifically designed to impede the performance of our products 
similarly  experienced computer programmers or hackers may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our website and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions to the delivery of our services or products 
our activities could be substantially disrupted  and our reputation and future sales could be harmed if these efforts were successful 
the price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly 
like the publicly traded securities of other high technology companies  the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly

table of contents sales of our common stock by significant stockholders may cause the price of our common stock to decrease 
several outside investors in borland own significant portions of our common stock 
for example  based on their most recent schedule g filings with the sec  merrill lynch and co  inc indicated that it owned of our common stock  fmr corp 
owned of our common stock  franklin resources  inc indicated that it owned of our common stock and microsoft corporation indicated that it owned of our common stock 
further  of the  shares of common stock we issued in connection with our acquisition of togethersoft  a total of  shares were issued to object international  inc and dietrich charisius  two former stockholders of togethersoft 
these  shares are subject to restrictions on their resale until january  if these stockholders were to sell significant amounts of their borland stock  then the market price of our stock could be negatively impacted 
the effect of such sales  or of significant portions of our stock being offered or made available for sale  could result in downward pressure on our stock 
investors should be aware that they could experience significant short term volatility in our stock if such stockholders decide to sell a substantial amount of their borland stock at once or within a short period of time 
we may become subject to costly and time consuming class action and or stockholder derivative litigation following significant changes in our stock price 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies 
were such litigation to be commenced against us  we could incur substantial costs and there would be diversion of our management s attention and resources  which could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our investments in securities of other companies may not yield any returns 
any investment losses or other expenses related to these investments could harm our operating results for a particular period 
from time to time  we may make investments in equity and or debt securities of other companies that we believe further our strategic objectives 
our ability to recover our investments in non marketable equity and debt securities and to earn a return on these investments is dependent  in part  on how successfully these companies are able to execute on their business plans  as well as their ability to obtain venture capital funding to continue operations and to grow 
in the current equity market environment  their ability to obtain additional funding as well as to take advantage of liquidity events  such as initial public offerings  mergers and private sales  is significantly constrained 
as a result  we may not be able to recover the initial amount invested in these companies 
in the event that our investments in these or other debt or equity securities do not prove successful  our operating results may be harmed 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  we may lose valuable assets 
as a software company  our intellectual property rights are among our most valuable assets 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret laws  domain name registrations  confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements and other methods to protect our intellectual property rights  but these measures may provide only limited protection 
the protective steps we have taken may be inadequate to protect our intellectual property rights  particularly overseas  or deter misappropriations thereof 
in addition  it may be possible for an unauthorized third party to reverse engineer or decompile our software products 
we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of  or take appropriate steps to enforce  our intellectual property rights  particularly in certain international markets 
litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights  and such litigation can be time consuming and expensive 
we have issued us patents  issued foreign patents and approximately additional pending applications for us patents and approximately pending applications for foreign patents 
it is possible that some or all of our patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
it is also possible that our pending patent applications may never result in issued patents  and if they do result in issued patents  those patents may be invalidated 
in addition  effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable  costly or limited in some foreign countries  making the possibility of 
table of contents misappropriation of our intellectual property more likely 
current laws in the united states that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software pirates  and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection in this respect 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  expensive and time consuming and we expect that software piracy will be a persistent problem for all software products 
in addition  the unique technology of the internet may tend to increase and provide new methods for illegal copying and distribution of intellectual property 
accordingly  we cannot be certain that we will be able to protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized third party copying or use 
this could harm our competitive position 
we may incur substantial expenses and divert management resources in prosecuting others for their unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights 
in the future  we may need to file lawsuits to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
this litigation  whether successful or unsuccessful  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 
in addition  should any of our competitors file patent applications or obtain patents that claim inventions also claimed by us  we may choose to participate in an interference proceeding to determine the right to a patent for these inventions 
even if the outcome is favorable  this proceeding could result in substantial cost to us and disrupt our business 
third party claims of intellectual property infringement may subject us to costly litigation or settlement terms or limited sales of our products 
from time to time  we have received notices claiming that we have infringed a third party s patent or other intellectual property right 
we expect that software products in general will increasingly be subject to these claims as the number of products and competitors increase  the functionality of products overlap and as the patenting of software functionality becomes more widespread 
further  the receipt of a notice alleging infringement may require in some situations that a costly opinion of counsel be obtained to prevent an allegation of intentional infringement 
regardless of its merits  responding to any claim can be time consuming and costly and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel from productive tasks 
in the event of a successful claim against us  we may be required to pay significant monetary damages  including treble damages if we are held to have willfully infringed  discontinue use and sale of the infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology and or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that might not be offered or be available on acceptable terms 
if a successful claim were made against us and we failed to commercially develop or license a substitute technology  our business could be harmed 
in addition  we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims or our insurance coverage for these types of claims may not be adequate 
increasing regulation of the internet  imposition of sales and other taxes on products sold or distributed over the internet and privacy concerns relating to the internet could harm our business 
our future sales and any future profits will be substantially dependent upon the continued widespread acceptance and use of the internet by consumers and businesses as an effective medium for exchanging information and conducting business 
to be successful  consumers and businesses that historically have used traditional means of commerce to transact business must continue to accept and utilize the internet as a medium for conducting business and exchanging information 
consumers and businesses may eventually reject the internet as a viable commercial medium for a number of reasons  including potentially inadequate network infrastructure  slow development of enabling technologies such as broadband or other technologies that enable rapid download of purchased products  insufficient commercial support and privacy and security concerns 
in addition  delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity could cause the internet to lose its viability as a commercial medium 
the electronic commerce market is relatively new and rapidly evolving 
while this is an evolving area of the law in the united states and overseas  currently there are relatively few laws or regulations that directly apply 
table of contents to commerce on the internet 
changes in laws or regulations governing the internet and electronic commerce  including  without limitation  those governing an individual s privacy rights  pricing  content  encryption  security  acceptable payment methods and quality of products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
taxation of internet commerce  or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations may also be imposed 
laws and regulations applying to the solicitation  collection and processing of personal or consumer information could also be enacted 
any of these regulations could result in a decline in the use or popularity of the internet as a medium for commerce  which could harm our future sales and revenue growth 
our charter documents and delaware law could discourage an acquisition of our company  even if an acquisition might be viewed as beneficial to our stockholders 
our stockholder rights plan  and certain provisions in each of our restated certificate of incorporation  amended and restated bylaws and the delaware general corporation law may discourage  delay or prevent an actual or potential change in control of our company even if that change in control could be beneficial to and in the best interests of our stockholders 
this could limit our stockholders ability to approve a transaction that they may deem to be in their best interests 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority  without stockholder approval  to fix the rights and preferences of  and issue shares of one or more series of preferred stock 
in october  we adopted a new stockholder rights plan  which replaced an existing plan that expired in december  to protect our stockholders in the event of a proposed takeover that has not been recommended or approved by our board of directors 
under our current stockholder rights plan  each share of our outstanding common stock has attached to it one preferred share purchase right 
each preferred share purchase right entitles the holder  other than the acquiring person or entity  under certain circumstances  to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount from its then current market price 
our corporate headquarters is located in northern california  which is susceptible to earthquakes 
our corporate headquarters and a substantial portion of our research and development operations are currently located in northern and southern california  areas known for significant seismic activity 
seismic activity  such as a major earthquake  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we currently do not have a formal disaster recovery plan nor do we currently maintain property and casualty insurance coverage for seismic activity 
additionally  we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for any losses that we may sustain as a result of any seismic activity

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  as well as credit risk concentrations 
to address the foreign currency exchange rate risk we enter into various hedging transactions as described below 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency risk we transact business in various foreign countries and have established a foreign currency hedging program utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge intercompany balances and other monetary assets denominated in non functional currencies 
the goal of the hedging program is to offset the earnings impact of non functional currency balances 
we do not use foreign currency forward exchange contracts for trading purposes 
at month end  short term non functional currency balances and the forward exchange contracts are marked to market and unrealized gains and losses are included in current period net income 
during the year ended december   we recorded net foreign exchange losses of million 
the foreign exchange losses were generated primarily due to the strength of the us dollar relative to the brazilian 
table of contents real and the strength of the euro relative to the us dollar 
it is uncertain whether these currency trends will continue 
if these currency trends continue  we may experience foreign exchange losses on our intercompany receivables and other non functional currency monetary assets and liabilities to the extent that we have not hedged the exposure with foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
these foreign exchange losses could have a material adverse affect on our operating results and cash flows 
during the year ending december   we recorded a foreign currency loss of approximately million as a part of other comprehensive income due to foreign currency movements on our long term intercompany balances 
as of december   we had million  million and million in long term intercompany balances that will be settled in australian dollars  singapore dollars and brazilian reales  respectively 
we had no derivative financial instruments or foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding as of december  interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of financial instruments such as commercial paper 
by corporate policy  we limit the amount of our credit exposure to million to any one commercial issuer 
we mitigate default risk by investing in securities rated at least a p as published by standard and poors and moodys and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in the credit rating of any investment issuer 
our portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary and resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity

our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions and commercial paper 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require collateral
