these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from its expectations 
such risks and uncertainties include those discussed in this report under business risk factors 
overview on assignment  inc is a leading provider of skilled temporary professionals to clients in the science and healthcare industries 
we provide clients in these markets with short term or long term assignments of temporary professionals and temporary to permanent placement of these professionals 
our business consists of two operating segments healthcare staffing and lab support 
through our healthcare staffing segment  we are able to offer our clients temporary professionals  both locally based and traveling  from more than ten healthcare and medical financial occupations 
these temporary professional specialties include nurses  specialty nurses  surgical technicians  imaging technicians  x ray technicians  medical technicians  cytotechnologists  phlebotomists  coding  billing  claims processing and collections staff 
through our lab support segment  we service the domestic and international markets for science professionals and provide temporary and permanent placement of scientific personnel to industrial laboratories in the biotechnology  pharmaceutical  food and beverage  chemical  and environmental industries 
healthcare staffing segment revenues represented approximately percent of our total revenues for  up from percent in the significant increase in our healthcare staffing segment revenues was principally due to our acquisition of health personnel options corporation hpo in april through this acquisition we were able to increase our participation in the growing travel nurse industry  and we increased the number of temporary employees for our healthcare staffing segment from approximately  to  as of april in addition to our acquisition and integration of hpo  we made significant internal upgrades to our business and infrastructure in in july  we reorganized our lab support segment to increase the efficiency of our field management and address organization  productivity and compensation issues 
these changes enabled us to avoid a significant performance decline of our lab support segment despite a depressed demand environment  particularly for biotechnology related services  which represented approximately of our domestic assignments made in our lab support business in in november  we completed the reorganization of our healthcare staffing segment to more closely align our product offering with the needs of our clients and prospective clients 
in december  we initiated a nurse retention program to reduce our holiday attrition rate and better support our clients 
during  we also undertook a significant upgrade of our systems infrastructure  transitioning our functionality to an enterprise wide information system utilizing peoplesoft software 
while these changes resulted in increased expenses and lower gross margins  we believe that going forward these changes will enable us to better execute our business strategy  reduce our costs and drive efficiency and productivity throughout the organization 
in addition to our infrastructure investments above  we have undertaken and continue to explore cost rationalization strategies that we believe will yield more productive and cost effective operations 
we have reviewed and continue to assess our operations  including the performance of our branch offices in certain markets 
as a result of such a review  we are in the process of winding down our operations in canada and ireland 
our efforts to streamline our organization and better align our resources and cost structure with our near term opportunities may include  but are not limited to  further office closures  workforce reductions and reallocation of our personnel resources 
these actions may result in increased severance costs  legal and outplacement fees and may cause us to incur a restructuring charge during the period when such cost containment efforts are taken 
due to a shortage of qualified nurses and low barriers to entry  we continue to see increased competition in the travel nurse business  particularly from local start up companies 
in recent quarters  we have encountered price competition among temporary staffing companies in the travel nurse business 
intensification of or the continuation of price competition in the markets in which we operate could reduce our margins and negatively affect our revenues and market share 
seasonality our results of operations have historically been subject to seasonal fluctuations 
demand for our temporary professionals typically declines from the year end holiday season through february  resulting in a corresponding decrease in revenues  operating income and net income in the first quarter 
demand for our temporary professionals also often declines in june  july and august due to decreases in clients activity during vacation periods and the availability of students to perform temporary work 
as a result  we have also experienced slower growth or declines in revenues  operating income and net income during the second quarter to third quarter 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables based on our analysis of specific accounts and historical collection experiences applied to the remaining general accounts 
for specific accounts  we use our judgment  based on available facts and circumstances  to record a specific reserve for that customer against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected 
for the remaining general accounts  a general reserve is established based on a range of percentages applied to aging categories 
these percentages are based on historical collection experience 
if circumstances change  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could change by a material amount 
accrued workers compensation 
we are partially self insured for workers compensation expense 
the workers compensation program covers all of our temporary professionals and regular employees 
in connection with this program  we pay a base premium plus actual losses incurred up to certain levels and are insured for losses greater than certain levels per occurrence and in the aggregate 
the self insurance claim liability is determined based on claims filed and claims incurred but not reported 
in order to ensure that the accrued workers compensation balance is adequate to cover all costs incurred under our workers compensation program  at the end of each fiscal quarter  an actuarial report is prepared by an independent third party who calculates our self insurance claim liability based on historical experience and trends of industry data 
if historical experiences and industry trends change  the self insurance claim liability calculated by the third party actuary could change by a material amount 
contingencies 
we account for contingencies in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
fas no 
requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as legal and workers compensation matters requires us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate  if the actual loss from a loss contingency is significantly different than the estimated loss  results of operations may be over or understated 
goodwill and identifiable intangibles 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report  we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets as of january  fas no 
requires  subsequent to january   that we review and test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis  rather than amortize them 
we may be required to review and test for impairment more frequently if an event occurs that indicates that the assets may be impaired 
in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill  fas requires us to allocate goodwill to our various businesses to which the acquired goodwill relates  estimate the fair value of those businesses to which goodwill relates  and determine the carrying value of the businesses 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value for a particular business  then we are required to estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of the business  in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business 
this requires independent valuations of certain internally generated and previously unrecognized intangible assets 
when this process is completed  the amount of goodwill impairment will be determined 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the businesses with recognized goodwill for the purposes of our financial statements  we made estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these businesses 
our cashflow forecasts were based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
in addition  we made certain judgments about allocating shared assets and liabilities such as accounts receivable and accrued workers compensation to the estimated balance sheet for those businesses 
we also considered our market capitalization on january  per share and december  per share  representing the dates of our impairment tests under fas  in determining the fair value of the respective businesses 
based on our best estimates  we have concluded that there is no impairment of our goodwill at december  however  changes in these estimates or our market capitalization could cause one or more of the businesses to be valued differently 
for example  during the first quarter of  while our long term business projections did not materially change  we experienced a significant decline in our market capitalization 
during the first half of  if our market capitalization does not recover to the levels of december approximately million  we may need to perform another impairment analysis 
this analysis could potentially result in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of up to approximately million  which is the entire goodwill balance at december  the amount of goodwill impairment will depend upon the estimated value of the businesses to which the goodwill relates and the value of the other assets and liabilities attributed to those businesses at that time 
results of operations the following table summarizes  for the periods indicated  selected statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenues year ended december  unaudited revenues cost of services gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income years ended december  and revenues

the healthcare staffing segment s cost of services as a percentage of segment revenues increased by percent from percent in the period to percent in the period 
this increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of hpo  which has a higher cost of services than the other divisions within the healthcare staffing segment  partially offset by a percent decrease in temporary professionals compensation and payroll taxes  a percent decrease in employer paid benefits and a percent decrease in workers compensation expense

provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes decreased percent from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  our effective tax rate increased from percent in period to percent in the period

net income decreased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources the change in our liquidity during the year ended december  is the net effect of funds generated by operations  offset by funds used in investing activities  primarily funds used for the acquisition of hpo see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and funds used for financing activities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of business  principally risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations 
we are exposed to interest rate risk from our held to maturity investments 
the interest rate risk is immaterial due to the short maturity of the majority of these investments 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk from the translation of foreign operations into us dollars 
based on the relative size and nature of our foreign operations  we do not believe that a ten percent change in foreign currencies would have a material impact on our financial statements
