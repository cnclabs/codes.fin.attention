item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk introduction this management s discussion and analysis md a primarily reviews the financial condition and results of operations of community bank system  inc  and its subsidiaries for the past two years  although in some circumstances a period longer than two years is covered in order to comply with securities and exchange commission disclosure requirements or to more fully explain long term trends 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial information on pages and and the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear on pages through all references in the discussion to financial condition and results of operations are to the consolidated position and results of the company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole 
unless otherwise noted  all earnings per share eps figures disclosed in the md a refer to diluted eps 
all financial results reflect the acquisition of first liberty bank corp 
first liberty in accordance with pooling of interest accounting  unless otherwise noted 
all references to peer banks  unless otherwise noted  pertain to a group of bank holding companies nationwide having billion to billion in assets and their associated composite financial results for the nine months ending september  the most recently available disclosure as provided by the federal reserve system 
lastly  unless otherwise noted  the term this year refers to results in calendar year this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain forward looking statements with respect to the financial condition  results of operations and business of community bank system  inc cbsi or the company 
these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties 
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements are set herein under the caption forward looking statements on page accounting policies as a result of the complex and dynamic nature of the company s business  management must exercise judgement in selecting and applying the most appropriate accounting policies for its various areas of operations 
the policy decision process not only ensures compliance with the latest generally accepted accounting principles  but also reflects on management s discretion with regard to choosing the most suitable methodology for reporting the company s financial performance 
it is management s opinion that the accounting estimates covering certain aspects of the business have more significance than others due to the relative importance of those areas to overall performance  or the level of subjectivity in the selection process 
management believes that these areas include the allowance for loan losses  fair value of investment securities  fair value methodologies used to review the carrying value of goodwill  and actuarial assumptions associated with the pension  post retirement and other employee benefit plans 
the accounting policies for the first three items are disclosed in note a summary of significant accounting policies starting on page pension  post retirement and other benefits assumptions are reported in note k on pages and it is important to review all accounting policies in note a in order to better understand the performance of cbsi as reported in this document 
net income and profitability net income for the year ended december  was million  up million or from the prior year 
earnings per share of were higher than the earned in results for both years include nonrecurring costs associated with the company s three acquisitions in january  may  and november  which added billion in assets and expanded its branch network by see note b pages for a description of the fleetboston financial fleetboston  citizens national bank of malone citizens  and first liberty bank corp 
first liberty or flib acquisitions 
acquisition and unusual expenses associated with these transactions reduced earnings by per share in and in this difference explains of the improvement in eps between the two years 
the results include the benefit of adopting sfas  an accounting standard that eliminates the regular amortization of goodwill related to the company s branch acquisitions  and sfas  which eliminates the requirement to regularly amortize approximately million in goodwill related to its whole company acquisitions 
sfas and sfas were effective january  and increased current year earnings per share by and  respectively 
net income and earnings per share for the year ended december  were million and  down and  respectively  from results 
the net income decline was primarily driven by acquisition related expenses 
in  non recurring acquisition expenses rose million to million  and intangible amortization expense was up million due to the significant goodwill and deposit intangibles added as a result of the acquisitions that were recorded under the purchase method of accounting citizens and fleetboston 
earnings per share declined by a higher percentage than net income because of higher weighted average diluted shares outstanding 
 common shares were issued in conjunction with the company s january whole bank purchase of citizens national bank of malone  and million shares were issued in the fourth quarter of to partially fund the mid november purchase of branches from fleetboston financial 
performance as measured by operating earnings  which exclude acquisition and unusual expenses and various securities transactions related to acquisitions  is considered by some securities analysts to be a more accurate reflection of the underlying core earnings strength of a company 
cbsi s operating earnings per share for were  up from the prior year s level of 
excluding the aforementioned benefits from adopting sfas and in  operating earnings per share of this year were higher than the operating eps generated in the resulting improvement largely reflects the full year impact of the fleetboston branch acquisition  improved margins  a larger securities portfolio and a lower effective income tax rate 
cbsi has also historically reported its performance using another measure of earnings power cash earnings 
now that sfas and sfas have been adopted  this metric has been redefined to exclude from earnings the expense of regularly amortizing core deposit intangibles cdi 
cdi represents the premium the company has paid for deposits acquired in excess of the cost incurred had the funds been purchased in the capital markets 
amortization of cdi is a non cash expense  and adding it back tax adjusted to reported earnings creates the cash earnings metric 
cash earnings are believed by some securities analysts to be a better measure of a company s ability to build capital  fund expansion  and pay shareholder dividends 
cbsi s cash operating earnings per share for were  up from the prior year

the primary factors explaining performance are discussed in detail in the remaining sections of this document and are summarized as follows o as shown in table above  net interest income full tax equivalent basis increased or million due to a million increase in average earning assets and a basis point improvement in the net interest margin 
the relative contribution of higher volumes and better margins was about equal versus  respectively 
the interest margin benefited from the rates on deposits and borrowings declining more rapidly than the yields earned on loans and investments in a falling rate environment 
average loans grew million while average investments rose million 
the growth in earning assets was funded by million more average deposits and million more average borrowings 
the growth in average loans and deposits was mostly attributable to the acquisition of the fleetboston branches in november branches after consolidation with existing cbsi branches 
o noninterest income including net investment security gains and loss on losses on debt extinguishment increased by million from to million 
general banking fees accounted for million of the improvement  as service income and the volume of overdrafts increased due to the additional fleetboston branches 
overdraft fee income also benefited from a mid year increase of the fee charged for overdrafts and the implementation of the overdraft freedomtm program described in noninterest income section on pages 
financial services revenues were million higher due to strong growth at the company s broker dealer business  community investment services  inc cisi  and at the company s pension administration and consulting subsidiary  benefits plans administrative services bpa 
million of gains on the sale of debt instruments offset by a  prepayment penalty on the early retirement of debt resulted in million higher income from net security transactions in excluding net security transactions  noninterest income increased for the eighth consecutive year to million in  a million improvement over o noninterest expense or overhead including acquisition and unusual expenses rose million or in to million 
excluding acquisition and unusual expenses in both years  operating expenses rose million or 
ongoing overhead expense increased due to the full year impact of the company s mid november acquisition of the fleetboston branches 
in addition  incremental costs were temporarily incurred as a result of consolidating the bank s regional loan and deposit operations centers into two centralized locations 
efficiency steadily improved in as integration of the acquisitions and the benefits of streamlined operations were more fully realized in the second half of the year 
o loan loss provision increased million or from s level 
the full year loan loss provision covered total actual net charge offs by times 
net charge offs as a percent of average loans rose basis points in to 
the primary reason for the overall increase in charge offs is the impact of the softening economy in the markets we serve  including partial charge offs on two larger commercial customers in the second quarter of and charge off of the remaining balance of one these customers in the fourth quarter 
the increase in the loan loss provision reflects the higher net charge offs  a rise in specific commercial allowance for loan loss allocations and the annual year end change in the historical periods used as a basis for general reserve allocations 
nonperforming loans increased during to of loans outstanding at year end compared to one year earlier  reflecting the weak economy 
additional information on trends and policy related to asset quality is provided in the asset quality section on pages o the company s combined effective federal and state tax rate decreased percentage points in to  primarily as a result of an increased proportion of tax exempt municipal investment holdings and higher reported pre tax income due to the adoptions of sfas and sfas selected profitability and other measures return on average assets  return on average equity  dividend payout and equity to asset ratios for the years indicated are as follows table selected ratios at december  percentage of net income to average total assets percentage of net income operating to average total assets percentage of net income to average shareholders equity percentage of net income operating to average shareholders equity percentage of dividends declared per common share to net income per share percentage of dividends declared per common share to net income operating per share percentage of average shareholders equity to average total assets operating adjusted amounts and ratios exclude the after tax effect of acquisition and unusual expenses  and for  net investment security gains losses and loss on early retirement of long term borrowings  and accordingly  are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
as displayed in table above  return on average assets improved in in comparison to both and this was primarily a result of substantially higher net interest margins and improved operational efficiencies 
significantly improved profitability resulted in a higher return on equity in versus however  the build up of equity capital over the last two years from the retention of net profits and common share offerings in conjunction with the company s acquisitions led to a lower return on equity in than  despite higher net income 
the strengthening of the company s equity capital position is also reflected in the and basis point increases in the average equity to average total assets ratios in and  respectively 
the dividend payout ratio spiked temporarily in due to lower earnings as a result of acquisition related expenses  an increased number of shares  and the full year impact of a per share increase in the dividend in the third quarter of the dividend payout ratio for was below the level as a result of net income growing at a higher compounded annual growth rate than dividends during this period 
this reflects management s emphasis on enhancing the company s capital position to support future internal and external growth 
net interest income net interest income is the amount that interest and fees on earning assets loans and investments exceeds the cost of funds  primarily interest paid to the bank s depositors  interest on capital market borrowings  and dividends paid on the company s trust preferred stock 
net interest margin is the difference between the gross yield on earning assets and the cost of interest bearing funds as a percentage of earning assets 
as disclosed in table  net interest income with non taxable income converted to a full tax equivalent basis totaled million in  this represents a million or increase over the prior year 
the increase was due to improved margins and net increase in interest bearing balances  which had positive impacts of million and million on net interest income  respectively 
as shown in tables and  gross interest income on loans and investments grew by million or in as a result of million higher average earning assets  which contributed million  partially offset by million related to lower rates 
average loans grew a total of million in  with the most significant portion occurring as a result of the november acquisition of million of loans associated with the fleetboston branches 
interest and fees on loans decreased  or 
a basis point drop in yields due to falling capital market rates had more of an impact negative million than growth in average loans positive million 
despite a falling rate environment  the steepening yield curve in the first half of resulted in widening spreads for investments over cost of funds 
this situation created favorable opportunities to expand the company s investment portfolio  which was increased million in the first quarter and million in the second quarter on an average balance basis 
this expansion was primarily funded through external borrowings 
the investment portfolio was held relatively flat in the third quarter  and in the fourth quarter of management decided to allow the investment portfolio to run off  using the proceeds to pay down borrowings due to the lack of investment opportunities offering acceptable yields 
as a result of the aforementioned portfolio activity as well as increased investments in the fourth quarter of  average balances for increased by million over the year earlier period 
investment interest income full tax equivalent basis in was million or higher than the prior year as a result of the larger portfolio positive million impact  partially offset by a decrease in the average investment yield from to negative million impact  which was driven by declining yields on taxable investment securities 
this decrease was primarily due to purchases of taxable investments in a declining market rate environment in late and early to replace run off and increase the overall size of the portfolio 
the yields on tax exempt securities increased by basis points in despite falling interest rates as a result of the purchase of intermediate term municipal securities that offered attractive yields and lengthened the average life of the portfolio 
the drop in the average yield on the total investment portfolio was mostly due to the decrease of taxable investment yields  which more than offset the impact of the improved yield and higher mix in versus in of non taxable investments 
the average earning asset yield fell basis points to in because of the previously mentioned decrease in investment and loan yields and a reduced proportion of loans to earning assets  which decreased on average from in to in this decline in loan mix is a consequence of the favorable investment opportunities outlined above as well as tempered loan growth due to continued weak economic conditions 
total average fundings deposits and borrowings grew by million in  with million of the increase coming from deposits  mostly attributable to acquisition of the fleetboston branches  and million from increased capital market borrowings 
the additional capital market borrowings primarily came from the issuance of approximately million in floating rate trust preferred securities in mid in anticipation of the fleetboston branch acquisition 
total interest expense decreased by million to million in lower market rates resulted in million less interest expense  with higher average interest bearing funds offsetting this by million 
interest expense as a percentage of earning assets  fell by percentage points to 
the rate on interest bearing deposits fell percentage points to  due largely to steady declines in time deposit rates throughout and periodic reduction of rates on other interest bearing deposit products 
the rate on capital market borrowings declined percentage points to because of substantially lower market rates  particularly on short term and variable rate funding 
cbsi s net interest margin full tax equivalent basis increased by basis points from in to this year 
the percentage point decrease in the rate on average interest bearing funds had a greater impact than the basis point decline in the yield on interest earning assets 
the net interest margin increased in every quarter of  ending with a margin for the fourth quarter  as shown in table downward repricing of the company s interest bearing deposits and falling market rates on external borrowings combined with a relatively stable yield on the investment portfolio led to the improvement in the net interest margin over the course of the year 
the company s net interest margin ranked in the favorable th peer bank percentile for the nine months ending september  the following table sets forth certain information concerning average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the yields and rates thereon for the years ended december   and interest income and resultant yield information in the tables are on a fully tax equivalent basis using a marginal federal income tax rate of

changes due to volume and rate are computed from the respective changes in average balances and rates of the totals  they are not a summation of the changes of the components 
as previously mentioned  the fourth quarter net interest margin was the highest of the year  basis points greater than the margin for the corresponding prior year period 
this improvement was driven by the drop in the cost of funds having a greater impact than falling yields on loans and investments  and larger growth in average interest earning assets than in average interest bearing liabilities  as demonstrated in table above 
the latter factor was primarily a result of the significant amount of non interest bearing deposits acquired in the fleetboston branch acquisition in mid november economic and market conditions and the maturity and interest rate sensitivity profile of the company s balance sheet continuously change 
therefore  fourth quarter results are not necessarily indicative of future performance 
noninterest income the company s sources of noninterest income are of three primary types general banking services related to loans  deposits and other core customer activities typically provided through the branch network  financial services  comprised of personal trust  employee benefit trust  investment  and insurance products  and periodic transactions  most often net gains losses from the sale of investments or other occasional events

deposit related fee income benefited significantly from the acquisition of the fleetboston branches 
combined revenues  excluding transactions related to investment securities  debt and the disposal of branch properties  rose for the eighth consecutive year to million in  a million or improvement over noninterest income  excluding net gains losses from the sale of securities  early retirement of debt and disposal of branch properties and other unusual items  as a percent of operating income was in  a decrease of percentage points from the prior year 
this decline was primarily driven by the aforementioned strong growth in net interest income and the adverse effect of unfavorable equity market conditions on the financial service businesses  particularly the company s asset manager  elias asset management  and the personal trust unit 
the largest segment of the company s recurring noninterest income is the wide variety of fees earned from general banking services  which reached million in  up from the prior year 
this segment contributed of noninterest income  excluding net securities gains and loss from debt extinguishment 
a large portion of the income growth was attributable to the higher number of customer accounts due to the fleetboston branch acquisition  and is reflected in the significant increases in deposit service charges  electronic banking fees and commissions  which combined grew by million or 
overdraft fees  up million over s level  also benefited from the additional accounts  but were additionally enhanced by a mid year fee increase and the implementation of the company s overdraft freedomtm program in december overdraft freedomtm is a program currently offered to retail customers whereby the bank may pay overdrawn amounts for qualified customers up to a certain predetermined limit for which they are charged the standard overdraft fee 
this is a courtesy service to customers in good standing that may allow them to avoid late and non payment penalties from creditors and vendors and help them in their effort to avoid the negative consequences of returned checks 
this form of service is becoming an industry standard throughout much of the country 
mortgage banking fees of  in were down  from the prior year 
the main reason for the decline was that million of mortgages were sold on the secondary market in  versus million in the resulting lack of increase in servicing portfolio activity as well as mortgage prepayments in resulted in  of mortgage servicing right write downs in compared to  of mortgage servicing right income in accordingly  the mortgage servicing rights asset decreased from  at year end to  at the end of this year 
the reduced level of secondary market activity also had an impact on the second mortgage banking fee item  gains from the sale of mortgages  which dropped  in to  lower sales and mortgage prepayments were responsible for the loan servicing portfolio decreasing from million at the end of to million at year end consequently  the third component of mortgage banking income  loan servicing fees  dropped  from s level to  in as disclosed in table  fees from the financial services segment of noninterest income rose million or in to million 
financial service revenue now comprises of total noninterest income  excluding net gains losses on the sale of investment securities and debt extinguishment 
growth in cisi revenues was driven by an expanded number of financial consultants  penetration of new markets opened up by the three acquisitions  and strong annuity sales in the first half of another impressive year of revenue growth for ebt bpa was driven by the expanded servicing of a significant number of new plans 
client companies of ebt bpa are now located in states and the commonwealth of puerto rico 
lower revenue for personal trust and elias asset management reflected equity market price declines in that drove down the market value of their assets under management  which is the basis for a majority of their income 
lastly  commissions from insurance products increased by due to increased sales of creditor life and disability products and a higher dividend from the underwriter of cbsi s creditor life insurance products 
assets under management from the company s several financial services businesses dipped slightly to billion at the end of compared to billion in the prior year  with market driven declines in equity based assets being offset somewhat by growth of new plan assets at bpa 
overall  financial services contributed million before allocation of indirect corporate expense or of the company s pretax income this year  reflecting nearly a return on revenue 
in  financial services contribution was million or of total pretax income  with a return on revenue of almost 
the improvement in earnings and margin was the result of strong revenue growth at cisi and bpa and the reduction of expense levels at eam and personal trust 
the decline in percentage contribution was primarily due to large increases in net interest income and banking fees in and the existence of substantial banking related acquisition costs in lastly  income from periodic transactions in was composed of million in gains taken on million in investment sales  and a  prepayment penalty on the retirement of approximately million of intermediate term fhlb borrowings in the fourth quarter of these transactions compare to million of net investment gains and million of losses on debt extinguishment in the total net gain on security and debt transactions of million in compares to a  net loss incurred in the security gains and debt losses taken over the last two years are illustrative of the company s active management of its investment portfolio and capital market borrowings to achieve a desirable total return through combined net interest income and transaction gains losses across financial market cycles

the remainder of the increases in salary  benefit  and payroll tax expense reflect competitive annual merit awards for employees and higher pension expense discussed in further detail below 
total full time equivalent staff at year end was  versus  at year end qualified and non qualified pension expense of million in was up  or from s level 
this increase was primarily due to additional pension obligations for the employees added through the fleetboston branch acquisition pension plan assets were not included in the acquisition  a reduction from for pre acquisition flib portion to of the discount rate applied to future payments and higher executive pension eligible earnings 
the three assumptions that have the largest impact on the calculation of annual pension expense are the aforementioned discount rate  the rate applied to future compensation increases and the expected rate of return on plan assets for the next fiscal year 
table contains the results of a sensitivity analysis conducted to determine what the impact of a percentage point increase and decrease in these three assumptions would have on the forthcoming annual pension expense for the two plans 
table pension plan sensitivity analysis s omitted one percentage point pension expense increase decrease increase decrease discount rate rate of compensation increase expected return on plan assets nonpersonnel expense declined  or in due to significantly lower acquisition and unusual expenses in excluding acquisition related expenses  nonpersonnel expense rose million or in as displayed in table  this was largely caused by data processing  up million or  occupancy expense  up million or  and equipment expense  up million or 
the increases in net occupancy and equipment expenses in were mainly due to the full year impact of having significantly more branches  and the corresponding expenditures necessary to adequately manage the resulting higher volume of business 
data processing expense primarily relates to fiserv processing fees  data line charges  check and atm processing expenses and financial market transaction expenses incurred by the company s financial service units 
the processing expense increase was driven by the higher number of banking customer accounts and strong growth at the company s broker dealer and pension administration businesses 
these higher expense items were partially offset by a  decrease in intangible amortization expense in as a result of the adoption of sfas and sfas  accounting statements that call for the discontinuation of the amortization of certain goodwill associated with whole company and branch acquisitions  respectively 
please refer to note f on page for further information on these accounting statements 
the efficiency ratio  a performance measurement tool widely used by banks  is defined at two levels 
the nominal ratio is total overhead expense divided by operating income full tax equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income  excluding net securities and debt gains and losses 
the adjusted or recurring efficiency ratio additionally excludes unusual expenses a majority of which are acquisition related and intangible amortization a non cash expense as well as all one time noninterest income  these one time income items mostly relate the disposal of branch properties 
lower ratios correspond to higher efficiency 
in  the nominal efficiency ratio dropped by percentage points to  primarily as a result of much higher net interest income and significantly lower acquisition related expenses 
the company s nominal ratio of was in line with the peer bank ratio of for the nine months ended september the recurring efficiency ratio decreased a favorable percentage points from s level to 
these results reflect the full year impact of a combined million in annual cost savings from actions taken at first liberty in mid second quarter and the benefit of streamlining our operations functions by eliminating duplicate loan and deposit processing units in canton and olean  ny 
the recurring ratio for the second half of was  percentage points below that of the first half  demonstrating substantially improved efficiency arising from the full integration of the acquisitions and the consolidated operations units 
due to the nature of the company s financial services businesses  the efficiency ratio of those activities is much higher than that generated by banking operations in most part due to the largest banking expense  interest  being netted against gross interest income 
the recurring efficiency ratio for financial services was for  up from in  primarily as a result of the adverse impact of unfavorable equity market conditions on elias asset management 
the recurring efficiency ratio of the company s banking activities was this year compared to in the efficiency improvements mentioned above had a proportionally greater benefit on the banking portion of the business in acquisition and unusual expenses  which are excluded from recurring efficiency ratio calculations  totaled  in these expenditures were primarily comprised of legal and consulting fees of   of severance expense and general administrative expenses totaling  a vast majority of these expenses was incurred in conjunction with the fleetboston branch acquisition  with the balance pertaining to the first liberty acquisition primarily severance 
as displayed above in table  recurring noninterest expenses for the fourth quarter of were million or above the equivalent prior year period 
this change was primarily due to incurring a full quarter of expenses associated with the branches acquired from fleetboston versus approximately a month and a half in adoption of sfas and sfas in resulted in significantly lower intangible amortization prior year not restated as prescribed by the accounting statements  offsetting a portion of the increases in most of the other expense categories 
income and income taxes income before taxes of million was up million or from the prior year s amount 
pre tax income  adjusted to gross up all tax exempt interest income to a full tax equivalent basis  was million  million or above s level 
the company estimates its tax expense based on the amount it expects to owe the respective tax authorities 
taxes are discussed in more detail in note i of the consolidated financial statements on page accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities 
in estimating accrued taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the company s tax position 
if the final resolution of taxes payable differs from our estimates due to regulatory determination or legislative or judicial actions  adjustments to tax expense may be required 
the effective tax rate for declined by percentage points to 
the lower rate resulted in higher earnings per share in this decline was primarily due to the benefits realized on a larger proportion of income from tax exempt investment securities  which mitigated the effect of the near doubling of income before tax 
in addition  the adoption of sfas and  the lack of nondeductible merger expenses in compared with  and a federal low income housing tax credit claimed in  all contributed to the decline in the effective tax rate 
capital shareholders equity ended at million  up million or from one year earlier

the tangible equity tangible assets ratio ended the year at versus at december   approximately basis points of this improvement reflect the increase in the mva 
the company s improved capital position strengthens its risk profile and better enables it to take advantage of potential future strategic growth opportunities 
cash dividends declared on common stock in of million represented an increase of over the prior year 
this growth is partially a result of a higher number of shares outstanding in the first three quarters of due to the million shares issued in the fourth quarter of the increase also reflects the quarterly dividend per share being raised from to in the third quarter of cbsi s dividend payout ratio for the year was compared to in as a percent of net income operating  within the company s targeted payout range for dividends on common stock of 
its payout ratio has historically been high relative to peers  and for  the ratio was in the st peer percentile 
the large decrease in the payout ratio despite the higher dividend reflects the increase in net income from the prior year  which was largely due to higher interest earning assets  an improved net interest margin in  and considerably more acquisition related expenses in during the first quarter of  the company made a contribution of million to its defined benefit pension plan 
at march   an updated actuarial valuation was performed which showed that plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation qualified pension obligations based on current compensation levels 
as a result  the additional minimum pension liability of million  which was recorded at december  as a charge to shareholders equity  net of tax  was reversed 
during the last three quarters of the company contributed an additional million to the plan to cover the decline in plan assets partially caused by soft equity markets 
at year end  an actuarial valuation was conducted 
it was determined that plan assets were greater than the accumulated benefit obligation  and therefore no minimum pension liability adjustment was necessary

intangible assets intangible assets consist of core deposit intangibles and goodwill arising from acquisitions 
core deposit intangibles represent the premium the company has paid for deposits acquired in excess of the cost incurred had the funds been purchased in the capital markets 
core deposit intangibles are amortized on either an accelerated or straight line basis over periods ranging from seven to fifteen years 
goodwill represents the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill is subjected to an annual impairment analysis to determine whether the carrying value of the acquired net assets exceeds their fair value  which would necessitate a write down of the goodwill 
the company completed its goodwill impairment analysis during and no adjustment was necessary 
the impairment analysis was based upon discounted cash flow modeling techniques that require management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
it also requires them to select a discount rate that reflects the current return requirements of the market in relation to present risk free interest rates  required equity market premiums and company specific risk indicators 
loans the company s loans outstanding  by type  as of december are as follows table loans outstanding as of december  s omitted real estate mortgages residential      commercial loans secured by real estate      farm      total      commercial  financial  and agricultural commercial and financial      agricultural      total      installment loans to individuals      other loans      gross loans      less unearned discount    net loans      allowance for loan losses      loans  net of allowance for loan losses      as disclosed in table above  loans outstanding  net of unearned discount  reached a record billion as of year end  up million or compared to twelve months earlier 
cbna s new york franchise grew million or during the year to billion 
in contrast  the pennsylvania franchise decreased by million or to million at year end a highly competitive marketplace along with soft economic conditions contributed to the decline at first liberty 
management is focused on enhancing lending efforts in the pennsylvania market and is committed to achieving solid loan growth in that region 
based on overall asset liability analysis  the decision was made not to sell secondary market eligible mortgages for the first three quarters of consequently  only million of the mortgages originated within our local markets were sold in the secondary market in versus million in had these loans not been sold in  loan growth would have been million or 
the company s predominant focus on the retail borrower enables its loan portfolio to be highly diversified 
as demonstrated in table below  approximately of loans outstanding are oriented to consumers borrowing on an installment and residential mortgage loan basis 
this proportion increased from at year end due to the decline in the business lending portfolio and the strong growth of residential mortgages in there is a high degree of diversification within the business lending sector 
the bank s business loans are typically for amounts under  accounting for about of the number of business loans and approximately of business loan balances as of december  about of the business portfolio is comprised of loans between  and million about of the number of loans  while loans over million comprise another of the portfolio of the number of loans 
the portfolio contains no credit card receivables 
table below recasts the company s loan portfolio into four major lines of business 
the increase in consumer mortgages contributed million of the million in total loan growth in  and consumer indirect loans accounted for million 
conversely  consumer direct and business lending portfolios were down million and million from year end levels  respectively 
the following section discusses the underlying reasons for changes in each of the company s four major lending activities or lines of business 
table nature of lending million and mix mix mix consumer mortgage business lending consumer indirect consumer direct total loans    the combined total of general purpose business lending  dealer floor plans  mortgages on commercial property  and farm loans is characterized as the company s business lending activity 
the portfolio decreased by million or in and reflects declines of million in new york and million in pennsylvania as lending efforts were impeded by soft economic conditions and diminished capital spending levels in the commercial sector 
management is committed to growing the business lending portfolio through a strategy predicated upon hiring talented professionals  intensifying calling efforts  and expanding business relationships in order to be positioned to fully take advantage of growth opportunities once economic conditions improve 
the bank s total commercial portfolio is broadly diversified by industry type with the largest shares being in commercial real estate  services  and health care  followed by auto dealers  agriculture  hotel eating drinking  and manufacturing  construction  retail trade and transportation each as of year end miscellaneous industries make up the balance at 
demand for installment debt indirectly originated through automobile  marine  and mobile home dealers increased substantially in indirect loans ended the year or million higher  primarily reflecting successful business development efforts that increased the number of dealer relationships and the bank s ability to deliver attractive financing rates 
ninety one percent of this portfolio segment relates to automobile lending of the vehicles are used versus new 
indirect loans increased million in the company s first liberty franchise and were up million in the new york markets 
the segment of the company s loan portfolio consisting of consumer mortgages is predominantly fixed versus adjustable rate residential lending 
record volumes in this year s historically low interest rate environment drove strong growth of million or in nearly million of the growth was generated in the new york franchise  offset by million of run off in pennsylvania 
twenty eight percent million of the increase in the new york market portfolio was contributed by new business generated out of the branches acquired from fleetboston financial in growth in the core mortgage portfolio is lower than it could have been had it not been for the sale of selected fixed rate originations in the secondary market 
this program gives the bank the capability to offer competitive mortgage pricing and provides an additional tool to manage interest rate risk 
direct consumer loans decreased or million in to million 
loan balances fell approximately million in the new york markets and million at first liberty mostly due to the weak economy adversely affecting demand for these type of loans and a certain amount of installment loans being paid off through mortgage refinancing 
extremely competitive conditions in this lending segment within the company s pennsylvania market has led to some loan run off  and management is focused on bolstering lending business development efforts at the first liberty branches to reverse this trend 
this line of business is comprised of conventional installment loans including some isolated installment lending to small businesses  personal loans  student loans which are sold once principal repayment begins  and borrowing under variable and fixed rate home equity lines of credit 
the following table reconciles the differences between the line of business loan breakdown reflected above as compared to regulatory reporting definitions reflected on the call report  table  and note d pages of the financial statements 
table loans line of business as of december  consumer consumer consumer business total s omitted direct indirect mortgages lending loans regulatory reporting categories loans secured by real estate residential     commercial    farm   agricultural loans   commercial loans    installment loans to individuals

this compares to  and for the equivalent maturity categories at year end  respectively 
the proportional increase in loans maturing in one to five years reflects the growth of the indirect loan portfolio  a majority of which relates to auto financing that predominately have terms that fall within this range 
the reduction of the percentage of loans that mature after five years was due to a drop in time loan balances in the commercial portfolio that resulted in a loan mix weighted more towards shorter maturity loans 
the following table sets forth the profile of the loan portfolio with regard to maturity and the type of interest rate 
table loan sensitivity at december  s omitted fixed rate variable rate total due in one year or less    due after one year but within five years    due after five years    total    table above reflects the nature of the company s loan portfolio in relation to the mix of maturities and interest rate characteristics 
at year end  of loans have fixed interest rates  and the that have variable rates consist primarily of home equity and commercial loans 
there is relatively even distribution of the portfolio between loans with maturities below and above years at and at december   respectively 
refer to the market risk interest rate risk section of the md a on pages for specific information regarding the interest rate sensitivity of the company s asset and liability position at year end asset quality the following table presents information concerning nonperforming assets table nonperforming assets as of december  s omitted loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis      accruing loans which are contractually past due days or more as to principal or interest payments      total nonperforming loans      restructured loans other real estate     total nonperforming assets      ratio of allowance for loan losses to period end loans ratio of allowance for loan losses to period end nonperforming loans ratio of allowance for loan losses to period end nonperforming assets ratio of nonperforming loans to period end loans ratio of nonperforming assets to period end total loans and other real estate as shown in table above  nonperforming loans  defined as nonaccruing loans plus accruing loans days or more past due  ended at million  up approximately million or from one year earlier 
this was primarily due to increases in commercial loan nonaccruals 
the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans rose basis points from twelve months earlier to 
as of september   when the nonperforming loan ratio stood at  the company s asset quality was favorable to the peer level of 
the ratio of nonperforming assets which includes troubled debt restructuring and other real estate  or oreo  in addition to nonperforming loans to total loans plus oreo increased to at year end  up basis points from one year earlier

these measures were  and as of september  compared to peer levels of   and  respectively 
as of september   the total delinquency ratio of was lower than the peer ratio of 
a portion of the increase in net charge offs was due to the significantly higher average loan portfolio in as a result of the million of loans added as part of the fleetboston branch acquisition in mid november consequently  net charge offs as a percent of average loans offers a clearer representation of asset quality trends 
total net charge offs for were higher by million or  finishing the year at million versus million in as a percentage of average loans  net charge offs were up basis points from last year to 
gross charge offs rose to million  or of average loans outstanding versus in this year s recoveries increased  to million  representing of prior year gross charge offs compared to in for the nine months ended september   the bank s total net charge off ratio of was in the th peer percentile based on the peer norm of 
commercial loan net charge offs increased in  totaling million or of average commercial outstandings versus million and in the primary reason for the increased commercial net charge off ratio was weakened economic conditions in the markets served by the bank and charge offs on two particular commercial credits 
consumer installment net charge offs rose to million from million in  but the net charge off ratio was virtually flat at a basis point level 
the net charge off dollar amount and ratio were lower for the indirect installment portfolio loans originated largely through automobile dealerships in  while both these items increased on the direct installment portfolio 
a portion of this increase reflects certain differences in underwriting criteria for acquired loans than that practiced by the bank 
mortgage net charge offs were de minimus in both years 
the risk profile of new installment loans booked in improved versus in relation to the credit quality of the borrowers 
seventy five percent of new installment lending volume in was rated as a and b paper  the two highest rankings in the standard a d credit categories  compared to in management continually evaluates the credit quality of the company s loan portfolio and conducts a formal review of the allowance for loan loss adequacy on a quarterly basis 
the two primary components of the loan review process that are used to determine proper allowance levels are specific and general loan loss allocations 
specific loan loss allocations are established for loans within the commercial loan portfolio that are determined to be temporarily impaired 
the bank s commercial lenders identify such loans through regular credit analysis of their customers financial health and the collateral supporting their loans 
if it is determined that cash flow generating ability of the commercial customer may not be adequate to enable to them to make full payment of principal and interest as scheduled  and the fair market value of the assets collateralizing the loans is not sufficient to cover potential losses  the loans are categorized as temporarily impaired 
the impairment is deemed temporary if there is expectation that the financial performance of the customer will improve or that the value of the collateral will appreciate 
if this is not the case  the impairment is considered permanent  and the loan will be charged off 
specific loan loss allocations are established for all large temporarily impaired commercial loans based on their collateral shortfall 
the second component of the allowance establishment process  general loan loss allocations  is composed of two calculations that are computed on the four main loan segments commercial  consumer direct  consumer indirect and residential real estate 
the first calculation determines an allowance level based on the latest three years of historical net charge off data for each loan category 
the second calculation is qualitative and takes into consideration five major factors affecting the level of loan loss risk portfolio risk migration patterns internal credit quality trends  the growth of the segments of the loan portfolio  economic and business environment trends in the bank s markets includes review of bankruptcy  unemployment  population  consumer spending and regulatory trends  industry  geographical and product concentrations in the portfolio  and the perceived effectiveness of managerial resources and lending practices and policies 
these two allowance calculations are added together to determine the general allocation ratio  which is applied to the four homogenous loan pools excluding commercial loan balances with specific loan loss allocations 
the allowance levels computed from the specific and general loan loss allocation methods are combined to derive the necessary allowance for loan loss to be reflected on the consolidated statement of condition 
the loan loss provision is calculated by subtracting the previous period allowance for loan loss  net of the interim period net charge offs  from the current required allowance level 
this provision is then booked as an expense in the income statement for that period 
the loan review department  senior credit officers  executive management and the loan committee of the board of directors all examine the results of the allowance for loan loss process in detail and determine if it is adequate each quarter 
management is committed to continually improving the credit assessment and risk management capabilities of the bank and will dedicate the resources necessary to ensure advancement in this critical area of operations 
the allowance for loan loss was increased to million at year end versus million at the end of the million increase was due to million more loans outstanding  a year end update of the historical component of the general allocation calculation s high commercial charge off ratio replaced s comparatively low ratio  and higher commercial loan specific allocations or of the commercial portfolio at december  versus million or at year end 
as a percent of total loans  the allowance for loan loss ratio increased to for year end versus last year 
as of september   the company s reserve ratio of was basis points below the peer median  while the coverage of nonperforming loans at was above the norm of st percentile 
management believes year end coverage at to be adequate in light of the probable losses in the company s loan portfolio 
the loan loss provision as percentage of average loans increased from in to for all of this year 
the annualized provision ratio for the nine months ended september  of was slightly above the peer norm of 
due to higher net charge offs in and management s assessment of the probable losses in the loan portfolio as discussed above  loan loss provision increased by million or in loan loss provision covered net charge offs by this year versus in changes in the allowance for loan losses for the last five years is as follows table allowance for loan loss activity as of december  s omitted amount of loans outstanding at end of period      daily average amount of loans net of unearned discount      balance of allowance for loan losses at beginning of period

there are three primary sources of funding that comprise cbsi s overall funding matrix  which considers maturity  stability  and price deposits of individuals  partnerships and corporations ipc deposits  collateralized municipal deposits public funds  and capital market borrowings 
table source of funds average th quarter balances million and mix mix mix ipc deposits    public funds capital borrowings total fund sources    the company s funding matrix continues to benefit from a high level of ipc deposits  which reached an all time record with a fourth quarter average of billion  an increase of million or over the comparable period 
this is largely due to the million in deposits acquired from the former fleetboston branches in november from the acquisition date through year end  ipc deposits in the acquired branches have increased 
ipc deposits are frequently considered to be a bank s most attractive source of funding because they are generally stable  do not need to be collateralized  have a relatively low cost  and represent a strong customer base for which a variety of loan  deposit and other financial service related products can be cross sold 
the mix of cbsi s deposits changed only modestly  with the average fourth quarter time deposit mix dropping from of ipc deposits in to in this decrease largely reflects certain customer preferences not to renew at current rates  often placing the funds in non cd accounts at the bank for the time being 
a higher mix of money market and checking deposits in the fourth quarter of versus the year earlier period was not unexpected given the interest rate environment 
historically low market rates resulted in reduced spreads between cds and other interest bearing deposits and lessened the opportunity costs associated with holding demand deposits 
deposits of local municipalities decreased million or during the past year  with balances for fourth quarter averaging million versus million for the same quarter 
under new york state municipal law  the company is required to collateralize all local government deposits with marketable securities from its investment portfolio 
because of this stipulation  management considers this source of funding to be equivalent to capital market borrowings 
as such  cbsi endeavors to price these deposits at or below alternative capital market borrowing rates 
municipal deposits decreased due to the favorability of the aforementioned borrowing rates in comparison to competitive pricing of the public fund deposits 
it should be noted that utilization of municipal deposits has generally been flat to down over the last few years as a percent of total funding sources 
capital market borrowings are defined as funding sources available on a national market basis  generally requiring some form of collateralization 
borrowing sources for the company include the federal home loan bank of new york  federal reserve bank of new york  as well as access to the national repurchase agreement market through established relationships with primary market security dealers 
also considered as borrowings are the million in fixed rate company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities trust preferred issued to support s acquisitions and approximately million in floating rate trust preferred raised to support the fleetboston branch acquisition 
capital market borrowings averaged million or of total funding sources for fourth quarter  an increase from the fourth quarter level of million or of total funding 
these additional borrowings were used to fund investment purchases made during the first half of as of december   or million of capital market borrowings excluding the aforementioned line of credit and trust preferred securities had remaining terms of one year or less 
during fourth quarter  approximately million in term advances from the federal home loan bank were prepaid  resulting in a prepayment penalty of  this strategy was implemented because the cost of replacement debt  including prepayment penalty  was economically justified versus continuing to hold the existing instruments 
a similar strategy was executed in third quarter when million of debt was prepaid  resulting in a penalty of million

this must be accomplished within the following constraints a implementing certain interest rate risk management strategies which achieve a relatively stable level of net interest income  b providing both the regulatory and operational liquidity necessary to conduct day to day business activities  c considering investment risk weights as determined by the regulatory risk based capital guidelines  and d generating a favorable return without undue compromise of the other requirements 
from december  to december   the book value of cbsi s investment portfolio increased million or to billion  reflective of purchase strategies largely in the first half of  offset by planned investment runoff and strategic investment sales 
investment interest income in was million or higher than the prior year as a result of million or higher average outstandings  partially offset by a decrease in the average investment yield from to 
this drop occurred because the decrease in taxable yields caused by the overall decrease in market rates more than offset the increased yield and greater mix of tax exempt holdings  whose maturities were lengthened 
through september   the tax equivalent investment yield was in the exceptional th percentile compared to national peer banks in the to billion asset range 
to protect the bank against exposure to falling interest rates  the bulk of the bank s purchases were in intermediate term municipal bonds and agency securities with a minimum of five years of call protection 
despite a continued falling rate environment  the steepness of the yield curve in combined with the call protected yields on this year s investment purchases  allowed for widening spreads over cost of funds on investment transactions 
during  approximately million of investments were sold  resulting in net investment gains of approximately million 
the sales were based on the company s total return strategy see below or to maintain holdings within investment policy guidelines 
those proceeds that were reinvested resulted in an improved interest rate risk position 
the investment portfolio has essentially no credit risk due to the composition continuing to heavily favor us agency debentures  us agency mortgage backed pass throughs  us agency cmos and municipal bonds insured by third parties 
as of year end  these four aaa rated highest possible rating security types accounted for of the total portfolio excluding federal home loan bank stock and federal reserve bank stock  or   and respectively 
these four security types comprised of total investments as of december  at   and  respectively 
while a little more than a third of the investment portfolio at year end is in municipal bonds  management believes that the tax risk in the company s municipal investments arising from potential future changes in statutory  judicial and regulatory actions is minimal 
the investment portfolio s december  effective duration  which measures price sensitivity  was years 
since  the company has utilized total return as its primary methodology for managing investment portfolio assets 
under this analytical method  shareholder value is maximized through both interest income and market value appreciation 
for the third quarter of  the company s five year total return at was in the extremely favorable th peer percentile per the investment performance digest 
because nearly all of the company s investments are classified as available for sale  any broad change in market value has a significant impact on book equity

market risk interest rate risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates or prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is to interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk  over both a short term tactical and longer term strategic time horizon  is an important component of the company s asset liability management process  which is governed by policies established by its board of directors and reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to the asset liability management committee alco 
in this capacity  alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability management activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits  and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
as the company does not believe it is possible to reliably predict future interest rate movements  it has maintained an appropriate process and set of measurement tools which enable it to identify and quantify sources of interest rate risk in varying rate environments 
the primary tool used by the company in managing interest rate risk is income simulation 
the analysis begins by measuring the impact of differences in maturity and repricing of all balance sheet positions 
such work is further augmented by adjusting for prepayment and embedded option risk found naturally in certain asset and liability classes 
finally  balance sheet growth and funding expectations are added to the analysis in order to reflect the strategic initiatives set forth by the company 
changes in net interest income are reviewed after subjecting the balance sheet to an array of treasury yield curve possibilities 
the following reflects the company s one year net interest income sensitivity based on asset and liability levels on december   assuming no growth in the balance sheet  and assuming an instantaneous basis point increase and basis point decrease in the prime rate  federal funds rate and the entire treasury yield curve 
this test is one that is suggested by the company s regulators the office of the comptroller of the currency  and represents conditions that are largely theoretical as compared to the management model discussed below 
table regulatory model net interest income rate change dollar change during first months in basis points versus no change in rates percent change bp million bp million when compared to no change in interest rates during the first months  net interest income performs better in the rising rate environment than in the falling rate environment due in large part to significant levels of core deposits  which are not as volatile in terms of rate movement as are other funding sources 
additionally  to consider balance sheet growth and the steepness in slope of the treasury yield curve as of year end  a second group of simulations was performed based on what the company believes to be conservative levels of balance sheet growth low single digit growth in loans and deposits along with natural run off of investments  augmented by any necessary changes in borrowings  with no growth in other major portions of the balance sheet 
on that basis  a variety of scenarios was tested  including moving prime and fed funds up basis points and down basis points over a month period while flattening the long end of the treasury curve to spreads over fed funds that are more consistent with historical norms 
table management model net interest income rate change dollar change during first months in basis points versus no change in rates percent change bp million bp million this test is considered by company management to be a more realistic measure of interest rate risk when compared to no change in rates over the first months 
nonetheless  the analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and other factors 
while the assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
liquidity due to the potential for unexpected fluctuations in deposits and loans  active management of the company s liquidity is critical 
in order to respond to these circumstances  adequate sources of both on and off balance sheet funding are in place 
cbsi s primary approach to measuring liquidity is known as the basic surplus deficit model 
it is used to calculate liquidity over two time periods first  the amount of cash that could be made available within days calculated as liquid assets less short term liabilities  and second  a projection of subsequent cash availability over an additional days 
the minimum policy level of liquidity under the basic surplus deficit approach is of total assets for both the and day time horizons 
as of year end  this ratio was and  respectively  excluding the company s capacity to borrow additional funds from the federal home loan bank 
to measure longer term liquidity  a baseline projection of loan and deposit growth for five years is made to reflect how current liquidity levels could change over time 
this five year measure reflects ample liquidity for loan growth over the next five years
