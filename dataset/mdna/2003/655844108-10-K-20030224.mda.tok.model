item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
norfolk southern corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes and the five year financial review 
summarized results of operations compared with net income was million in  up million  or 
results in included a million gain from discontinued operations related to the sale of ns former motor carrier subsidiary see note 
excluding that gain from s results  net income was up million  or  in the improvement was primarily the result of a million  or  increase in income from railway operations 
diluted earnings per share were  up 
excluding the discontinued operations gain  diluted earnings per share increased 
compared with net income in was million  up 
income from continuing operations  which excludes the million discontinued operations gain  was million  up 
results in included million of costs related to actions taken to reduce the size of the work force  which reduced income from continuing operations by million  or cents per diluted share 
excluding these costs  income from continuing operations increased million  or  in the improvement resulted from higher income from railway operations  which was up million  or  that more than offset lower nonoperating income  which was down million see note 
diluted earnings per share were cents  up 
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were cents  up 
excluding the work force reduction costs in  diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up 
detailed results of operations railway operating revenues railway operating revenues were billion in  and billion in both and the following table presents a three year comparison of revenues by market group 
k revenues by market group in millions coal general merchandise automotive chemicals metals construction agriculture consumer products government paper clay forest general merchandise intermodal total in  revenues increased  as a rise in general merchandise revenues coupled with a improvement in intermodal revenues offset a decline in coal revenues 
all but one of the general merchandise market groups paper  clay and forest products posted increases over as shown in the following table  most of the revenue improvement was the result of higher traffic volumes 
the favorable revenue per unit mix variance was driven by higher average revenue per unit  offset in part by the effects of unfavorable changes in the mix of traffic 
revenue variance analysis increases decreases vs 
vs 
in millions volume revenue per unit mix total in  revenues fell for all the general merchandise market groups 
however  a increase in coal revenues offset the effects of the lower general merchandise revenues 
revenue per unit increased in all market groups  principally due to rate increases  use of higher capacity equipment and favorable changes in the mix of traffic 
coal tonnage decreased in and revenues declined 
revenue per unit declined slightly  reflecting unfavorable changes in the mix of traffic more shorter haul business that offset the effects of rate increases and gains in tonnage per car 
coal  coke and iron ore represented of total railway operating revenues in  and of ns coal shipments originated on lines it operates 
in  coal tonnage increased  and revenues improved 
revenue per unit increased  a result of rate increases  including lower volume related refunds on export coal shipments  gains in tonnage per car and favorable changes in the mix of traffic less shorter haul business 
k total coal  coke and iron ore tonnage in millions of tons utility export domestic metallurgical other total utility coal tonnage decreased in  a result of lower demand that reflected the weak economy  high coal stockpile levels entering the year  mild temperatures in the first quarter  reduced stockpile targets set by utility companies and increased generation from new natural gas fired plants 
licensing requirements for these new plants resulted in additional generation that temporarily displaced coal fired generation 
in  utility coal traffic increased  reflecting higher demand for coal fired electricity and the effects of very high natural gas prices early in the year 
high demand for coal  a volatile market for natural gas and production problems at a number of large mines in the east late in combined to increase demand somewhat early in with a resulting increase in coal prices 
utility coal traffic volume also benefited somewhat from the shifting of coal that traditionally would have been bound for export to the domestic market 
two of ns utility customers  duke energy duke and carolina power and light cp l  have filed rate reasonableness complaints at the surface transportation board stb alleging that the ns tariff rates for the transportation of coal to their solely served power plants are unreasonable 
ns is disputing these allegations 
since january   in the case of duke and since april   in the case of cp l  ns has been billing and collecting amounts from the customers based on the challenged tariff rates 
management expects that the resolution of these cases  which is anticipated to occur in  will not have a material effect on ns financial statements 
the near term outlook for utility coal remains positive 
coal fired generation remains the lowest cost marginal source of electricity 
coal plant generation should continue to track the us economy  and management expects that utilities will use coal fired plants to meet increased demand because of coal s low cost 
as always  demand will be influenced by the weather 
in addition  while the price of natural gas can affect demand for utility coal  its higher price and volatility may improve the long term competitive position of coal fired generation 
phase ii of title iv of the clean air act amendments of  which imposed more stringent limits on sulfur dioxide emissions  took effect on jan 
 many of the mines served by ns produce coals that satisfy phase ii requirements 
in addition  substantial banks of sulfur dioxide allowances held by many ns served utilities  as well as implementation of sulfur dioxide emission control systems at many ns served plants  should continue to provide a market for other ns served mines 
while the phase ii impact on ns utility coal has been minimal  there are a number of other evolving environmental issues that have the potential to increase or ease cost pressures on the utility coal market  depending upon their outcome 
these include a potential new national energy policy  proposed multi pollutant legislation  a proposed new rule concerning new source review  the impending mercury emissions standard and the fate of us participation in the kyoto protocol 
k although impending developments with these environmental issues could potentially increase cost pressures on coal fired generation  the outlook remains positive for maintaining coal s position in the power generation mix for regions served by ns 
however  different developments with these issues could actually ease cost pressures on coal fired generation  further strengthening coal s position 
the decision by a federal district court judge in west virginia holding that some common mountaintop mining practices in the coal industry are illegal was overturned in april by the us fourth circuit court of appeals 
in january  the us supreme court refused to hear an appeal of the case 
in may  the same district court judge made a similar ruling in a different case in which ns had again intervened 
in january  this ruling also was overturned by the fourth circuit court of appeals 
export coal tonnage declined in steam coal exports through baltimore declined  and export metallurgical coals through norfolk declined 
during the first half of  demand for us coal was soft as international buyers focused their purchases toward other  lower priced sources 
market uncertainty resulted in late contract settlements and delayed shipments 
late in  demand for us coking coals increased  reflecting a shift in the market as exports from china  australia and poland declined 
as a result  shipments through norfolk increased in the fourth quarter 
in  export coal tonnage decreased 
the rapid rise of domestic utility coal prices early in the year enticed many foreign market suppliers to place much of their production in the domestic utility markets 
in addition  production difficulties at several large ns served mines and flooding in west virginia in july significantly reduced the supply of low volatility coal 
the combination of these factors resulted in most of the decline in shipments of export coal 
steam coal exports through baltimore declined  and export metallurgical coals through norfolk declined by 
demand for steam coal to export strengthened in the last half of  however  strong us demand limited ns participation in this market 
demand for coking coal to export continued to soften  as steel production moved from traditional ns markets in europe to asia  which in recent years has been supplied by australian or canadian coals 
it is expected that export coal tonnage will continue to be limited by supply and subject to the fluctuations of the world market 
the increase in demand for us coals seen in the fourth quarter of has continued into the first quarter of  and early indications are that these market forces should remain in place as contracts are settled in the spring for the coming year 
should these market forces continue  us coal export volumes could recover somewhat 
however  the inherent volatility and uncertainties in this market make predictions especially vulnerable 
domestic metallurgical coal  coke and iron ore tonnage increased in  reflecting higher us steel production that was aided by the imported steel tariff program implemented in in addition  continued strong vehicle production resulted in demand for steel 
in  domestic metallurgical coal  coke and iron ore tonnage decreased due to a decline in the market for domestic steel 
the softening economy and an increase in steel imports drastically cut blast furnace production  sharply reducing the demand for coking coal  iron ore and coke 
the increase in imported steel also resulted in lower prices that put pressure on the us steel industry and led to plant closures and bankruptcies that included some ns customers 
domestic metallurgical coal  coke and iron ore traffic is expected to continue to experience modest gains during the two year life of the import tariffs 
however  long term demand is expected to decline  reflecting advanced technologies that allow production of steel using less coke 
k other coal tonnage  principally steam coal shipped to manufacturing plants  decreased in  but increased in the decline in was primarily the result of the weak economy 
the gain in resulted from new and increased business from industrial customers 
general merchandise traffic volume carloads increased in  and revenues increased  principally due to a improvement in automotive revenues 
in  traffic volume decreased  and revenues decreased  reflecting the effects of a weak economy 
automotive traffic volume increased  and revenues increased in  principally due to a rise in vehicle production and new business 
revenue per unit increased  reflecting some pricing improvements  extended length of haul  special ancillary services and the settlement of a disputed charge 
in  automotive traffic volume decreased  and revenues declined  principally due to a drop in vehicle production 
revenue per unit increased  principally due to rate increases  efficiencies gained from the redesign of the mixing center network and use of higher capacity equipment 
automotive revenues in are expected to be lower than those of light vehicle production is predicted to be down slightly  and ns largest automotive customer has announced a decrease in first quarter production 
chemicals traffic volume increased slightly  and revenues increased in higher traffic volume for plastics and a small increase for miscellaneous chemicals offset a decline for petroleum products 
demand for plastics was supported by increases in light vehicle production and housing starts 
traffic volume also benefited from increased shipments through ns thoroughbred bulk transfer tbt facilities that handle chemicals and bulk commodities for customers not located on ns served lines 
revenue per unit increased as a result of a favorable change in the mix of traffic more higher rated business and market driven rate increases 
in  chemicals traffic volume decreased  and revenues decreased 
the weak economy depressed shipments of petroleum  plastics  industrial and miscellaneous chemicals 
these declines were partially offset by new business through ns tbt facilities 
revenue per unit increased due to higher rates and a favorable change in the mix of traffic more longer haul moves 
chemicals revenues are expected to improve in  supported by a recovering economy  new business and improved revenue per unit 
metals and construction traffic volume increased  and revenues improved in  reflecting improvement in the steel industry  which was aided by the two year imported steel tariff program implemented in metals volume benefited from resumption of production at some mills that closed in and increased volume from new mills 
construction traffic declined  primarily as a result of reductions in highway projects due to state government budget pressures 
in  metals and construction traffic volume decreased  and revenues declined  reflecting weakness in the steel and construction industries 
the steel industry recession  which began in  resulted in excess capacity and the closing of numerous steel mills 
revenue per unit increased due to higher rates and favorable changes in the mix of traffic 
metals and construction revenues are expected to continue to benefit from added production along ns lines  although further consolidation in the steel industry is expected 
construction markets may benefit from new business from stone quarries and cement terminals in the southeast 
agriculture  consumer products and government traffic volume decreased slightly in  but revenues increased 
traffic volume increases for corn  food products and beverages largely offset declines for soybeans and feed 
corn volume benefited from increased shipments from the midwest to k drought stricken areas in the east 
the increase for food products was primarily the result of new business 
soybean and feed volumes were adversely affected by lower domestic and export demand 
revenue per unit increased because of higher rates  increased length of haul and favorable changes in the mix of traffic 
in  agriculture  consumer products and government traffic volume decreased  and revenues declined  primarily due to reduced shipments of fertilizer 
this decline was due to soft farm demand  record high natural gas prices early in the year which curtailed production of certain fertilizers and increased imports 
this was mitigated by traffic volume increases for grain  flour and canned goods 
the revenue per unit increase was primarily due to favorable changes in the mix of traffic 
agriculture  consumer products and government revenues in are expected to continue to benefit from higher corn  fertilizer and food product volume 
fertilizer volumes may be favorably affected by the reopening of a large phosphate fertilizer plant 
paper  clay and forest products traffic volume declined  and revenues decreased  in  primarily due to continued weakness in the paper market  especially in the first half of the year 
traffic volume improved later in the year as the paper market strengthened 
in addition  ns gained business from conversion of truck shipments to rail and from continued strength in housing starts 
revenue per unit benefited from rate increases and a decline in shorter haul business 
in  paper  clay and forest products traffic volume declined  and revenues decreased  primarily due to a weakened paper market 
paper shipments were adversely affected by reduced production at many ns served paper mills  a result of sluggish newspaper advertising and soft demand for paper 
lumber traffic began the year weak  improved in late summer  but softened late in the year due to short term weakness in housing starts 
revenue per unit increased principally due to higher rates 
paper  clay and forest products revenues are expected to improve slightly in as a result of a recovering economy  service improvements and new business 
intermodal traffic volume increased  and revenues increased  in volume growth was principally the result of new and improved services that resulted in new business  including the conversion of truck business to rail 
international traffic  which accounts for about half of intermodal volume  increased  supported by growth in trade activity and new business  including the conversion of over the road traffic 
domestic shipments grew  primarily because of new business gained from the conversion of truck shipments 
triple crown services company tcs volume increased 
revenue per unit declined as a result of an increase in shorter haul business and the absence of fuel surcharges that were in place in  which were partially offset by some rate increases 
in  intermodal traffic volume decreased  but revenues increased slightly 
domestic traffic volume was up in the first half of the year  but demand increasingly weakened as the year progressed  which eroded ns base of traffic 
new business supported by the opening of three new terminals and other initiatives mitigated the effects of the weakened economy 
international traffic grew slightly as us imports slowed with the economy 
tcs traffic volume increased despite economic conditions  as it continued to provide reliable  trucklike service 
intermodal revenue per unit dropped later in the year  reflecting the expiration of fuel surcharges that were implemented late in and the introduction of new shorter haul business 
in  intermodal revenues are expected to continue to benefit from new business supported by continued improvements in service and conversion of truck traffic to rail 
k railway operating expenses railway operating expenses decreased in  while carloads increased 
in  railway operating expenses declined 
however  expenses in included million of costs related to actions taken to reduce the size of the work force 
excluding these costs  railway operating expenses decreased in  while carloads dropped 
the railway operating ratio  which measures the percentage of railway operating revenues consumed by railway operating expenses  was in  compared with in and in excluding the work force reduction costs  which increased the ratio percentage points 
both declines primarily resulted from gains in efficiency  although also benefited from higher traffic volume  and benefited from increased revenue per unit 
the efficiency gains in were principally the result of the implementation of a new operating plan that emphasizes adherence to a schedule and reductions in service variability 
these improvements came despite a continuing change in the mix of traffic more resource intensive traffic  such as automotive and intermodal  coupled with the decrease in export coal traffic 
the following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications 
operating expense variances increases decreases vs 
vs 
in millions compensation and benefits materials  services and rents conrail rents and services depreciation diesel fuel casualties and other claims other total includes million of work force reduction costs in compensation and benefits represented of total railway operating expenses and increased slightly in higher wage rates  reduced pension income see note and increased health and welfare benefits costs more than offset savings from reduced employment levels and lower payroll taxes see the discussion of the railroad retirement and survivors improvement act  below 
medical costs are expected to continue to increase in  a result of higher costs for active employees and an increase in the expected inflation related to postretirement benefits 
in  compensation and benefits decreased  however  this comparison reflects the million of work force reduction costs in excluding those costs  compensation and benefits decreased  primarily a result of savings attributable to the reduced size of the work force  which were somewhat offset by higher wages and benefit costs for union employees  higher incentive compensation and reduced pension income 
the railroad retirement and survivors improvement act  which took effect on jan 
  provides for a phased reduction of the employers portions of tier ii railroad retirement payroll taxes 
the phase in calls for a reduction from in to in and in in addition  the supplemental annuity tax was eliminated 
these changes resulted in an estimated million reduction in payroll taxes in and are expected to result in savings of million in  compared with however  these k savings are expected to be offset by an increase in the railroad unemployment tax rate  higher payroll taxes on increased wages and a higher wage base 
the new law allows for investment of tier ii assets in a diversified portfolio through the newly established national railroad retirement investment trust 
the law also provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment of future tier ii payroll taxes should the trust assets fall below a four year reserve or exceed a six year reserve 
materials  services and rents includes items used for the maintenance of the railroad s lines  structures and equipment  the costs of services purchased from outside contractors  including the net costs of operating joint or leased facilities with other railroads  and the net cost of equipment rentals 
this category of expenses increased in and decreased slightly in the increase in was the result of higher volume related expenses for automotive and intermodal traffic  increased material costs for locomotives  higher expenses for roadway and bridge repairs and increased derailment costs 
these higher costs were largely offset by a significant reduction in equipment rents 
in  the effects of lower equipment rents were largely offset by higher costs for purchased services  including expenses for software  consulting and legal fees 
equipment rents  which includes the cost to ns of using equipment mostly freight cars owned by other railroads or private owners  less the rent paid to ns for the use of its equipment  decreased in and in the decline in was principally the result of continued improvement in cycle times  reflecting efficiency gains and  for intermodal equipment  service design and process changes implemented during the year 
the decrease in was primarily due to shorter car cycle times that resulted in fewer car days on line and fewer freight car and locomotive leases 
locomotive repair costs increased in and  principally due to renewed maintenance activity  which is expected to continue into freight car maintenance costs  which were relatively flat in  are also likely to increase in  as it is expected that the economy will recover and more freight cars are due for maintenance 
conrail rents and services decreased in and in this item includes amounts due to prr and crc for use of their operating properties and equipment and crc s operation of the shared assets areas 
also included is ns equity in conrail s net earnings  plus the additional amortization related to the difference between ns investment in conrail and its underlying equity see note 
both declines reflected higher conrail earnings and lower expenses in the shared assets areas see conrail s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity  below 
depreciation expense was up slightly in and increased in substantial levels of capital spending affected both years  however  depreciation expense in benefited from lower rates implemented early in the year following completion of a periodic study see note  properties  for ns depreciation policy 
diesel fuel expenses decreased in and in the decline in reflected a drop in the average price per gallon and slightly lower consumption 
expenses in included a million benefit from the hedging program initiated in the second quarter of see market risks and hedging activities  below and note 
the decrease in was the result of an drop in consumption and a decline in the average price per gallon 
expenses in included million of cost related to the hedging program 
ns expects diesel fuel prices to be higher in casualties and other claims expenses including the estimates of costs related to personal injury  property damage and environmental matters increased in  but only slightly in the increase in reflected adverse personal injury claims development as indicated by an actuarial study and higher expenses for loss and damage to lading  as well as higher insurance and environmental remediation costs 
k the largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs 
in  cases involving occupational injuries comprised about of the total employee injury cases settled and of the total settlement payments made 
injuries of this type are not generally caused by a specific accident or event  but  rather  result from a claimed exposure over time 
many such claims are being asserted by former or retired employees  some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades 
ns continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs 
the rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving job related accidental injury and occupational claims because of the federal employers liability act fela  which is applicable only to railroads 
this law  which covers employee claims for job related injuries  produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no fault workers compensation system 
ns  like many other businesses in the us  has experienced difficulty obtaining property and casualty insurance at reasonable terms since the september terrorist attacks 
thus far  ns has been successful in maintaining a substantial amount of commercial insurance for third party personal injury  property damage and fela claims that exceed the self insured retention 
however  both the cost of this commercial insurance and the amount of risk that ns retains through self insurance has more than doubled since the attacks 
other expenses decreased in and in the decline in reflected lower expenses for property and sales and use taxes 
the decrease in was principally the result of lower bad debt costs  reduced franchise and property taxes  and lower travel and employee relocation expenses 
other income net other income net was million in  million in and million in see note 
the decline in was primarily the result of higher interest accruals on federal income tax liabilities  lower gains from the sale of properties and investments  and the absence of a million gain from a nonrecurring settlement that benefited these reductions were partially offset by reduced discount from the sales of receivables due to a lower amount of receivables sold and a lower interest rate environment  which favorably affects the amount of discount 
the reduction in resulted from the absence of million of gains that occurred in related to the sale of timber rights and gas and oil royalty and working interests 
this was somewhat offset by lower interest accruals on federal income tax liabilities and the million nonrecurring settlement gain 
results in also included an million gain from a large property sale that closed in december 
income taxes income tax expense in was million for an effective rate of  compared with effective rates of in and in excluding the equity in conrail s after tax earnings  the effective rates were in and and in the effective rates in and were higher than that of  primarily due to dispositions of tax benefits related to coal seam gas properties 
the effective rates in all three years benefited from favorable adjustments upon filing the prior year tax returns and favorable adjustments to state tax liabilities 
in addition  benefited from investments in coal seam gas properties 
the effective rate may benefit from the resolution of various tax audits 
in march  the job creation and worker assistance act of was signed into law and began providing immediate tax incentives for business 
a additional first year depreciation allowance was a primary element of this legislation 
this depreciation incentive continues for three years  and during these years the resulting acceleration of tax depreciation deductions will improve cash flow by reducing current tax expense and increasing deferred tax expense by significant amounts 
k discontinued operations income from discontinued operations in consisted of a million after tax gain related to the sale of ns motor carrier subsidiary see note financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities  ns principal source of liquidity  was million in  compared with million in and billion in in  the improvement was the result of higher income from railway operations and favorable changes in working capital  which were offset  in part  by fewer accounts receivable sold see note 
receivable sales declined million in and million in the significant decline in operating cash flow in reflects the commencement in of the accounts receivable sales program 
excluding the infusion of cash in from the start of this program  operating cash flow declined by million in the decrease primarily resulted from an million reduction in the amount of accounts receivable sold  higher tax payments including amounts applicable to prior years  an increase in telecommunication receivables  bonus payments in no such payments in and the timing of payrolls 
a significant portion of payments made to prr which are included in conrail rents and services and  therefore  are a use of cash in cash provided by operating activities are borrowed back from a prr subsidiary and  therefore  are a source of cash in proceeds from borrowings 
ns net cash flow from these borrowings amounted to million in and million in ns working capital deficit was million at dec 
  compared with billion at dec 
 the decline resulted principally from the change in the terms of the note under which ns borrows funds from a subsidiary of prr see note and a reduction in the amount of debt due within one year 
debt due in is expected to be paid using cash generated from operations including sales of accounts receivable and cash on hand 
ns currently has the capability to increase the amount of accounts receivable being sold under the revolving sale program to meet its more immediate working capital needs 
during  the amount of receivables ns could sell under this program ranged from million to million  and the amount of receivables ns sold ranged from million to million 
moreover  ns has the capability to issue up to billion of commercial paper see note  however  reductions in its credit ratings could limit ns ability to access the commercial paper markets see also the discussion of financing activities  below 
ns expects to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its ongoing obligations 
this expectation is based on a view that the economy will remain flat for the first half of and resume growth in the third and fourth quarters 
k contractual obligations at dec 
  related to ns long term debt including capital leases  operating leases  agreements with crc  unconditional purchase obligations and other long term obligations are as follows and total subsequent in millions long term debt and capital leases operating leases agreements with crc unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations total ns also has contractual obligations to prr as disclosed in note however  ns has the ability to borrow back funds from prr to the extent they are not needed to fund contractual obligations at conrail 
as an indirect owner of conrail  ns may need to make capital contributions  loans or advances to conrail to fund its contractual obligations 
the following table presents of conrail s contractual obligations for long term debt including capital leases and operating leases 
conrail has no unconditional purchase or other long term obligations 
and total subsequent in millions long term debt and capital leases operating leases total ns also has two transactions not included in the balance sheets or in the previous table of its contractual obligations consisting of an accounts receivable sale program see note and an operating lease covering locomotives see note 
under the accounts receivable sale program  ns sells without recourse undivided ownership interests in a pool of accounts receivable to two unrelated buyers 
ns has no ownership interest in the buyers 
the buyers issued debt to fund their initial purchase  and ns used the proceeds it received from the initial purchase primarily to pay down its outstanding debt 
ns has no obligation related to the buyers debt  and there is no existing obligation to repurchase sold receivables 
upon termination of the program  the buyers would cease purchasing new receivables and would retain collections related to the previously sold receivables see note 
the operating lease covering the locomotives is renewable annually at ns option and expires in the lessor is a special purpose entity formed to enter into this transaction  but it is not related to ns and its owner has a substantive residual equity capital investment at risk in the entity 
the lessor owns the locomotives and issued debt to finance their purchase 
ns has no obligation related to the debt 
ns has the option to purchase the locomotives  but also can return them to the lessor 
the return provisions of the lease are not so onerous as to preclude this option 
if ns does not purchase the locomotives at the end of the maximum lease term  it is liable for any shortfall in the then fair value of the locomotives and a specified residual value 
ns does not expect to be required to make any payments k under this provision see note 
as the primary beneficiary of the business of the lessor  effective jan 
  ns consolidated the assets locomotives and liabilities debt of this special purpose entity when it implemented financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
see new accounting pronouncement on page k 
cash used for investing activities increased in and in property additions  which account for most of the recurring spending in this category  were down in  following a increase in property sales were significantly lower in  which resulted in the net increase in cash used for investing activities despite the reduction in capital spending 
the following tables show capital spending including capital leases and track and equipment statistics for the past five years 
capital expenditures in millions road equipment other property total capital expenditures which in included million of capitalized leases decreased in  but increased in the decline in reflected lower spending for intermodal facilities  as ns completed in several significant projects that expanded the capacity of the intermodal network 
higher spending on track program work was offset by fewer locomotive purchases in compared with in 
outlays in included amounts for locomotive purchases no such purchases were made in as locomotives were leased that were somewhat offset by lower expenditures for freight car purchases and roadway projects 
in  and  spending for road included fiber optic infrastructure see telecommunications subsidiary  below 
track structure statistics capital and maintenance track miles of rail installed miles of track surfaced new crossties installed millions average age of owned railway equipment years freight cars locomotives retired locomotives the table above excludes equipment leased from prr see note  which comprises of the freight car fleet and of the locomotive fleet 
through its coal car rebody program  which was suspended in  ns converted about  hopper cars into high capacity steel gondolas or hoppers 
as a result  the remaining service life of the freight car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the increasing average age shown in the table above 
k for  ns has budgeted million for capital expenditures 
the anticipated spending includes million for roadway projects  of which million is for track and bridge program work 
also included are projects for communications  signal and electrical systems  as well as projects for environmental and public improvements such as grade crossing separations and signal upgrades 
other roadway projects include marketing and industrial development initiatives  including increasing track capacity and access to coal receivers and vehicle production and distribution facilities  and continuing investments in intermodal infrastructure 
equipment spending of million includes the purchase of locomotives and upgrades to existing units  improvements to multilevel automobile racks  and projects related to computers and information technology  including additional security and backup systems 
cash used for financing activities in was million 
financing activities provided cash of million in and used cash of million in the comparisons reflect a net reduction of debt in  a net increase in and a net reduction in the comparison in also reflected the effects of the reduction to the dividend in january financing activities include loan transactions with a subsidiary of prr that resulted in net borrowings of million in and million in and net repayments of million in see note 
excluding these borrowings  debt was reduced million in  million in and million in the net reduction of debt in was accomplished in part with the proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable 
ns debt to total capitalization ratio excluding notes payable to the prr subsidiary at year end was in and in ns currently has in place a billion  five year credit agreement  which provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes financial covenants see note 
ns has outstanding million of its notes due may  each holder of a note may require ns to redeem all or part of the note at face value  plus accrued and unpaid interest  on may  ns will not know the amount of notes that it may be required to redeem until april  ns expects to be able to redeem any such notes using cash generated from operations including sales of accounts receivable  cash on hand and proceeds from borrowings 
application of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain  and future events are likely to occur that may require management to change them 
accordingly  management regularly reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience  changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management discusses the development  selection and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of its board of directors 
pensions and other postretirement benefits accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires management to make several estimates and assumptions see note 
these include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans assets  projected increases in medical costs and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality 
in addition  the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value 
management makes these estimates based on the company s historical experience and other information that it deems pertinent under the circumstances for example  expectations of future stock market performance 
management engages an independent consulting actuarial firm to aid it in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing its related liabilities 
k ns net pension benefit  which is included in compensation and benefits on its consolidated income statement  was million for the year ended dec 
 in recording this amount  ns assumed a long term investment rate of return of  compared with the rate used in the previous two years 
investment experience of the pension fund over the past  and year periods has been in excess of 
a one percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a million change to the pension credit and  as a result  an equal change in compensation and benefits expense 
changes that are reasonably likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age  projected earnings and mortality would not be expected to have a material effect on ns net pension benefit or net pension asset in the future 
the net pension asset is recorded at its net present value using a discount rate that is based on the current interest rate environment  therefore  management has little discretion in this assumption 
ns net cost for other postretirement benefits  which is also included in compensation and benefits  was million for the year ended dec 
 in recording this expense and valuing the net liability for other postretirement benefits  which is included in other benefits as disclosed in note  management estimated future increases in health care costs 
these assumptions  along with the effect of a one percentage point change in them  are described in note properties and depreciation most of ns total assets are comprised of long lived railway properties see note and its investment in conrail see note 
most of conrail s assets are long lived railway properties 
as disclosed in note  ns properties are depreciated using group depreciation 
rail is depreciated primarily on the basis of use measured by gross ton miles 
other properties are depreciated generally using the straight line method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives 
ns reviews the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flows or estimated net realizable value 
assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value 
ns is amortizing the excess of the purchase price paid for its investment in conrail over its share of conrail s net equity using the principles of purchase accounting  based primarily on the estimated remaining useful lives of conrail s properties 
ns depreciation expense is based on management s assumptions concerning service lives of its properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be received upon their retirement 
these assumptions are the product of periodic depreciation studies that are performed by a firm of consulting engineers 
these studies analyze ns historical patterns of asset use and retirement and take into account any expected change in operation or maintenance practices 
ns recent experience with these studies has been that while they do result in changes in the rates used to depreciate its properties  these changes have not caused a significant effect to its annual depreciation expense 
the studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by the study 
any such deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the affected class of property 
ns depreciation expense for the year ended dec 
  amounted to million 
ns weighted average depreciation rates for are disclosed in note  a one tenth percentage point increase or decrease in these rates would result in a million increase or decrease to ns depreciation expense 
personal injury  environmental and legal liabilities ns expense for casualties and other claims amounted to million for the year ended dec 
 most of this expense was composed of ns accrual related to personal injury liabilities see discussion of fela in the discussion captioned casualties and other claims on page k 
ns engages an independent consulting actuarial firm to aid in valuing its personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during the year 
the actuarial firm studies ns historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements 
the actuary also takes into account outside influences considered pertinent 
the study uses the results of these analyses to estimate the ultimate amount of the liability  which includes amounts for incurred but unasserted claims 
ns has recorded this actuarially determined liability 
the liability is dependent upon many individual judgments made as to the specific case reserves as well as the judgments of the consulting k actuary and management in the periodic studies 
accordingly  there could be significant changes in the liability  which ns would recognize when such a change became known 
the most recent actuarial study was performed as of june   and resulted in an increase to ns personal injury liability during the third quarter 
while the liability recorded is supported by the most recent study  it is reasonably possible that the liability could be higher or lower 
ns is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations 
it is ns policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably see note 
environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates 
ns also has established an environmental policy council  composed of senior managers  to oversee and interpret its environmental policy 
operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately million in  million in  and million in  and capital expenditures totaled approximately million in each of  and capital expenditures in are expected to be comparable to those in ns balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of million at dec 
  and million at dec 
 of which million was accounted for as a current liability in each year 
at dec 
  the liability represented ns estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at identified locations 
on that date  sites accounted for million of the liability  and no individual site was considered to be material 
ns anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years  however  some costs will be paid out over a longer period 
at some of the locations  certain ns subsidiaries  usually in conjunction with a number of other parties  have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the environmental protection agency epa or similar state authorities under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  or comparable state statutes  which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs 
with respect to known environmental sites whether identified by ns or by the epa or comparable state authorities  estimates of ns ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques  the likely development of new cleanup technologies  the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participant s share of any estimated loss and that participant s ability to bear it  and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability 
ns estimates its environmental remediation liability on a site by site basis  using assumptions and judgments that management deems appropriate for each site 
as a result  it is not practical to quantitatively discuss the effects of changes in these many assumptions and judgments 
ns has consistently applied its methodology of estimating its environmental liabilities 
the risk of incurring environmental liability for acts and omissions  past  present and future is inherent in the railroad business 
some of the commodities in ns traffic mix  particularly those classified as hazardous materials  can pose special risks that ns and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize 
in addition  several ns subsidiaries own  or have owned  land used as operating property  or which is leased or may have been leased and operated by others  or held for sale 
because environmental problems may exist on these properties that are latent or undisclosed  there can be no assurance that ns will not incur environmentally related liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them  the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time 
moreover  lawsuits and claims involving these and potentially other now unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time 
the resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition  results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 
however  based on its assessment of the facts and circumstances now known  management believes that it has recorded the probable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which the corporation is aware 
further  management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters  either individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on ns financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
k norfolk southern and certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations 
when management concludes that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  it is accrued through a charge to expenses 
while the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future developments  in management s opinion the recorded liability  if any  is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims 
however  the final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty  and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter 
any adjustments to recorded liability will be reflected in expenses in the periods in which such adjustments are known 
income taxes ns net deferred tax liability totaled  million at dec 
 see note 
this liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements 
after application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income  judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in the corporate income tax returns 
for state income and other taxes  judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions 
a valuation allowance is recorded if management expects that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized 
ns has only a million valuation allowance on million of deferred tax assets as of dec 
  reflecting the expectation that most of these assets will be realized 
for  and  the effective tax rates  excluding ns equity in conrail s earnings  were  and  respectively 
for every change in the effective tax rate  net income would have changed by million 
conrail s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity conrail s net income was million in  compared with million in and million in see note 
the increase in was primarily the result of a favorable federal tax settlement 
the improvement in reflected lower casualties and other claims expenses  a favorable adjustment to state income tax reserves and environmental and insurance settlements in conrail s favor 
these positive items were offset in part by the absence of significant gains from the sale of property 
conrail s operating revenues were million in  million in and million in both decreases resulted from the expiration of certain equipment leases and lower operating fees  largely because of reduced operating costs in the shared assets areas 
the decline in also reflected lower revenues at conrail s indiana harbor belt subsidiary 
conrail s operating expenses were million in  million in and million in the decrease in reflected lower expenses for materials  services and rents and compensation and benefits  which were offset  in part  by higher costs for casualties and other claims 
the decline in was primarily due to lower expenses for materials  services and rents  casualties and other claims  and compensation and benefits 
conrail s cash provided by operations decreased million  or  in  and increased million  or  in the decline in was primarily the result of the absence of two items that benefited a million cash payment for transferring to a third party certain rights to license  manage and market signboard advertising on conrail s property for years and proceeds from a favorable insurance settlement 
this was offset  in part  by favorable changes in working capital 
the increase in was largely the result of the two unusual items discussed above 
cash generated from operations is conrail s principal source of liquidity and is primarily used for debt repayments and capital expenditures 
debt repayments totaled million in and million in capital expenditures totaled million in and million in k conrail had a working capital deficit of million at dec 
  compared with working capital of million at dec 
  which included million of amounts receivable from ns and csx 
conrail is not an sec registrant and  therefore  presently cannot issue any publicly traded securities 
conrail is expected to have sufficient cash flow to meet its ongoing obligations 
ns equity in earnings of conrail  net of amortization  was million in  million in and million in ns other comprehensive loss for and  as shown in the consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity  included million and million  respectively  for its portion of conrail s other comprehensive loss see note 
other matters telecommunications subsidiary ns subsidiary  thoroughbred technology and telecommunications  inc t cubed  has developed fiber optic infrastructure with members of the telecommunications industry 
this industry has experienced a severe downturn 
as a result of changes in the values of telecommunications assets  t cubed is monitoring its carrying amount of these assets  as required by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
to date  based on known facts and circumstances  management believes that its ultimate investment in these assets will be recovered  and accordingly  no impairment has been recognized see note 
during  one of t cubed s codevelopers  networks usa  inc 
 filed for protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code and foreign laws 
owes t cubed amounts for work performed on certain joint projects  and t cubed owes amounts for work performed on other joint projects 
the bankruptcy judge has approved set off of these amounts  leaving about million due to t cubed from t cubed has the right to collect this amount from any proceeds due from the sale of joint assets 
management believes that it will collect this receivable 
t cubed is engaged in contract litigation with a second codeveloper  williams communications  llc williams communications  concerning the latter s obligation to purchase fiber optic infrastructure installed by t cubed between cleveland  ohio  and northern virginia 
on jan 
  the united states district court for the northern district of georgia entered an order requiring williams communications to pay t cubed the remaining amount due for such infrastructure  approximately million  plus prejudgment interest at a rate of per annum 
williams communications may elect to appeal 
the ability to collect and retain a judgment against williams communications may be limited due to its financial condition  however  the shortfall  if any  cannot now be determined 
its parent  williams communications group  inc  filed in april a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code  and emerged from bankruptcy in october williams communications was not included in the bankruptcy petition see note 
labor arbitration several hundred claims have been filed with nsr on behalf of employees furloughed after june   for various periods of time  alleging that the furloughs were a result of the conrail transaction and seeking new york dock income protection benefits 
several labor organizations have initiated arbitration on behalf of individual employees 
other disputes are pending wherein similar benefits are sought under labor agreement provisions that  in management s judgment  do not apply to the involved circumstances 
based on known facts  including the availability of legal defenses  management believes that ns will prevail in these disputes and that any potential liability for the involved claims should not have a material adverse effect on ns financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
depending on the outcome of these arbitrations  additional claims may be filed or progressed to arbitration 
should all such claimants prevail  there could be a significant effect on results of operations in a particular quarter see note 
k labor agreements approximately  of ns railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions 
these agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the railway labor act 
moratorium provisions in these agreements permitted ns and the unions to propose such changes in late  negotiations at the national level commenced shortly thereafter 
the outcome of these negotiations is uncertain at this time 
however  agreements have been reached with the brotherhood of maintenance of way employes bmwe  which represents about  ns employees  the brotherhood of locomotive engineers ble  which represents about  ns employees  the united transportation union utu  which represents about  ns employees  the international brotherhood of boilermakers and blacksmiths ibb  which represents about ns employees  and the transportation communications international union tcu  which represents about  ns employees 
health and welfare issues have been resolved with bmwe and tcu 
the utu agreement provides that  subsequent to a further period of negotiation  health and welfare issues may be submitted to arbitration 
health and welfare issues with the other organizations have not yet been resolved 
market risks and hedging activities ns uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
in  ns began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption 
the intent of the program is to assist in the management of ns aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations  which can significantly affect ns operating margins and profitability  through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments 
diesel fuel costs represented of ns operating expenses for the program provides that ns will not enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than months  and that no more than of ns average monthly fuel consumption will be hedged for any month within any month period 
as of dec 
  through swap transactions  ns has hedged approximately of expected diesel fuel requirements 
the effect of the hedges is to yield an average cost of cents per hedged gallon  including federal taxes and transportation 
a decrease in diesel fuel prices would reduce ns asset related to the swaps by approximately million as of dec 
 ns manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floating rate debt instruments and by entering into interest rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio 
at dec 
  ns debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled million excluding debt due to the prr subsidiary 
a increase in interest rates would increase ns total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately million 
management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on ns financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
some of ns capital leases  which carry an average fixed rate of  were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements 
on dec 
  the average pay rate under these agreements was  and the average receive rate was 
during  the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by million 
a portion of the lease obligations is payable in japanese yen 
ns eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen denominated obligation 
most of these deposits are held by foreign banks  primarily japanese 
as a result  ns is exposed to financial market risk relative to japan 
counterparties to the interest rate swaps and japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy 
k new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  sfas no 
which is effective jan 
  and addresses legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
in accordance with the uniform system of accounts for railroad companies see code of federal regulations  title  subtitle b  chapter x  part  ns depreciates track structure rail  other track material and ties to its net salvage value gross salvage less cost to remove 
sfas no 
prohibits the accrual of a liability for removal costs absent a legal obligation to remove the related asset 
management believes that there is no such legal obligation to remove track 
the sec staff has recently taken a position with a registrant in another industry that calls into question whether the use of net salvage that results in depreciating more than the cost basis of an asset negative salvage is appropriate once sfas no 
becomes effective 
ns is in the process of studying its track accounts to determine where current depreciation rates will result in negative salvage 
to the extent that ns accumulated depreciation includes such amounts  they will be removed 
the cumulative effect of this catch up adjustment will be recorded as a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of going forward  this change will result in lower depreciation expense because the depreciation rate will no longer reflect any negative salvage and higher compensation and benefits expenses for the labor cost to remove retired assets  ns does not expect that this will result in a material change to its total railway operating expenses 
the fasb has issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  fin no 
 which addresses consolidation of certain variable interest entities also commonly referred to as special purpose entities 
ns adopted fin no 
 effective jan  as a result  on that date ns consolidated a special purpose entity that leases certain locomotives to ns see note 
this entity has no other significant assets or liabilities other than the locomotives and the debt related to their purchase  which will be reflected on ns consolidated balance sheet in this change in reporting will also have the following effects to ns consolidated income statement beginning in operating lease expense will decline  and depreciation expense and interest expense on debt will increase 
the net effect of these income statement changes is not significant 
adoption of fin no 
did not have a significant effect on ns financial position or liquidity 
inflation generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost in preparing financial statements 
this approach disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property 
ns  a capital intensive company  has most of its capital invested in such assets 
the replacement cost of these assets  as well as the related depreciation expense  would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost 
trends federal economic regulation efforts may be made in to reimpose unwarranted federal economic regulation on the rail industry 
the staggers rail act of  which substantially reduced such regulation  encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business 
ns and other rail carriers will oppose any efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation 
utility deregulation deregulation of the electrical utility industry is expected to increase competition among electric power generators  deregulation over time would permit wholesalers and possibly retailers of electric power to sell or purchase increasing quantities of power to or from distant parties 
the effects of deregulation on ns and on its customers cannot be predicted with certainty  however  ns serves a number of efficient power producers who are expected to remain competitive in this evolving environment 
carbon based fuel there is growing concern in some quarters that emissions resulting from burning carbon based fuel  including coal  are contributing to global warming and causing other environmental changes 
to the extent that these concerns evolve into a consensus among policy makers  the impact could be k either a reduction in the demand for coal or imposition of more stringent regulations on emissions  which might result in making coal a less economical source of power generation or make permitting of coal fired facilities even more difficult 
the revenues and net income of nsr and other railroads that move large quantities of coal could be affected adversely
