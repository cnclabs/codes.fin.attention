depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by  primarily because all the sustain s remaining goodwill of  had been written off as of september  other general and administrative expenses declined by  mainly resulting from less bad debt expense as well as reduced legal fees 
sustain s internal development costs  primarily incremental costs  aggregated  for fiscal compared to  in fiscal during fiscal and  there were  of costs for the development of a new sustain software product by an outside service provider 
after an initial assessment of the development effort and an analysis of the program and product designs  sustain believed that the new software was technologically feasible in accordance with the guidance set forth in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed sfas 
accordingly  the company determined that it needed to capitalize these development costs attributable to the outside service provider 
in march  however  one of sustain s important customers was the first to discover a database locking problem while it was conducting acceptance testing of the software prior to completing installation 
this problem prevented the software from being scalable to a large number of users  which was an important requirement for sustain s customers 
shortly thereafter  sustain determined that correcting the scalability problem would be prohibitively expensive  and therefore the development efforts of the outside provider were discontinued  and its work was terminated 
as a result of these events  sustain concluded that the software was no longer technologically feasible and the company stopped capitalizing costs 
in addition  the company wrote off and expensed the previously capitalized costs aggregating  the company also booked a net tax benefit of  in fiscal based on management s estimate of the timing of the utilization of tax benefits  for financial statement purposes  from overall losses attributable to the sustain segment 
the company s traditional business segment pretax profit increased by  to  from  primarily due to reduced expenses resulting from the decrease in newsprint and printing expenses and the closing of some small regional offices 
in addition  in the company realized a gain from the sale of its sacramento property of  sustain s business segment pretax loss increased by  to  from  excluding the fiscal write off of capitalized software of  primarily due to its software development project 
the consolidated net income for fiscal was  as compared with a net loss of  in fiscal a tax provision was not recorded for fiscal because the company was able to utilize net operating loss carry forwards to offset taxes which otherwise would have been payable 
in addition  the company recorded income tax benefits of  in resulting from the tax law change for the carry back of net operating losses

the cash provided by operating activities of  included a net decrease in prepayments for subscriptions and others of  primarily related to the discontinuance of several small publications in the last quarter of fiscal proceeds from the sale of subscriptions from newspapers  court rule books and other publications and for software maintenance and other services are recorded as deferred revenue and are included in earned revenue only when the services are rendered 
cash flows from operating activities increased by  for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to the prior comparable period primarily due to increased net income 
as of september  the company had working capital of  before deducting the liability for deferred subscription revenues and other revenues of  which will be earned within one year 
during fiscal  and very likely much longer  the company expects its total expenditures in support of the development of the sustain software to continue to be very significant 
in addition  there has never been a resolution of the issues between sustain and the outside software development service provider which was terminated in april the terminated outside service provider filed for bankruptcy in december and stated in its filings with the us bankruptcy court that it was considering bringing a collection action against sustain 
if it ever does  sustain will assert counter claims that completely offset the terminated outside provider s claims 
sustain will vigorously defend any litigation or action brought by the terminated outside service provider  although no assurances can be made as to the ultimate outcome of the dispute 
it is the opinion of management that adequate provision has been made for any amounts that may become due as a result of the dispute 
in a related matter  counsel for the ontario  canada ministry of the solicitor general  ministry of public safety and security and ministry of the attorney general sent a letter to sustain claiming damages of million as a result of sustain s inability to deliver a functional software system due to the flawed work of the outside service provider 
in addition to the legal risks associated with these matters  the pendency of these issues could have an impact on sustain s ability to attract new customers or work with its existing customers 
the company has a real estate loan of  secured by its existing los angeles facilities 
in addition  a bank has expressed interest in lending the company up to an additional million to be secured by the new building and parking facilities  and the company is considering whether to pursue this opportunity 
if the company requires additional funds  it may  among other things  change sustain s development strategy or attempt to secure additional financing  which may or may not be available to the company on acceptable terms 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
management believes that both accounting for capitalized software costs and income tax accounting are critical accounting policies 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed sfas  costs related to the research and development of a new software product are to be expensed as incurred until the technological feasibility of the product is established 
accordingly  costs related to the development of new sustain software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time such costs are capitalized  subject to expected recoverability 
in general  technological feasibility is achieved when the developer has established the necessary skills  hardware and technology to produce a product and a detailed program design has been a completed  b traced to the product specifications and c reviewed for high risk development issues 
in fiscal  the company hired an outside service provider specifically to initially assess the technical feasibility of developing new sustain software products  and the costs of this analysis were expensed 
the service provider delivered a report that included extensive product specifications  an erwin diagram of the system  a detailed architecture analysis and a diagram of the object model 
the product functions  features and technical requirements were set forth in their most detailed logical form  and coding of the new program based in part on sustain s existing commercial case management software program had already begun 
while sustain s customers made it clear that scalability to a large number of users would be an important function of the new software  it would not have been reasonable to conclude at the time that scalability presented a high risk development issue because the outside service provider had already developed a microsoft based architecture specifically designed to handle this requirement 
as discussed above  under sfas  high risk development issues must be resolved before technological feasibility can be established 
consequently  for a period of time prior to the second quarter of fiscal  the company believed that technological feasibility had been established for the new sustain software 
during the course of  the development project began to run over schedule and over budget  but the company was consistently receiving positive progress reports from the outside service provider 
the delays and costs were attributed to factors unrelated to technological feasibility  including a sale of the service provider to a venture capital firm  significant turnover in the service provider s senior and project management and frequent requests for additional functionality and services by sustain s customers 
there was no suggestion of any significant risks to the successful scalability or completion of the software 
in fact  the company received a specific assurance from microsoft corporation  whose technical consultants had reviewed the software  that the sustain application supports extensive scalability 
in march  however  one of sustain s important customers was the first to discover a database locking problem that actually prevented scalability 
the seriousness of the scalability issue was readily apparent and  upon examination  the company came to believe that correcting it could be prohibitively expensive 
the outside service provider estimated that an additional million would be required to fix the problem 
as a result of these developments  the company reconsidered its earlier decision and determined that technological feasibility did not exist 
accordingly  the company stopped capitalizing costs in accordance with the guidance in question of the fasb staff implementation guide to sfas  and the previously capitalized development costs were written off and expensed in their entirety 
these events had no effect on the company s financial statements for or statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position or its results of operations 
in future years  there may be additional tax benefits  for financial statement purposes  from past sustain segment losses
