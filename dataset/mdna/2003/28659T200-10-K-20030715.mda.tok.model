item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general the following discussion and analysis should be read with the financial statements and accompanying notes  included elsewhere in this form k 
it is intended to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating our financial position 
overview we are involved in the development of controlled drug delivery systems and products 
our products are in varying stages of development and testing 
we also conduct research and development  from time to time  on behalf of other pharmaceutical companies although these activities have generated only limited revenue to date 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion addresses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgment  including those related to bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  workers compensation  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
our most critical accounting policies include the recognition of revenue upon completion of certain phases of projects under research and development contracts 
the company also assesses a need for an allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the company assesses its exposure to current commitments and contingencies 
it should be noted that actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
during the year ended march   we elected to prospectively recognize the fair value of stock options granted to employees and members of the board of directors  effective as of the beginning of the fiscal year  which resulted in our taking a charge of  as a result  the prospective method allowed by the financial accounting standards board and related charge did not materially effect our results of operations 
the fair value of stock options granted to employees and members of the board of directors for fiscal years ended after march  may significantly effect the results of operations of future periods  as these awards vest 
year ended march  vs 
year ended march  our auditor s report on the accompanying financial statements states that such financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern 
we have incurred a significant loss and negative cash flows during our fiscal year ended march   which have significantly decreased our working capital and increased our accumulated deficit 
our auditors have stated in their report that these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of the assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
management believes that cost reductions already implemented will reduce losses in the future  and with our existing working capital levels  anticipate that we will be able to continue our operations at least through the end of our current fiscal year 
our revenues for the year ended march  were  a decrease of  over the comparable prior year  or approximately from the prior year 
for the years ended march  and  revenues consisted of product formulation fees of  and  respectively  earned in conjunction with our joint venture in erl 
revenues also consisted of research and development  and testing fees of  and  respectively  earned in conjunction with our distinct development  license and manufacturing agreements 
erl had no revenue after our acquisition of elan s interest in it on september  elan s obligation to make payments to us or to erl terminated upon the termination of the joint venture with elan 
the absence of payments from elan will affect revenues for periods subsequent to september  general and administrative expenses for the year ended march  were  an increase of  or approximately from the prior year 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was substantially due to increases in legal and consulting fees as well as approximately  in expenses resulting from a consent solicitation and a proxy solicitation with regard to the election of our directors 
research and development costs for the year ended march   were  an increase of  or approximately from the prior year 
research and development costs have increased primarily from the result of increased research and development wages  additional biostudies  laboratory supplies and raw materials used in our research and development processes 
we expect our research and development costs to increase in future periods as a result of the erl joint venture termination as we will be solely responsible to fund product development  which we will do from internal resources or through loans or investment by third parties 
we are unable to provide a break down of the specific costs associated with the research and development of each product on which we devoted resources because a significant portion of the costs are generally associated with salaries  laboratory supplies  laboratory and manufacturing expenses  utilities and similar expenses 
we have not historically allocated these expenses to any particular product 
in addition  we cannot estimate the additional costs and expenses that may be incurred in order to potentially complete the development of any product  nor can we estimate the amount of time that might be involved in such development because of the uncertainties associated with the development of controlled release drug delivery products as described in this report 
other expenses for the year ended march  were  an increase of  or approximately from the prior year 
a decrease in equity loss in joint venture of  due to its termination was more than offset by charges related to the exchange of warrants and the issuance of stock options in the amount of  and the reduction in interest income due to lower rates and compensating balances in the amount of  our net loss for the year ended march  was  as compared to  in the prior year  or approximately from the prior year 
the increase in the net loss was primarily due to the decrease in net revenues  and an increase in research and development and administrative expenses associated with the consent solicitation and proxy solicitation with regard to the election of our directors 
our net loss included our equity loss in erl  which was  and  respectively  for the years ended march  and erl s net loss for the years ended march  and was  and  respectively

the decrease in working capital is primarily due to our net loss from operations  our purchase of property and equipment  and the acquisition of our stock on the open market pursuant to our previously announced stock repurchase program  offset by the receipt of  from the issuance of common stock and warrants in connection with the exercise of certain of our class a warrants  certain placement agent warrants issued in connection with our private placement and our receipt of the receivable from the sale of new jersey tax losses 
we experienced negative cash flow from operations of  for the year ended march   primarily due to our net loss from operations of our balance sheet as of march  and statements of redeemable preferred stock and shareholders equity net capital deficiency for the years ended march  and have been restated to present our series a convertible exchangeable preferred stock the series a preferred stock  with a carrying amount of  outside of permanent shareholders equity  as a result of the application of emerging issues task force eitf topic no

we issued the series a preferred stock in connection with the formation of the joint venture with elan in erl 
shares of the series a preferred stock were exchangeable for a portion of our investment in erl 
the series a preferred stock was converted into shares of our common stock during our fiscal year ended march  the effect of this restatement was to reduce total shareholders equity by  for the periods presented and is set forth in the table below

financing activities utilized net cash of  during the year ended march  and provided net cash of million during the year ended march  net cash used in financing activities during the year ended march  resulted primarily from the repurchase of stock and the repayment of indebtedness  offset in part by the sale of common stock and warrants 
net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended march  resulted primarily from the sale of common stock and warrants and proceeds of bank note  offset in part by the repayment of indebtedness 
our capital expenditures aggregated  and  for the years ended march  and  respectively 
such expenditures consisted primarily of the acquisition of property and equipment necessary to support our existing operations and expected growth 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures for our fiscal year ending march  will be limited to expenditures that can be funded entirely by development contracts that include provisions for such funding for these expenditures 
these expenditures substantially would relate to the acquisition of property and equipment in connection with our operations 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  we have outstanding  in aggregate amount of bonds 
the bonds bear interest at a rate of per annum and are due on various dates between and thereafter 
the bonds are secured by a first lien on our facility in northvale  new jersey 
pursuant to the terms of the bonds  several restricted cash accounts have been established for the payment of bond principal and interest 
bond proceeds were utilized for the refinancing of the land and building we currently own  for the purchase of certain manufacturing equipment and related building improvements and the maintenance of a  debt service reserve 
all of the restricted cash  other than the debt service reserve  is expected to be expended within twelve months and is therefore categorized as a current asset on our consolidated balance sheet as of march  pursuant to terms of the bond indenture agreement pursuant to which the bonds were issued  we are required to observe certain covenants  including covenants relating to the incurrence of additional indebtedness  the granting of liens and the maintenance of certain financial covenants 
as of march   we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the bond indenture agreement 
as a result of the significant expenditures associated with the proxy solicitation in our fiscal year ended march   the joint venture termination and other legal and accounting expenses  quarterly cash expenses far exceeded our generated revenues in in order to conserve cash in fiscal year  we intend to reduce costs by reducing the number of products under active development to six 
however  while we anticipate having adequate capital to support our operations through at least the end of our current fiscal year  we will need to raise capital and or generate additional revenues in order to support our operations beyond that time 
to the extent that revenues do not meet expectations or our cost cutting measures do not become effective  we will need to raise additional capital sooner 
we also  from time to time  consider potential strategic transactions including acquisitions  strategic alliances  joint ventures and licensing arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies 
there can be no assurance that any such transaction will be available or consummated in the future 
reference is made to risk factors for a description of certain risks that may affect the achievement of our objectives and results discussed herein 
as of march   our principal source of liquidity was approximately  of cash and cash equivalents 
additionally  we may have access to funds of approximately  that may be generated from the potential sale of new jersey tax losses 
there can be no assurance that the sale of tax losses will materialize or come to fruition or that such funds will become available
