at t or the company is among the world s communications leaders  providing voice and data communications services to large and small businesses  consumers and government agencies 
we provide domestic and international long distance  regional and local communications services  and data and internet communications services 
restructuring of at t in conjunction with the restructuring of at t announced on october   at t broadband  at t wireless  and liberty media corporation have all been separated from at t 
on november   at t spun off at t broadband which was primarily comprised of the at t broadband segment to at t shareowners 
simultaneously  at t broadband combined with comcast corporation comcast 
the combination was accomplished through a distribution of stock to at t shareowners  who received of a share shares adjusted for the for reverse stock split of comcast class a common stock for each share of at t they owned at market close on november   the record date 
the internal revenue service irs ruled that the transaction qualified as tax free for at t and its shareowners for us federal income tax purposes  with the exception of cash received for fractional shares 
approximately billion new comcast shares were issued to at t shareowners at a value of approximately billion  based on the comcast stock price on november  at t shareowners received a economic stake and a voting interest in new comcast 
in connection with the non pro rata spin off of at t broadband  at t wrote up the net assets of at t broadband to fair value 
this resulted in a noncash gain of billion  which represented the difference between the fair value of the at t broadband business at the date of the spin off and at t s book value in at t broadband  net of certain charges triggered by the spin off and their related income tax effect 
these charges included compensation expense due to the accelerated vesting of stock options as well as the enhancement of certain incentive plans 
the gain was recorded in as a gain on disposition of discontinued operations 
on august   at t completed the split off of liberty media corporation as an independent  publicly traded company 
since  at the time of disposition  at t did not exit the line of business that liberty media group lmg operated in  lmg was not accounted for as a discontinued operation 
at t redeemed each outstanding share of class a and class b liberty media group lmg tracking stock for one share of liberty media corporation s series a and series b common stock  respectively 
the irs ruled that the split off of liberty media corporation qualified as a tax free transaction for at t  liberty media and their shareowners 
for accounting purposes  the deemed effective split off date was july  the operating results from august   through august   were deemed immaterial to our consolidated results 
the lmg tracking stock  which had reflected of the performance of lmg  was issued in in connection with at t s acquisition of tele communications  inc tci 
at t did not have a controlling financial interest in lmg for financial accounting purposes  therefore  at t s ownership in lmg was reflected as an investment accounted for under the equity method in at t s consolidated financial statements 
the amounts attributable to lmg are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as equity losses earnings from liberty media group prior to its split off from at t 
on july   at t completed the split off of at t wireless as a separate  independently traded company 
all at t wireless group tracking stock was converted into at t wireless common stock on a one for one basis and  million shares of at t wireless common stock held by at t were distributed to at t common shareowners on a basis of of a share shares adjusted for the for reverse stock split of at t wireless for each at t share outstanding 
at t common shareowners received whole shares of at t wireless and cash payments for fractional shares 
the irs ruled that the transaction qualified as tax free for at t and its shareowners for us federal income tax purposes  with the exception of cash received for fractional shares 
for accounting purposes  the deemed effective split off date was june  the impact of operating results from july  through july   were deemed immaterial to our consolidated results 
the split off of at t wireless resulted in a noncash tax free gain of billion  which represented the difference between the fair value of the at t wireless tracking stock at the date of the split off and at t s book value in at t wireless 
this gain was recorded in as a gain on disposition of discontinued operations 
at the time of split off  at t retained approximately billion  or  of at t wireless common stock 
at t issued the at t wireless tracking stock in april  to track the financial performance of at t wireless group 
the shares initially issued tracked approximately of the performance of at t wireless group 
the earnings attributable to at t wireless group are excluded from the earnings available to at t common stock group and are included in net loss from discontinued operations 
similarly  the earnings and losses related to lmg are excluded from the earnings available to at t common stock group 
the remaining results of operations of at t  including the financial performance of at t wireless group not represented by the tracking stock  is referred to as the at t common stock group and is represented by at t common stock

the discussion and analysis that follows provides information management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of at t s consolidated results of operations for the years ended december    and  and financial condition as of december  and critical accounting estimates and judgments at t s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management continually evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to useful lives of plant and equipment  pension and other postretirement benefits  income taxes and legal contingencies 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment see note to the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of at t s significant accounting policies estimated useful lives of plant and equipment we estimate the useful lives of plant and equipment in order to determine the amount of depreciation and amortization expense to be recorded during any reporting period 
the majority of our telecommunications plant and equipment is depreciated using the group method  which develops a depreciation rate annually based on the average useful life of a specific group of assets  rather than the individual asset as would be utilized under the unit method 
such estimated life of the group changes as the composition of the group of assets changes and their related lives 
the estimated life of the group is based on historical experience with similar assets as well as taking into account anticipated technological or other changes 
if technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated or in a different form than anticipated  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense in future periods 
likewise  if the anticipated technological or other changes occur more slowly than anticipated  the life of the group could be extended based on the life assigned to new assets added to the group 
this could result in a reduction of depreciation and amortization expense in future periods 
a one year decrease or increase in the useful life of these assets would increase or decrease depreciation and amortization expense by approximately billion 
we review these types of assets for impairment annually  or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be not be recoverable over the remaining lives of the assets 
in assessing impairments  we follow the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  utilizing cash flows which take into account management s estimates of future operations 
pension and postretirement benefits the amounts recognized in the financial statements related to pension and postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing several different assumptions 
a significant assumption used in determining our net pension credit income and postretirement benefit expense is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
in  we used an expected long term rate of return of 
for  we will lower this expected rate of return to 
in determining this revised rate  we considered the current and projected investment portfolio mix and estimated long term investment returns for each asset class 
the projected portfolio mix of the plan assets is developed in consideration of the expected duration of related plan obligations and as such is more heavily weighted toward equity investments  including public and private equity positions 
plan assets also include fixed income and real estate investments 
the actual return on pension plan assets over the last and years has been and  respectively  although the return for the last two years has been negative 
the expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the expected long term rate of return to the market related value of plan assets 
the market related value is a calculated value that amortizes the difference between actual and expected returns evenly over a five year period 
the combined market related value of plan assets of the pension and postretirement benefit plans as of december   was approximately billion  about billion higher than the related fair value of plan assets 
the expected return on assets of the pension and postretirement benefit plans included in operating income was income of billion 
the reduction in the expected long term rate of return to will reduce the expected return credit by approximately billion in another significant estimate is the discount rate used in the annual actuarial valuation of pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations 
in determining the appropriate discount rate at year end  we considered the current yields on high quality corporate fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the benefit obligations 
as of december   we reduced the discount rate by basis points to 
changes in the discount rate do not have a material impact on our results of operations 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided for the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts recognized for income tax purposes 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that  if changed  would result in either an increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes in the period of change 
a one percentage point increase in the enacted federal income tax rate as of december   would decrease net income by approximately billion 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  management considers estimates of future taxable income  the character of income needed to realize future tax benefits  and all available evidence 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and have accrued amounts that represent our estimate of the probable outcome of these matters 
such estimates of outcome are derived from consultation with outside counsel  as well as an assessment of litigation and settlement strategies 
in addition  we may be responsible for a portion of certain legal proceedings associated with former affiliates pursuant to separation and distribution agreements 
such agreements provide at t to share in the cost of certain litigation relating to matters while affiliated with at t if a judgment or settlement exceeds certain thresholds 
with the exception of the sparks matter see discontinued operations discussion  as of december   we are not aware of  and have not been advised of  any matters in which it is probable that costs would be incurred in excess of the thresholds above which we would be required to share in the costs 
however  in the event these former subsidiaries were unable to meet their obligations with respect to these liabilities due to financial difficulties  at t could be held responsible for all or a portion of these costs  irrespective of the sharing agreements 
depending on how these matters are resolved  these costs could be material 
consolidated results of operations the comparison of results with results was impacted by the april   unwind of concert  our joint venture with british telecommunications plc bt 
the venture s assets and customer accounts were distributed back to the parent companies 
under the partnership termination agreement  each of the partners generally reclaimed the customer contracts and assets that were initially contributed to the joint venture  including international transport facilities and gateway assets 
in addition  at t assumed certain other assets that bt originally contributed to the joint venture 
as a result  results include revenue and expenses associated with these customers and businesses for the period april  through december   while and the first quarter of includes our proportionate share of concert s earnings and related charges in net losses related to other equity investments 
in addition  the assets reclaimed are consolidated in each line item of the consolidated balance sheet at december   versus an equity investment in concert at december   included in other assets 
for the period august   through december   at t s interest in at t latin america was fully consolidated in at t s results 
in december  at t signed a non binding term sheet for the sale of its economic interest voting interest in at t latin america and began accounting for at t latin america as an asset held for sale the operations of at t latin america did not qualify for treatment as a discontinued operation 
as a result of this action  as well as our belief that no changes to the plan will be made and that a sale will be completed within one year  we recorded an impairment charge of billion to write down at t latin america s assets and liabilities to fair value  and reclassified these assets and liabilities to other current assets and other current liabilities at december  the consolidated financial statements of at t reflect at t broadband and at t wireless as discontinued operations 
at t broadband was spun off on november   and at t wireless was split off on july  accordingly  the revenue  costs and expenses and cash flows of at t broadband and at t wireless have been excluded from the respective captions in the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows  and have been reported through their respective dates of separation as net loss from discontinued operations and as net cash used in provided by discontinued operations 
in addition  the assets and liabilities of at t broadband have been excluded from the respective captions in the consolidated balance sheet at december   and have been reported as current assets of discontinued operations  non current assets of discontinued operations  current liabilities of discontinued operations  non current liabilities of discontinued operations  minority interest of discontinued operations  and company obligated convertible quarterly income preferred securities of subsidiary trust holding solely subordinated debt securities of at t of discontinued operations 
a for reverse stock split of at t common stock was effected on november  shares except shares authorized  per share amounts and stock prices were restated to reflect the stock split on a retroactive basis 
in addition  our stock prices were restated to reflect the at t broadband disposition 
effective july   the fcc eliminated primary interexchange carrier charges picc or per line charges that at t pays for residential and single line business long distance customers 
the elimination of these per line charges resulted in lower access expense as well as lower revenue  since at t has historically billed its customers for these charges 
revenue for the years ended december  dollars in millions at t business services    at t consumer services    corporate and other total revenue    total revenue decreased  or billion  in compared with  and decreased  or billion  in compared with the decrease in both years was largely driven by continued declines in long distance voice revenue of approximately billion in and billion in in addition  revenue declined by billion due to the elimination of picc 
the long distance voice decline reflects the impact of pricing pressures and substitution  including a shift from higher priced products such as business retail to lower priced products such as business wholesale and prepaid cards 
partially offsetting the declines was growth in data internet protocol ip managed services within at t business services and local voice services within both at t consumer services and at t business services of approximately billion in  and billion in the variances include a positive impact attributable to the reintegration of customers and assets from the unwind of concert 
in  we expect our long distance voice revenue to continue to decline due to ongoing competition and product substitution 
this decline in revenue is expected to be partially offset by growth in our local voice services and data ip managed services 
revenue by segment is discussed in greater detail in the segment results section 
for the years ended december  dollars in millions access and other connection    costs of services and products    selling  general and administrative    depreciation and amortization    net restructuring and other charges   total operating expenses    operating income    operating margin included within access and other connection expenses are costs we pay to connect calls using the facilities of other service providers  as well as the universal service fund contributions and per line charges mandated by the fcc 
costs paid to telephone companies outside of the united states to connect international calls are also included within access and other connection expenses 
access and other connection expenses decreased  or billion  in compared with approximately billion of this decrease was due to lower universal service fund contributions and lower per line charges  which were primarily driven by the decline in long distance voice revenue 
in addition  domestic access charges decreased by billion primarily due to product mix and fcc mandated access rate reductions 
international connection charges decreased by approximately billion driven primarily by lower rates and the reintegration of customers and assets from the unwind of concert 
these reductions were partially offset by an increase in local connectivity costs 
since most of the universal service fund contributions  per minute access rate reductions and per line charges are passed through to the customer  these reductions generally result in a corresponding reduction in revenue 
in  we expect access rates to be flat or slightly lower than as most of the fcc mandated rate reductions have been implemented 
we also expect our local connectivity costs to continue to increase as we continue to grow our local voice business 
access and other connection expenses decreased  or billion  in compared with approximately billion of the decrease was due to mandated reductions in per minute access rates  lower per line charges and lower international connection rates 
in july  per line charges that at t paid for residential and single line business customers were eliminated by the fcc 
these reductions were partially offset by a billion increase due to overall volume growth primarily related to local and international services and higher universal service fund contributions 
costs of services and products include the costs of operating and maintaining our networks  costs to support our outsourcing contracts  the provision for uncollectible receivables and other service related costs  including the cost of equipment sold 
costs of services and products decreased billion  or  in compared with approximately billion of the decrease was due to the overall impact of lower revenue and related costs at at t consumer services and at t business services 
in addition  costs decreased approximately billion due to losses on certain long term contracts recorded in by at t business services 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of billion in at t business services provision for uncollectible receivables primarily attributable to the weak economy 
cost of services and products also increased as a result of the reintegration of customers and assets from the unwind of concert 
in  these costs increased billion  or  compared with the increase was driven by approximately billion of higher costs associated with our growth businesses  primarily at at t business services  including the cost of equipment sold 
in addition  costs increased approximately billion due to estimated losses on certain long term contracts at at t business services and a lower pension credit income primarily due to the lower expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the effects of lower actual plan assets 
these increases were partially offset by approximately billion of lower costs associated with decreased revenue  primarily lower volumes at at t business services  including our international operations  and lower payphone compensation costs 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased million  or  in compared with this decrease was driven by a reduction in the number of residential customers as well as cost control efforts of billion  and lower transaction costs of billion associated with the at t restructuring 
partially offsetting these decreases was billion of lower pension credits income primarily due to the lower expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the effects of lower actual plan assets  and billion associated with increased marketing and sales expenses for new local consumer service offerings and increased investment for business sales and customer care development 
sg a expenses also increased as a result of the reintegration of customers and assets from the unwind of concert 
we expect sg a expenses  and to a lesser extent costs of services and products  will be unfavorably impacted in the future due to lower pension credits income and higher post retirement expenses resulting from a lower expected long term rate of return on plan assets in of compared with the rate used in and the effects of lower actual plan assets 
we also expect sg a expenses to be impacted by higher compensation costs associated with stock options reflecting the decision to expense stock option grants  commencing with options granted in sg a expenses increased billion  or  in compared with increased expenses in support of growth businesses  primarily data ip managed services  and local voice services  drove approximately billion of the increase 
these expenses included infrastructure development costs associated with increased sales headcount  advertising  and other general and administrative expenses 
a lower pension credit income and higher postretirement expense resulting from decreased return on plan assets  combined with higher compensation accruals  contributed approximately billion to the increase 
also included in the increased sg a expenses were transaction costs of approximately billion associated with at t s restructuring announced in october partially offsetting these increases was the impact of cost control efforts as well as decreased customer care and billing expenses of approximately billion  primarily from at t consumer services 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased billion  or  in compared with the increase was primarily due to a larger asset base resulting from continued infrastructure investment supporting our growth business 
the increase was partially offset by the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets as of january   which eliminated the amortization of goodwill 
in  we recorded billion of amortization expense on goodwill 
in  the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires that obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets be recorded as liabilities only if such liability is unavoidable and legally enforceable  will have a favorable impact on depreciation expense 
see new accounting pronouncements for a further discussion of sfas no 
however  we continue to invest in our asset base  which will increase depreciation expense in depreciation and amortization expenses increased million in compared with the increase was primarily due to a larger asset base resulting from continued infrastructure investment 
certain infrastructure assets placed in service in extended the average life of the overall assets  partially mitigating the impact of the larger asset base 
total capital expenditures were billion  billion and billion for  and  respectively 
the decrease in spending was primarily due to cost containment efforts 
we continue to focus the majority of our capital spending on our growth businesses of data ip managed services 
in  net restructuring and other charges were  million 
the net charge included  million related to at t business services  million related to at t consumer services and million related to the corporate and other group 
included in the  million was a  million charge for the impairment of the net assets of our consolidated subsidiary  at t latin america 
in december  the at t board of directors approved a plan for at t to sell its approximate voting stake in at t latin america in its current condition 
on december   at t signed a non binding term sheet for the sale of our shares within one year for a nominal amount 
as a result of this plan  we classified at t latin america as an asset held for sale at fair market value  in accordance with sfas no 
consequently  there are approximately million of assets principally cash and accounts receivable included in other current assets and approximately million of liabilities principally secured short term debt included in other current liabilities 
the  million charge to write the assets and liabilities down to their fair values was reported within our at t business services segment 
also included in net restructuring and other charges was a million impairment charge related to certain digital subscriber line dsl assets including internal use software  licenses  and property  plant equipment that will not be utilized by at t as result of changes to our dsl build strategy 
instead of building dsl capabilities in all geographic areas initially targeted  we have signed an agreement with covad communications to offer dsl services over their network 
as a result  the assets in these areas were impaired 
this charge was reported within our at t consumer services segment 
in  at t recorded net business restructuring charges of million 
these activities consisted of new exit plans totaling million and reversals of million 
the new plans primarily consisted of million for employee separation costs primarily in at t business services  and million of facility closing reserves 
slightly more than  employees will be separated in conjunction with these exit plans  approximately one half of which are management employees and one half are non management employees 
the majority of these employee separations will be involuntary and are largely the result of improved processes and automation in provisioning and maintenance of services for business customers 
due to the timing of these separations  these exit plans did not yield cash savings in  nor did we realize a benefit to operating income in future cash and expense savings is dependent upon the timing of actual separations and associated payments 
in the first full year following the completion of these exit plans  we expect to realize approximately million of cash savings and benefit to operating income 
approximately of the employees affected by these exit plans had left their positions by december   and we expect those remaining to leave their positions by the end of termination benefits of approximately million were paid throughout for the current and prior year s separation plans 
the million reversal primarily consisted of million of employee separation costs and million related to prior plan facility closings no longer deemed to be necessary 
the reversals were primarily due to management s determination that the restructuring plan established in the fourth quarter of for certain areas of at t business services  including network services  needed to be modified given current industry conditions  as well as the redeployment of certain employees to different functions within the company 
during  net restructuring and other charges were  million which were primarily comprised of million for employee separations  of which million related to benefits to be paid from pension assets as well as pension and postretirement curtailment losses  and million for facility closings 
the restructuring and exit plans support our cost reduction efforts through headcount reductions across all segments of the business  primarily network support and customer care functions in at t business services 
these charges were slightly offset by the reversal of million related to business restructuring plans announced in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of which million related to employee separations and million related to contract terminations 
the net charge consisted of million related to at t business services  million related to at t consumer services and million related to the corporate and other group 
the charge covered separation costs for approximately  employees  approximately one half of whom were management and one half were non management employees 
more than  employee separations related to involuntary terminations and the remaining  were voluntary 
during  we recorded million of net restructuring and other charges which included million for employee separations associated with at t s initiative to reduce costs  of which million primarily related to pension and postretirement curtailment losses 
the charge also included million related to the government mandated disposition of at t communications uk ltd  which would have competed directly with concert  and million of network lease and other contract termination costs associated with penalties incurred as part of notifying vendors of the termination of these contracts during the year 
the net charge consisted of million related to at t business services  million related to at t consumer services and million related to the corporate and other group 
these plans covered separation costs for approximately  employees  mainly in at t business services  including network operations  primarily for the consolidation of customer care and call centers 
approximately one half of whom were management employees and one half were non management employees 
approximately  of the employee separations related to involuntary terminations and approximately related to voluntary terminations 
at t s operating income in decreased billion  or  compared with and decreased billion  or  in compared with at t s operating margin was in compared with in and in the decline in was primarily due to the decline in revenue combined with increased net restructuring and other charges and increased depreciation and amortization expenses 
also contributing to the decline was a lower rate of decline in selling  general and administrative expenses and costs of services and products compared with the revenue rate of decline 
the decline in operating margin in was primarily due to a decline in revenue combined with increased selling  general and administrative expenses  costs of services and products  net restructuring and other charges  and depreciation and amortization expenses 
the operating margin declines in both years reflect pricing pressures and a shift from higher margin retail long distance services to lower margin wholesale long distance service and other lower margin services such as lower priced optional calling plans and prepaid cards 
we expect the operating margin to continue to decline in despite the expected benefit from lower net restructuring and other charges 
the expected decline is primarily due to a continued decline in the long distance business reflecting the impact of accelerating growth in wholesale services as well as a shift to lower margin services such as lower priced optional calling plans and prepaid cards 
for the years ended december  dollars in millions other expense income   other expense income in was expense of million compared with income of billion in the unfavorable variance of billion was primarily due to billion of higher net gains on sales of businesses and investments in  including gains on the sale of at t s retained interest in at t wireless and japan telecom 
the unfavorable variance was also due to impairments of billion recorded in related to certain leases of aircraft which are accounted for as leveraged leases  billion of lower income related to mark to market adjustments on derivative instruments and lower investment related income of billion 
favorably impacting other expense income were lower investment impairment charges of billion in  primarily driven by lower impairment charges for time warner telecom 
at december   we had investments in leveraged leases of aircraft of million 
million net of deferred taxes  which we lease to airlines as well as aircraft related companies 
several airline carriers who have leases have recently experienced financial difficulties 
while these airlines are current on their lease rental payments  we could record additional impairment charges in if any of these carriers declare bankruptcy or renegotiate their lease terms with us 
in addition  in the event of bankruptcy or a renegotiation of lease terms  if any portion of the non recourse debt is canceled  such amounts would result in taxable income to at t and accordingly a cash tax expense 
other expense income in was income of billion compared with income of billion in the favorable variance of billion was driven primarily by higher net gains on the sales of businesses and investments of billion which reflect the gains on the sales of at t s retained interest in at t wireless and japan telecom in  billion related to the settlement  in  of disputes relating to the buyer s obligations resulting from the sale of at t universal card services  and higher income related to mark to market adjustments on derivative instruments of billion 
partially offsetting these increases was investment impairment charges of billion  primarily consisting of the impairment of time warner telecom  and lower interest income of billion 
for the years ended december  dollars in millions interest expense    interest expense decreased million  or  in compared with  and decreased million  or  in compared with the decrease in both periods was primarily due to lower average debt balances  reflecting our debt reduction efforts  partially offset by higher average interest rates 
average interest rates were higher in both periods due to the mix of short term and long term debt 
the average rate was adversely affected by the billion bond offering in november we expect interest expense to be lower in future periods as a result of our debt reduction efforts 
for the years ended december  dollars in millions provision for income taxes    effective tax rate the effective tax rate is the provision for income taxes as a percent of income from continuing operations before income taxes 
the rate was adversely impacted by approximately percentage points due to the billion impairment charge recorded in relating to at t s interest in at t latin america for which no tax benefit was recorded 
also negatively impacting the rate was the impact of at t latin america s losses from operations for which no tax benefit was recorded because realization of a tax benefit was not likely to occur and the losses were not includable in at t s consolidated income tax return 
in  the effective tax rate was positively impacted by tax benefits associated with the tax free gain from the disposal of a portion of at t s retained interest in at t wireless in a debt for equity exchange  partially offset by the consolidation of at t latin america s pretax losses for which no tax benefit was provided 
in  the effective tax rate was positively impacted by the tax benefits associated with certain legal entity restructurings and investments 
for the years ended december  dollars in millions minority interest income minority interest income represents an adjustment to at t s income to reflect the less than ownership of consolidated subsidiaries 
minority interest income decreased million in compared with as a result of lower net losses of at t latin america in in december  at t fully utilized the minority interest balance related to at t latin america  therefore  we will no longer record minority interest income related to at t latin america 
minority interest income increased billion in compared with primarily due to at t latin america  which we acquired on august   therefore  includes a full year of results  compared with a partial year in for the years ended december  dollars in millions equity losses earnings from liberty media group   equity losses earnings from lmg  which are recorded net of income taxes  were a loss of billion in  compared with earnings of billion in the decline of billion was largely driven by gains on dispositions recorded in  including gains associated with the mergers of various companies that lmg had investments in  as well as higher stock compensation expense in compared with partially offsetting these declines were lower impairment charges recorded on lmg s investments to reflect other than temporary declines in value 
equity losses for reflect results through july   the deemed effective date of the split off 
for the years ended december  dollars in millions net losses earnings related to other equity investments  net losses related to other equity investments  which are recorded net of income taxes  declined billion in compared with due to lower net losses of billion for concert  billion for at t canada and billion for netphone  primarily resulting from impairment charges recorded in net losses related to other equity investments  net of income taxes  were billion in compared with income of million in the unfavorable variance of billion was primarily due to greater losses of billion for concert  billion for at t canada and billion for netphone primarily due to impairment charges recorded in the after tax amortization of excess basis associated with nonconsolidated investments  recorded as a reduction of income  totaled million in  and million in effective january   in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we no longer amortize excess basis related to nonconsolidated investments 
for the years ended december  dollars in millions net loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes    gain on disposition of discontinued operations   net loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  primarily represents the operating results of at t broadband and at t wireless  which at t disposed of and accounted for as discontinued operations 
accordingly  the revenue  costs and expenses of at t broadband and at t wireless have been excluded from the respective captions in the consolidated statements of operations 
in  the net loss from discontinued operations included a loss of billion from the discontinued operations of at t broadband  and an estimated loss on the litigation settlement associated with the business of lucent technologies inc  which was spun off from at t in and accounted for as a discontinued operation 
sparks  et al 
v 
at t and lucent technologies inc et al  was a class action lawsuit filed in in illinois state court 
on august   a settlement proposal was submitted to and accepted by the court 
in accordance with the separation and distribution agreement between at t and lucent technologies inc  at t recorded its proportionate share of the settlement and estimated legal costs  which totaled million  net of tax 
depending upon the number of claims submitted and accepted  the actual cost of the settlement to at t may be less than stated amounts  but it is not possible to estimate the amount at this time 
in  we realized a noncash gain on the disposition of at t broadband of billion  which represented the difference between the fair value of at t broadband at the date of the spin off and at t s book value  net of certain charges triggered by the spin off of million  and the related income tax effect of million 
these charges included compensation expense due to the accelerated vesting of stock options as well as the enhancement of certain incentive plans 
in  the net loss from discontinued operations included a loss of billion from the discontinued operations of at t broadband  and income of million from the discontinued operations of at t wireless 
in  we realized a tax free noncash gain on the disposition of discontinued operations of billion  representing the difference between the fair value of the at t wireless tracking stock at the date of the split off and at t s book value 
in  the net loss from discontinued operations consisted of a loss of billion from the discontinued operations of at t broadband  and income of million from the discontinued operations of at t wireless 
for the years ended december  dollars in millions cumulative effect of accounting changes effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 franchise costs were tested for impairment as of january   by comparing the fair value to the carrying value at the market level 
as a result of this test  an impairment loss related to discontinued operations of billion  net of income taxes of billion  was recorded in effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the cumulative effect of this accounting change  net of applicable income taxes  was comprised of billion for at t group of which billion related to discontinued operations and billion for lmg 
the billion recorded by at t group was attributable primarily to fair value adjustments of equity derivative instruments embedded in indexed debt instruments and warrants held in public and private companies 
the billion recorded by lmg represents the impact of separately recording the embedded call option obligations associated with lmg s senior exchangeable debentures 
for the years ended december  dollars in millions dividend requirements of preferred stock premium on exchange of at t wireless tracking stock dividend requirements of preferred stock were billion in the preferred stock dividend represented interest in connection with convertible preferred stock issued to ntt docomo in january of as well as accretion of the beneficial conversion feature associated with this preferred stock 
the beneficial conversion feature was computed upon the issuance of the ntt docomo preferred stock and represented the excess of the fair value of the preferred shares issued over the proceeds received 
this beneficial feature was being accreted over the time period docomo was required to hold the shares 
on july   in conjunction with the split off of at t wireless group  these preferred shares were converted into at t wireless common stock 
as a result  the beneficial conversion feature was fully accreted 
in may  at t completed an exchange offer of at t common stock for at t wireless tracking stock 
in  this exchange resulted in a premium of million  which was a reduction of net income available to common shareowners 
the premium represented the excess of the fair value of the at t wireless tracking stock issued over the fair value of the at t common stock exchanged and was calculated based on the closing share prices of at t common stock and at t wireless tracking stock on may  segment results at t s results are segmented according to the customers we service at t business services and at t consumer services 
the balance of at t s continuing operations excluding lmg is included in a corporate and other group 
this group primarily reflects corporate staff functions and the elimination of transactions between segments 
the discussion of segment results includes revenue  earnings before interest and taxes ebit  capital additions and total assets 
ebit is the primary measure used by at t s chief operating decision makers to measure at t s operating results and to measure segment profitability and performance 
at t calculates ebit as operating income plus other expense income  net  pretax minority interest income and pretax net losses earnings related to other equity investments 
interest and income taxes are not factored into the segment profitability measure used by the chief operating decision makers  therefore  trends for these items are discussed on a consolidated basis 
management believes ebit is meaningful to investors because it provides an analysis of operating results using the same measure used by at t s chief operating decision makers 
ebit for at t was billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we provide ebit  a measure not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  for at t in order to provide investors a means to evaluate the financial results of each segment in relation to total at t 
the table below provides a reconciliation of ebit to operating income 
our calculations of ebit may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other public companies 
ebit should not be viewed by investors as an alternative to a gaap measure of performance  such as operating income 
reconciliation of ebit to operating income for the years ended december  dollars in millions ebit    deduct other expense income   minority interest income pretax net losses related to other equity investments  operating income    total assets for each segment generally include all assets  except intercompany receivables 
prepaid pension assets and corporate owned or leased real estate are generally held at the corporate level  and therefore are included in the corporate and other group 
the total assets of discontinued operations and the related loss as well as the gain on disposition are not reflected in the corporate and other group 
capital additions for each segment include capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment  additions to nonconsolidated investments and additions to internal use software 
our existing segments reflect certain managerial changes that were implemented during the changes primarily include the following revenue previously recorded by the at t business services segment as internal revenue for services provided to certain other at t units and then eliminated within the corporate and other group is now recorded as a contra expense by at t business services  the results of certain units previously included in the corporate and other group were transferred to the at t business services segment  the financial impacts of sfas no 
that were previously recorded in the corporate and other group were transferred to the appropriate segments 
in addition  at t consumer services and total at t revenue was restated in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer  which requires cash incentives given to customers previously recorded as advertising and promotion expense now to be recorded as a reduction of revenue when recognized in the income statement  unless an identifiable benefit is received in exchange 
all prior periods have been restated to reflect these changes 
reflecting the dynamics of our business  we continuously review our management model and structure  which may result in additional adjustments to our operating segments in the future 
at t business services at t business services offers a variety of global communications services to small and medium sized businesses  large domestic and multinational businesses and government agencies 
their services include long distance  international  toll free and local voice  data and ip services  managed services  and wholesale transport services sales of services to service resellers

for the years ended december  dollars in millions external revenue services revenue    equipment and product sales total external revenue    internal revenue total revenue    ebit    capital additions    at december  total assets   revenue at t business services revenue decreased billion  or  in compared with  and decreased billion  or in compared with the declines were primarily driven by a decline in long distance voice revenue of billion in and billion in partially offsetting the decline was growth in data ip managed services  including equipment sales  and local voice services of billion in and billion in in  we expect long distance voice revenue will continue to decline  reflecting continued competitive pressure as well as an accelerating shift in the retail wholesale mix 
we expect the declines in long distance voice revenue will continue to be partially offset by growth in local and data ip managed services 
long distance voice revenue declined approximately in compared with  and approximately in compared with  reflecting the continued impact of pricing pressures and a change in the wholesale retail product mix 
while long distance volumes grew at a low single digit rate in and  the increase was driven by growth in lower priced wholesale volumes that was essentially offset by a decrease in higher priced retail volumes 
these factors are expected to continue to negatively impact revenue in data ip managed services  excluding equipment and product sales  increased approximately in compared with growth was driven by increased sales in packet services  which grew at a rate of approximately  partially offset by a decline in private line services a service in which the connection is dedicated to the customer  reflecting an industry trend of customers migrating from private line services to more cost effective and technologically advanced packet services 
when we include equipment and product sales  data ip managed services increased approximately 
data ip managed services increased approximately in compared with  with or without the impact of equipment sales 
the growth was led by packet services  which grew at a mid percent rate 
local voice services revenue grew approximately in compared with and more than in compared with this growth reflects our continued focus on increasing the utilization of our existing footprint 
at t added approximately  access lines in access lines at the end of and were approximately million and million  respectively 
at t business services internal revenue decreased billion in compared with and was relatively flat in compared with the impact of internal revenue is included in the revenue by product discussions  above 
the decrease in internal revenue in compared with was primarily due to the split off of at t wireless on july   as these sales are now reported as external revenue  partially offset by an increase in sales to at t broadband 
sales to at t broadband were recorded as internal revenue through the november   date of disposition 
subsequent to november   sales to at t broadband  now comcast  are recorded as external revenue 
ebit in  ebit increased billion  or  compared with the improvement was primarily due to a decrease in pretax net losses related to equity investments of billion for concert and billion for at t canada driven primarily by impairment charges and equity losses recorded in  as well as billion in lower restructuring charges recorded in this improvement was partially offset by a decrease in the long distance voice business resulting primarily from the impact of pricing pressures  a billion impairment charge recorded in for at t latin america  and a gain of approximately billion recorded on the sale of our stake in japan telecom in in  ebit decreased billion  or  compared with the decline was primarily due to higher losses of billion related to concert and billion related to at t canada  primarily due to impairment charges recorded in also reflected in the decline was the impact of long distance voice pricing pressure  as well as a shift from higher margin long distance services to lower margin growth services 
other items capital additions decreased billion in compared with and billion in compared with as we continue to maintain a disciplined focus on capital spending 
although these declines reflect significantly lower capital expenditures for network assets that support all services provided by at t  we continue to focus the majority of our capital spending on our data  ip and local voice products 
total assets decreased billion  or  at december   compared with december  the decrease reflects lower receivables primarily driven by the settlement of receivables from concert in connection with the concert unwind  improved cash collections and lower revenue 
the decrease also reflects the write off of the assets associated with the impairment of at t latin america 
at t consumer services at t consumer services provides a variety of communications services to residential customers including domestic and international long distance  transaction based long distance  such as operator assisted service and prepaid phone cards  local and local toll intrastate calls outside the immediate local area  and dial up internet 
for the years ended december  dollars in millions revenue    ebit    capital additions at december  total assets   revenue at t consumer services revenue declined billion  or  in compared with  and billion  or  in compared with the decline in both periods was primarily due to long distance revenue  which fell billion in both and these declines were largely driven by traditional long distance voice services  such as domestic and international dial services long distance calls where the number is dialed before the call  and domestic calling card services 
the traditional long distance voice services revenue was negatively impacted by substitution and the impact of ongoing competition  which has led to a loss of market share 
in addition  the continued migration of customers to optional calling plans and lower priced products  such as prepaid cards  has also negatively impacted revenue 
the revenue decline for also reflects a billion impact due to the elimination of per line charges in july partially offsetting these declines was growth of billion in both and related to local services 
calling volumes declined at a low teen percentage rate in  and a low double digit percentage rate in as a result of competition and wireless and internet substitution  partially offset by an increase in prepaid card usage 
in  approximately of at t consumer services total revenue and more than of prepaid card revenue was related to a contract with wal mart  inc if this contract is not renewed at the next renewal date  january  subject to early termination if certain events occur  at t consumer services revenue would be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in selling the cards through a different channel 
we expect product substitution  competition including the continued entry of the regional bell operating companies rbocs into the long distance market and customer migration to lower priced calling plans and products to continue to negatively impact at t consumer services revenue in ebit ebit declined billion  or  in compared with and declined billion  or  in compared with the declines in both periods were primarily due to the revenue declines in the long distance business 
also impacting the ebit decline in was an asset impairment charge of billion recorded in related to the digital subscriber line dsl assets that will no longer be utilized by at t as a result of the agreement with covad communications to offer dsl services over their network 
ebit margin declined to in from in and in the declining ebit margins primarily reflect the impact of customers who substitute long distance calling with wireless and internet service and remain at t consumer services customers as well as customers who migrate to optional calling plans and lower priced products 
these customers generate less revenue  while their billing  customer care and fixed costs remain 
the margin was also negatively impacted by the dsl asset impairment charge 
the margin decline was also impacted by a slight increase in marketing spending targeted at high value customers  partially offset by the receipt of billion in from the settlement of disputes relating to obligations resulting from the sale of at t universal card services to citigroup in other items in  capital additions decreased million  or  compared with in  capital additions decreased million  or  compared with total assets declined billion to billion at december   compared with billion at december  this decline was primarily due to lower accounts receivable  reflecting lower revenue and slightly improved cash collections 
corporate and other this group primarily reflects the results of corporate staff functions and the elimination of transactions between segments 
for the years ended december  dollars in millions revenue ebit   capital additions  at december  total assets   revenue in  corporate and other revenue was negative million  compared with negative million in the year over year change was primarily due to lower internal revenue with at t wireless due to its split off on july   partially offset by an increase in internal revenue with at t broadband 
in  as a result of the at t broadband spin off  the elimination of internal revenue residing in corporate and other will decline significantly 
revenue for corporate and other was essentially flat in compared with  as lower internal revenue from at t wireless due to its split off in was offset by increased sales from at t business services to at t broadband 
ebit in  ebit improved billion to a deficit of billion 
the improvement was largely due to lower investment impairment charges of approximately billion  primarily related to our investments in netphone and time warner telecom in also contributing to the ebit improvement was lower business restructuring charges as well as lower transaction costs associated with at t s restructuring announced in october of  totaling billion 
these ebit improvements were partially offset by lower net gains of billion driven by a billion tax free gain recorded in associated with the disposal of a portion of at t s retained interest in at t wireless 
also offsetting the ebit improvements were a lower pension credit income of billion primarily driven by a lower long term expected rate of return and the effects of lower actual plan assets  a billion impairment charge recorded in of certain leases of aircraft which are accounted for as leveraged leases  and a billion variance due to mark to market adjustments on derivative instruments 
ebit declined billion to a deficit of billion in compared with the decline was largely due to billion of greater investment impairment charges in  primarily for netphone and time warner telecom 
also contributing to the decline were higher restructuring and other charges and higher transaction costs associated with at t s restructuring announced in october  totaling billion  and a lower pension credit income and higher postretirement expense of billion 
these declines were partially offset by the billion gain associated with the disposal of a portion of at t s retained interest in at t wireless 
other items capital additions decreased million in primarily due to a decline in the purchase of investments 
capital additions decreased billion in primarily as a result of our investment in netphone in total assets decreased billion  to billion in the decrease was primarily driven by a lower cash balance at december   and a decrease in investments primarily due to mark to market adjustments  partially offset by derivative related activity 
financial condition at december  dollars in millions total assets   total liabilities   total shareowners equity   total assets decreased billion  or  to billion at december   compared with december  the november   spin off of at t broadband accounted for billion of the decrease 
the decrease also reflects lower receivables of billion primarily driven by improved cash collections  the settlement of receivables from concert in connection with the concert unwind  and lower revenue 
in addition  assets decreased as a result of a billion reduction in cash and the write off of billion of assets associated with the impairment of our interest in at t latin america 
total liabilities decreased billion  or  to billion at december   from billion at december  the november   spin off of at t broadband contributed billion to the decrease 
also contributing to the decrease in liabilities was billion in lower debt reflecting the pay down of short term debt and at t broadband s assumption of billion of at t long term debt in connection with its spin off 
in addition  total liabilities decreased as a result of the settlement of at t s obligation to purchase the publicly owned shares of at t canada and due to the impairment of our interest in at t latin america 
minority interest of discontinued operations decreased billion at december   compared with december  the decrease was a result of the exchange or redemption of all tci pacific preferred shares for at t common stock and the november   spin off of at t broadband 
quarterly income preferred securities of discontinued operations decreased billion at december   compared with december   as these securities were converted into comcast class a common stock in conjunction with the spin off of at t broadband 
total shareowners equity decreased billion  or  to billion at december   from billion at december  this decrease was primarily due to a decline of billion in additional paid in capital principally due to a billion reduction resulting from the spin off of at t broadband including compensation expense triggered by the spin off  partially offset by an increase of billion from the june common stock offering and billion from the exchange or redemption of all tci pacific preferred shares for at t common shares 
retained earnings decreased billion at december   compared with december   primarily due to the net loss from discontinued operations partially offset by a billion gain on the spin off of at t broadband 
during  when at t declared its quarterly dividends to the at t common stock group shareowners  the company was in an accumulated deficit position 
as a result  the company reduced additional paid in capital by billion  the entire amount of the dividends declared 
liquidity for the years ended december  dollars in millions cash flows provided by operating activities of continuing operations    used in investing activities of continuing operations    used in provided by financing activities of continuing operations    used in provided by discontinued operations    net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents    net cash provided by operating activities of at t s continuing operations of billion for the year ended december   was generated primarily by billion of income from continuing operations  adjusted to exclude noncash income items and net gains on sales of businesses and investments  and a decrease in accounts receivable of billion reflecting cash collections and lower revenue 
partially offsetting these sources of cash were a net change in other operating assets and liabilities of billion due to lower tax liabilities as well as lower payroll and benefit related liabilities 
net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations of billion for the year ended december   primarily included billion of income from continuing operations  adjusted to exclude noncash income items and net gains on sales of businesses and investments  and a decrease in accounts receivable of billion due to lower revenue and strong cash collections in december partially offsetting the cash provided were net changes in other operating assets and liabilities of billion due to tax payments  and a decrease in accounts payable of billion 
net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations of billion for the year ended december   primarily included income from continuing operations  excluding noncash income items and the adjustment for net gains on sales of businesses and investments  of billion  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of billion due to an increase in the receivables from concert and slow customer collections at at t business services  a decrease in accounts payable of billion and a net change in other assets and liabilities of billion 
at t s investing activities resulted in a net use of cash of billion in  compared with billion in and billion in during  at t spent billion on capital expenditures  paid billion to settle the at t canada obligation and received a billion cash distribution from at t broadband in conjunction with its spin off 
in  at t spent billion on capital expenditures  and received approximately billion from the sales of investments 
during  at t used approximately billion for acquisitions of businesses  primarily mediaone group  inc  and spent billion on capital expenditures 
during  net cash used in financing activities was billion  compared with net cash used in financing activities of billion in  and net cash provided by financing activities of billion in during  at t made net payments of billion to reduce debt  paid dividends of billion  and received billion from the issuance of at t common stock  primarily due to the sale of million shares in the second quarter 
the proceeds from this stock sale  along with funds from other short term sources  were used to satisfy at t s obligation to the at t canada shareholders see investing activities above 
during  at t made net debt payments of billion  paid at t wireless billion to settle an intercompany loan in conjunction with its split off from at t  and paid dividends of billion 
partially offsetting these outflows in was the receipt of billion from the issuance of convertible preferred stock to ntt docomo 
during  at t received billion from the at t wireless group tracking stock offering and had net borrowings of debt of billion 
these sources of cash were partially offset by the payment of billion in dividends 
working capital and other sources of liquidity at december   our working capital ratio current assets divided by current liabilities was  reflecting the cash balance on hand as a result of cash received in conjunction with the spin off of at t broadband 
during the second and third quarters of  at t renewed both its at t business services and at t consumer services customer accounts receivable securitization facilities 
together  the programs provide up to billion of available financing  limited by the eligible receivables balance  which varies from month to month 
proceeds from the securitization are recorded as a borrowing and included in short term debt 
at december   approximately billion was outstanding 
the terms of these facilities have been extended to june at t business services and july at t consumer services of at december   we had a billion day credit facility available to us that was entered into on october  the credit facility contains a financial covenant that requires at t to meet a net debt to ebitda ratio as defined in the credit agreement not exceeding to for four consecutive quarters ending on the last day of each fiscal quarter 
it also contains a covenant that requires at t to maintain billion in unencumbered cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
at t reduced its debt in as a result of the spin off of at t broadband on november  the third party debt of tci and mediaone group  inc of billion was included in the net assets spun off with at t broadband 
this debt was included in the liabilities of discontinued operations at december  at the time of spin off  at t and at t broadband settled approximately billion of intercompany debt and transaction related costs 
at t received a billion cash distribution from at t broadband  which is reflected in the cash balance at december  the remainder of the intercompany debt and transaction related costs was settled via a debt exchange 
in the at t broadband debt exchange  billion of outstanding at t notes were exchanged for notes that  upon completion of the spin off of at t broadband  became notes of at t broadband and are unconditionally guaranteed by comcast and certain of its subsidiaries 
in addition  at t completed another exchange in which billion of outstanding at t notes were exchanged for new at t notes that remain solely obligations of at t and  upon completion of the spin off of at t broadband  have revised terms  including revised maturity dates and or interest rates 
we anticipate funding our operations in primarily with cash and cash equivalents on hand as well as cash from operations 
if economic conditions worsen or do not improve and or competition and product substitution accelerate beyond current expectations  our cash flow from operations would decrease  negatively impacting our liquidity 
however  we believe our access to the capital markets is adequate to provide the flexibility in funding our operations that we desire 
sources of liquidity include the commercial paper market  a billion universal shelf registration  the securitization program and the credit facility 
however  we cannot provide any assurances that all of these sources of funding will be available at the time they are needed or in the amounts required 
credit ratings and related debt implications during  at t s long term debt ratings were lowered by moody s and fitch 
none of at t s ratings are currently under review or on credit watch for further downgrade 
as of december   our credit ratings were as follows short term long term credit rating agency rating rating outlook standard poor s a bbb stable moody s p baa negative fitch ratings f bbb stable subsequent to december   the outlook was changed to negative 
our access to the capital markets as well as the cost of our borrowings is affected by our debt ratings 
in  as a result of the moody s downgrade  the interest rate on billion of notes sold in november  increased by basis points effective with interest payment periods that began after november   for the majority of the notes 
the additional interest expense in was approximately million and is estimated to be an additional million in additional debt rating downgrades could require at t to pay higher rates on certain existing debt  prepay certain operating leases and post cash collateral for certain interest rate and equity swaps if we are in a net payable position 
if our ratings were downgraded below investment grade by standard poor s or moody s  there are provisions in our securitization programs  which could require the outstanding balances to be paid by the collection of the receivables 
we do not believe downgrades below investment grade are likely to occur 
the holders of certain private debt with an outstanding balance of billion at december   have an annual put right to cause at t to repay the debt upon payment of an exercise fee 
in exchange for the debt holders agreeing not to exercise their put right  at t posted a cash collateralized letter of credit in totaling billion and expiring march the annual put right for expired on february   without exercise by the debt holders 
the holders could accelerate repayment of the debt based on certain events such as the occurrence of unfavorable local law or regulation changes in its country of operation 
if at t s debt ratings are further downgraded  at t s access to the capital market may be restricted and or such replacement financing may be more costly or have additional covenants than we had in connection with our debt at december  in addition  the market environment for financing in general  and within the telecommunications sector in particular  has been adversely affected by economic conditions and bankruptcies of other telecommunication providers 
if the financial markets become more cautious regarding the industry ratings category we operate in  our ability to obtain financing would be further reduced 
this could negatively impact our ability to pursue acquisitions  make capital expenditures to expand our network or to pay dividends 
cash requirements our cash needs for will be primarily related to capital expenditures  repayment of debt and payment of dividends 
we expect our capital expenditures for to be approximately billion to billion 
on january   we completed the repurchase  with cash  of billion of notes with interest rates of and and maturities of and these notes were classified as long term debt at december  in addition  in connection with the early retirement in february  of exchangeable notes that are indexed to at t wireless stock  we made cash payments of million to the debt holders  funded in part by million of proceeds from the sale of our remaining at t wireless shares 
at t is not required to make cash contributions to its principle pension plans in however  based on the final valuation of private equities and real estate for  cash contributions could be required in contractual cash obligations the following summarizes at t s contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years dollars in millions long term debt  including current maturities       capital lease obligations operating leases  unconditional purchase obligations  total contractual cash obligations      we had long term debt that was indexed to securities monetized debt 
the total balance of monetized debt of million at december   had scheduled maturity dates of and however  in february  we redeemed those notes with a combination of shares and cash of million 
the portion of debt that was settled in shares is excluded from the above table and the cash payments were included in less than year in the above table 
we had long term debt  with original maturity dates of and  with a carrying value of billion at december  this debt was settled in the first quarter of and included in less than year in the above table 
in connection with the settlement of this debt  we paid premiums of million  which are excluded from the above table 
under certain real estate operating leases  we could be required to make payments to the lessors of up to million at the end of the lease term lease terms range from through 
the actual amount paid  if any  would be reduced by amounts received by the lessor upon remarketing of the property 
these amounts are excluded from the above table due to the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be paid  if any  as well as the timing of such amounts 
at t consumer services has unconditional purchase obligations with multiple vendors to purchase a broad range of products and services  including the outsourcing of billing and customer care services  and the purchase of certain promotional items 
such obligations extend through at t has contractual obligations to utilize network facilities from local exchange carriers with terms greater than one year 
since the contracts have no minimum volume requirements  and are based on an interrelationship of volumes and discounted rates  we assessed our minimum commitment based on penalties to exit the contracts  assuming we exited the contracts on december  at december   the penalties at t would have incurred to exit all of these contracts would have been billion 
these amounts are excluded from the above table due to the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be paid  if any  as well as the timing of such amounts 
at t has contractual obligations under two contracts that extend through for services that include computer application design  development  maintenance and testing as well as the operation of data centers that host many of the computer applications operated throughout at t 
payments under these contracts are based in part on the volume and type of services we require 
since at t can terminate either or both of these contracts for convenience at any time by paying a fee  we assessed our minimum commitment based on the termination for convenience fees  which decline each year during the term of the contracts 
if we elect to exit both of these contracts  the maximum termination fees we would be obligated to pay in the year of termination would be approximately million in  million in  million in  or million in these termination fees are excluded from the above table due to the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be paid  if any  as well as the timing of such amounts 
at t has contractual obligations that extend through for services that include payroll and related human resource services 
payments under these contracts are based on level of service required and fluctuates based on volume 
since there is no minimum service requirement and we can exit the contract at any time by paying a termination fee  we assessed our minimum commitment based on these termination fees  assuming we terminated the contracts on december of each year 
such termination fees would be approximately million in  million in  million in  million in  million in or million in these amounts are excluded from the above table due to the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be paid  if any  as well as the timing of such amounts 
from time to time  we guarantee the debt of our subsidiaries  and  in connection with the separation of certain subsidiaries  these guarantees remained and we issued guarantees for certain debt and other obligations 
these guarantees relate to our former subsidiaries at t capital corp  ncr  at t wireless and at t broadband 
we currently hold no collateral for such guarantees  and have not recorded corresponding obligations 
we have been provided with cross guarantees or indemnifications by third parties for certain of these guarantees

under the terms of the merger agreement between at t broadband and comcast  if comcast does not call the debt in  they must provide us with a letter of credit in the amount of million 
in addition  comcast has provided us with an indemnification for this debt 
prior to the spin off of at t broadband  we had guaranteed various obligations of at t broadband  including operating leases for real estate  surety bonds  and equity hedges  which we continue to provide 
comcast has provided indemnifications for the full amount of these guarantees 
at t provides a guarantee of an obligation that at t wireless has to docomo 
in connection with an investment docomo made in at t wireless  at t and at t wireless agreed that under certain circumstances  including that at t wireless fails to meet specific technological milestones by june  revised to december   pursuant to an amended agreement between at t wireless and docomo  docomo would have the right to require at t wireless to repurchase its at t wireless common stock for billion plus interest

at december   our foreign currency market exposures were principally euros  japanese yen  and swiss francs 
the fair value of foreign exchange contracts is subject to the changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for the purpose of assessing specific risks  we use a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair value of our financial instruments and results of operations 
to perform the sensitivity analysis  we assess the risk of loss in fair values from the effect of a hypothetical adverse change in the value of foreign currencies  assuming no change in interest rates 
for foreign exchange contracts outstanding at december  and  assuming a hypothetical appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies from the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates  the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts would have decreased million and million  respectively 
the decrease in the change from l was primarily due to a billion decline in the notional amount of contracts outstanding 
this decline was largely due to debt under the euro commercial paper program paid down in  and the satisfaction of the obligation to purchase the outstanding shares of at t canada in because our foreign exchange contracts are entered into for hedging purposes  we believe that these losses would be largely offset by gains on the underlying transactions 
we have also entered into combined interest rate foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated debt 
at december  and  assuming a hypothetical appreciation in the us dollar against foreign currencies from the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates  the fair value of the combined interest rate foreign currency contracts would have decreased billion and billion  respectively 
because our foreign exchange contracts are entered into for hedging purposes  we believe that these losses would be largely offset by gains on the underlying foreign currency denominated debt 
the model to determine sensitivity assumes a parallel shift in all foreign currency exchange rates  although exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
additionally  the amounts above do not necessarily represent the actual changes in fair value we would incur under normal market conditions because all variables  other than the exchange rates  are held constant in the calculations 
we use interest rate swaps to manage the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
we perform a sensitivity analysis on our interest rate swaps to assess the risk of changes in fair value 
the model to determine sensitivity assumes a hypothetical parallel shift in all interest rates 
at december  and  assuming a hypothetical decrease in interest rates  the fair value of interest rate swaps would have decreased by million and million  respectively 
we believe the decrease in fair value would be largely offset by an increase in the fair value of the underlying hedged debt 
as discussed above  we have also entered into combined interest rate foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated debt 
assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates  the fair value of the contracts would have decreased by million at december   and by a negligible amount at december  the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of the debt due to differences between the market interest rates and rates at the inception of the obligation 
assuming a downward shift in interest rates at december  and  the fair value of unhedged debt would have increased by billion and billion  respectively 
at december   we had certain notes  with embedded derivatives  which were indexed to the market price of equity securities we owned 
changes in the market prices of these securities resulted in changes in the fair value of the derivatives 
assuming a hypothetical increase in the market price of these equity securities  the fair value of the collars would have decreased by million and million at december  and  respectively 
because these collars hedged the underlying equity securities monetized  we believed that the decrease in the fair value of the collars would have been largely offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying equity securities 
the changes in fair values referenced above do not represent the actual changes in fair value we would incur under normal market conditions because all variables other than the equity prices were held constant in the calculations 
we use equity hedges to manage our exposure to changes in equity prices associated with various equity awards of previously affiliated companies 
assuming a hypothetical decrease in equity prices of these companies  the fair value of the equity hedges net liability would have increased by million at december   and by a negligible amount at december  because these contracts are entered into for hedging purposes  we believe that the increase in fair value would be largely offset by decreases in the underlying liabilities 
in order to determine the changes in fair value of our various financial instruments  including options  equity collars and other equity awards  we use certain financial modeling techniques  including black scholes 
we apply rate sensitivity changes directly to our interest rate swap transactions and forward rate sensitivity to our foreign currency forward contracts 
the changes in fair value  as discussed above  assume the occurrence of certain market conditions  which could have an adverse financial impact on the company 
they do not consider the potential effect of changes in market factors that would result in favorable impacts to us  and do not represent projected losses in fair value that we expect to incur 
future impacts would be based on actual developments in global financial markets 
we do not foresee any significant changes in the strategies used to manage interest rate risk  foreign currency rate risk or equity price risk in the near future 
new accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this standard requires that obligations that are legally enforceable and unavoidable  and are associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets  be recorded as liabilities when those obligations are incurred  with the amount of the liability initially measured at fair value 
the offset to the initial asset retirement obligation is an increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  this liability is accreted to its future value  and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  for at t  this means that the standard was adopted on january  at t currently includes  in its group depreciation rates  an amount related to the retirement costs for certain assets 
however  such amounts are not legally enforceable or unavoidable  therefore  at t will be required to reverse the amount accrued in accumulated depreciation 
as of january   at t will report approximately million as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles related to the adoption of sfas no 
the impact of no longer including the cost of removal in the group depreciation rates for these assets  coupled with the cumulative effect impact on accumulated depreciation  will result in a decrease to depreciation expense in however  the costs incurred to remove these assets will be reflected as a cost in the period incurred as costs of services and products 
on june   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses the recognition  measurement and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities 
this statement includes the restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance set forth in eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease and one time benefit arrangements received by employees who are involuntarily terminated nullifying the guidance under eitf under sfas no 
 the cost associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized in the periods in which it is incurred rather than at the date the company committed to the exit plan 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   with earlier application encouraged 
previously issued financial statements will not be restated 
the provisions of eitf shall continue to apply for exit plans initiated prior to the adoption of sfas no 
accordingly  the initial adoption of sfas no 
will not have an effect on at t s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
liabilities associated with future exit and disposal activities will not be recognized until actually incurred 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
this standard provides alternate methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and requires more prominent disclosure about the method used 
this statement is effective for fiscal years ending after december  for at t  this means it is effective for december  currently at t applies the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and we do not expense our stock options 
however  as previously announced  at t will begin expensing all stock options issued after january   and will continue to apply the disclosure only provisions to stock options issued prior to january  this method of transition is in compliance with the provisions of sfas no 
the adoption of the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
will not have an impact on at t s results of operations  financial position or cash flows  however  the expensing of the stock options issued after january   will have a negative impact on our results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the required disclosure under this standard 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that an entity issuing a guarantee including those embedded in a purchase or sales agreement must recognize  at the inception of the guarantee  a liability equal to the fair value of the guarantee 
the recording of this liability is not dependent on the probability that the payments will be required 
the offset to the liability will depend on the circumstances under which the guarantee was issued  but could include cash accounts receivable if it is a standalone transaction  net proceed in a sales transaction  or expense if no compensation is received 
fin also requires detailed information about each guarantee or group of guarantees even if the likelihood of making a payment is remote 
the disclosure requirements of this interpretation are effective for financial statements of periods ending after december   which makes them effective for at t for december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for the disclosures required under this interpretation 
the recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  fin could have an impact on the future results of at t depending on guarantees issued  however  at this time we do not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our results of operation  financial position or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
fin requires the primary beneficiary to consolidate a variable interest entity vie if it has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns if they occur  or both 
fin applies immediately to vies created after january   and to vies in which the entity obtains an interest after that date 
for vies acquired before february   the effective date for at t is july  at t is currently in the process of determining the impact of this statement on its results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the disclosures relating to our present involvement with possible vies and our maximum exposure to losses are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  related to the timing of revenue recognition for arrangements in which goods or services or both are delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement 
the eitf requires that when the deliverables included in this type of arrangement meet certain criteria they should be accounted for separately as separate units of accounting 
this may result in a difference in the timing of revenue recognition but will not result in a change in the total amount of revenue recognized in a bundled sales arrangement 
the allocation of revenue to the separate deliverables is based on the relative fair value of each item 
if the fair value is not available for the delivered items then the residual method must be used 
this method requires that the amount allocated to the undelivered items in the arrangement is their full fair value 
this would result in the discount  if any  being allocated to the delivered items 
this consensus is effective prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   which  for at t  is july  at t is currently evaluating the impact of this consensus on its results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in january  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf  accounting for subsequent investments in an investee after suspension of equity method loss recognition 
this consensus states that if an additional investment  in whole or in part  represents the funding of prior losses  the investor should recognize previously suspended losses 
this determination would be based on various factors including whether the investment results in an increased ownership percentage  the fair value of the consideration received is equivalent to the consideration paid and whether the investment is acquired from a third party or directly from an investee 
if any of these provisions are met  the additional investment would generally not be considered as funding prior losses 
when appropriate to recognize prior losses  the amount recognized would be limited to the amount of the additional investment determined to represent the funding of prior losses 
the consensus will be effective for additional investments made after february  subsequent events in january  at t early retired billion of long term notes 
in february  at t redeemed exchangeable notes that were indexed to at t wireless common stock and subsequently sold its remaining at t wireless holdings
