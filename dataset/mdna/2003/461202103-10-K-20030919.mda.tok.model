com  but we receive revenue from financial institutions and other companies that advertise and or sell their products or services through links from quicken 
com 
global business we have business operations in canada and we also serve markets across europe  southeast asia and other selected locations 
we have established third party relationships with local companies in certain countries to help us better 
table of contents address specific markets 
in all international markets except canada and europe  we focus primarily on small business products 
canada and the united kingdom 
in canada  we offer versions of quickbooks that we have localized  that is  customized to meet the unique needs of customers in that specific international location 
these include right for my business versions of quickbooks targeted at contractors  retail establishments  professional accountants  property managers and nonprofit organizations which we introduced during fiscal  quicktax consumer tax return preparation software  including right for me quicktax products for investors  those who maintain home offices and taxpayers preparing for retirement  which we introduced during fiscal  taxwiz consumer tax return preparation software  which we acquired during fiscal  profile financial application suite professional tax preparation products  and localized versions of quicken

other locations 
we offer localized versions of quickbooks and quicken products in selected european markets through local distributors and agents 
we also offer localized versions of quickbooks and quicken products in australia  new zealand and singapore through a development  marketing and distribution arrangement with australia based reckon limited 
product development historically  our desktop software products have tended to have a fairly predictable  structured development cycle of about a year  with annual product releases 
this trend has been changing 
for our small business desktop products  we now supplement annual releases of our core quickbooks products with periodic releases of quickbooks products for larger or more complex businesses and for our industry specific quickbooks products 
the development timing for our service offerings  such as outsourced payroll  is determined by business needs and regulatory requirements and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each particular project 
developing tax preparation software presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate annual tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable 
the product development cycles for our vertical business management solutions businesses are sometimes longer than one year for major product releases 
for a description of other risks and challenges we face relating to our product development  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks that could affect future results 
during the past few years  we have devoted significant resources to developing new products and services  including quickbooks premier  quickbooks premier accountant edition  quickbooks enterprise solutions business management software  industry specific versions of quickbooks  the intuit developer network  turbotax premier  the instant data entry feature of our turbotax products and services and quicken premier 
we supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring strategically important products and technology from third parties  or establishing other relationships that enable us to expand our offerings more rapidly 
for example  during fiscal we acquired four companies that provide business management products in selected vertical industries  and we worked closely with a third party technology provider to develop our quickbooks point of sale software 
in fiscal we acquired the technology assets underlying this software from the same provider 
in fiscal we also acquired blue ocean software  a company with a product that helps businesses manage their information technology resources and assets  and we formed a strategic alliance with a third party database company that allows us to use their data management and synchronization package in our future research and development 
we also devote resources to improving our existing products and services 
for our desktop software products  our recent development efforts have focused on creating an easier  more seamless end to end customer experience  as well as adding new features 
for example  in fiscal our turbotax product development team invested significant resources in improving areas of the product that customers told us weren t easy to use or resulted in customer support contacts 
we also continue to incorporate technology in our products and services to address customer concerns about privacy and security while minimizing the impact on performance and ease of use 
in addition  in recent years we have developed technology that helps reduce unlicensed use of some of our desktop software products 
our quickbooks products require registration after an initial trial period  and our professional tax return preparation products and our canadian consumer tax products contain technology that restricts sharing of 
table of contents those products 
we have also developed technology to unlock marketing and trial versions of many of our us products  such as turbotax mycd 
during the past few years  we have made a number of improvements to our product development process 
we team technical support and product development personnel so that we can anticipate feature usability and support issues early in the development process 
in fiscal  the quickbooks product development team deployed a rigorous process to build customer requirements into the development and beta processes 
quickbooks continued to evolve during the year through a regular update and release cycle that further integrated customer suggestions 
this iterative process improved product quality and reduced customer service and technical support call volume for our quickbooks products 
other significant product development process improvements include the adoption of formal software inspections in several of our large development groups  the introduction of an enhanced software change management process to the tax software product development organizations and the institutionalization of software architecture as a discipline in all major software development groups 
these changes and others  such as automating our quality assurance testing and providing electronic updates to our beta test customers  have allowed us to shorten our development cycles and launch more new products more quickly 
our research and development expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal over the next few years  we expect that we will be faced with somewhat different product development challenges than we have in the past 
we will be developing more versions of more complex products than ever before 
in addition  these products will offer increased ease of use  be customized for specific customer needs and feature improved integration with other intuit products and services and with our internal information support systems 
our research and development efforts will be focused on developing new products and services to address customer needs in our more broadly defined market segments as well as adding complementary products and services to drive additional  recurring revenue from our core products 
we strive to maintain a balance between relatively low risk investments that address existing customer needs and investments in more innovative but higher risk projects with potentially greater returns 
marketing  sales and distribution markets during the past two years  we have expanded both the markets that we serve and the products and services that we offer in our target markets 
historically  our target markets were individuals and small businesses with less than employees 
we continue to serve those markets with products and services such as quickbooks  turbotax and quicken 
in addition to these markets  we are now targeting small businesses with up to employees 
we are addressing this new customer segment with a number of new products and services under the umbrella of our right for my business strategy 
we are introducing accounting solutions to meet the specialized requirements of certain small businesses by developing industry specific versions of quickbooks  which we call flavors 
we have introduced new premier and enterprise versions of quickbooks for companies that  due to their larger size or complexity  have more demanding accounting needs 
we have also introduced business solutions that go beyond accounting software to address a wider range of business management challenges that small businesses face 
in addition  we have acquired companies that offer robust business management solutions to a wide range of businesses in selected industries  which we call verticals 
we expect to continue expanding in these directions over the next several years 
see business overview customer focused product strategy and products and services  above  for more details about our product and service offerings 
many of the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing customer demands  continuous technological changes and improvements  shifting industry standards and frequent new product introductions by competitors 
market and industry changes can quickly render existing products and services obsolete  so our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new business models  updated competitive strategies  new or enhanced products and services  alternative distribution methods and other changes to the way we do business 
for a description of other risks and challenges we face relating to marketing  sales and distribution  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks that could affect future results 

table of contents distribution channels over the past two years we have been broadening our distribution channels to accommodate the recent expansion of the markets we serve and the range of products and services we offer 
our goal is to make our products and services available in a variety of ways so that each customer may choose the channel that best meets that customer s needs 
direct marketing programs 
for our core desktop software products quickbooks  turbotax and quicken  we use various types of direct marketing campaigns including mail  email and telephone solicitations  direct response newspaper and magazine advertising  and television and radio advertising to generate software orders  stimulate demand and generally maintain and increase consumer awareness of our products 
we also use workflow integrated in product messaging in several of our software products to market our other related products and services 
in addition  we have recently initiated new direct marketing programs in which we ship certain software products directly to customers without charge 
customers electronically unlock and pay for the products when they are ready to use them 
direct marketing campaigns are one of the most effective ways to encourage existing customers to purchase additional products and services  including software upgrades 
direct sales channel 
our direct sales efforts have historically focused on generating sales of relatively inexpensive  off the shelf products to existing customers through call centers 
our service offerings  such as intuit payroll services complete payroll  as well as our more sophisticated  higher priced software products  require a different approach to direct sales than our traditional desktop software 
as we have expanded our service offerings and introduced more high end software products and business management solutions over the past two years  we have been enhancing our direct sales capabilities to support revenue growth in these new areas  as well as in our core desktop software 
we are investing in technology to consolidate and improve our management of customer contact data and order management tools across business divisions and we are training our customer service personnel in consultative selling techniques 
we have expanded our direct sales staff and broadened its role to include more extensive and personalized contact with existing and potential customers 
in addition  the products and services we offer through our vertical business management solutions segment are sold primarily through direct sales organizations 
as a result of all of these factors  we expect that direct sales will become an increasingly important source of revenue and will increase our selling and marketing expenses over the next few years 
many of our direct customers choose to order and or take delivery of products electronically through our web sites 
electronic ordering and delivery are generally more convenient for customers and more cost efficient for intuit 
electronic delivery is available for most of our tax preparation products and for all product updates for our tax preparation products 
retail distribution channel 
we market our quickbooks  turbotax and quicken desktop software at retail in north america primarily through traditional retail software outlets  computer superstores  office supply superstores  food and drug retailers  warehouse clubs and general mass merchandisers 
in international markets  we also rely on distributors  value added resellers and other third parties  who sell products into the retail channel 
we will continue to evaluate new retail distribution channels as appropriate for reaching our customers in the future 
we continue to benefit from strong relationships with a number of major north american retailers  which allows us to minimize our dependence on any specific retailer 
we now ship most of our products directly to the individual store locations of these major retailers and use distributors only to reach smaller retailers 
see manufacturing and distribution 
we continue to aggressively manage our inventory to optimize in stock presence and ensure good product placement within retail stores 
in response to current retail trends  we are also placing a greater proportion of inventory with retailers on a consignment basis 
see competition and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks that could affect future results 
as we execute on our right for my business strategy  we are starting to offer software products that are more complex and have higher prices than our traditional retail software products 
our recent tailoring of some of these software products to specific customer needs  including industry specific versions of quickbooks  is also resulting in a greater number of intuit products 
we produce and place in store displays and other retail merchandising aids 
table of contents that educate customers about product functionality and benefits 
however  we continue to evaluate whether the retail channel will be an effective distribution model for some of these higher end offerings 
see competition and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks that could affect future results 
oem channel 
we have existing relationships with a number of personal computer original equipment manufacturers  or oems  including apple computer inc  dell computer corporation  gateway inc 
and hewlett packard  which enable us to generate sales of our core desktop software products in two ways 
first  certain oems pre bundle new user versions of certain desktop software products on the computer systems that the oems sell to their customers 
these pre bundled oem sales are a good source of new customers and future revenues 
the second source of revenue from the oem channel is after market programs  in which customers who are purchasing computers can select and purchase software products at the same time 
third party value added distribution arrangements 
as we execute on our right for my business strategy  we are supplementing our direct sales capabilities and our retail and oem distribution relationships with selected third party distribution arrangements 
we believe these relationships will enhance the growth opportunities for our higher end product and service offerings by allowing us to benefit from the value added marketing and sales expertise of these third parties 
we currently have arrangements with third parties who have specialized expertise in marketing  selling and providing post sale implementation services for some of our vertical business management solutions businesses 
during fiscal and beyond  we expect to continue to optimize and support our network of third party relationships to help increase revenue for some of our existing higher end products and services  as well as for additional products and services we anticipate offering as we execute our right for my business strategy 
competition overview we face intense competition in almost all of our businesses  both domestically and globally 
competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve  particularly small business and consumer tax  has grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue 
some of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
as we implement our customer focused strategies  we face increased competitive threats from larger companies in more diverse markets than we have historically faced 
in addition  the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter markets in which we compete 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks that could affect future results 
for our quickbooks  turbotax and quicken desktop software  we believe the most important competitive factors are product features  ease of use  size of the installed customer base  brand name recognition  price  product and support quality and access to distribution channels 
we believe we compete effectively on these factors as our three principal desktop software products are the leading products in the retail sales channel for their respective categories 
for most of our products and services other than desktop software  we believe the most important competitive factors are features and ease of use  brand name recognition  speed in getting new products and services to market  the ability to distribute them effectively through online methods or through retailers  third party resellers and direct distribution and quality of implementation and support 
for our service offerings such as outsourced payroll  service reliability and scalability of operations are also important factors 
we believe we compete effectively on these factors 
our most obvious competition comes from other companies that offer technology solutions similar to ours 
these competitors are described below 
however  for many of our products and services  other important competitive alternatives for customers are manual tools and processes  or general purpose software 
many of our new customers have used pencil and paper or software such as word processors and spreadsheets  rather than competitors software and services  to perform financial tasks 
for example  many taxpayers prepared their tax returns manually before using turbotax  a large number of small businesses used spreadsheets to keep their books and they processed their payroll using spreadsheets and manually written checks before purchasing quickbooks  and most of our personal finance customers tracked their finances with spreadsheets  manually or not at all before using quicken 

table of contents quickbooks and small business products and services competitors for our small business accounting and business management offerings include companies such as best peachtree software which is owned by the sage group plc  microsoft corporation  and myob group 
microsoft has several small business offerings that compete with our small business offerings  including microsoft business solutions small business manager  microsoft busines solutions crm and business contact manager for microsoft office outlook we expect that microsoft small business offerings will continue to compete with our small business offerings  perhaps even more directly in the future 
as we expand the depth and breadth of our small business offerings  we face competition from companies that are already offering industry specific small business solutions and business management tools and services for larger small businesses 
in addition to established competitors  other potential competitors have expressed significant interest in providing accounting and other products and services to small businesses 
our payroll services compete directly with traditional payroll service providers as well as web based service providers 
significant competitive factors include distribution channels and a highly fragmented market  including financial institutions that are developing or promoting their own payroll services 
we face direct competition in our intuit payroll services complete payroll business from traditional payroll services offered by a number of companies  including adp and paychex  as well as hundreds of regional and local companies 
our quickbooks assisted payroll service competes directly with companies offering web based payroll services  and indirectly with companies offering other payroll solutions 
various companies also offer tax table subscription and electronic filing services similar to our quickbooks do it yourself payroll offering 
our financial supplies business competes with a number of business forms companies  including new england business service and deluxe business systems  as well as with printing services offered by franchises such as kinko s and large office supply retailers such as office depot and staples 
other competitors include direct mail check printers  banks and a number of smaller scale internet based printing companies 
in addition  our quickbooks products include some features such as customizable invoicing and tax form printing that compete with our supplies products 
online bill payment services and online payroll services with direct deposit capabilities also offer competitive alternatives to printed checks 
significant competitive factors for the supplies business include ordering convenience  methods of reaching customers  product quality  speed of delivery and price 
we believe that our convenient access to our large quickbooks and quicken customer bases is a significant competitive advantage for our financial supplies business 
consumer tax competition in the consumer tax preparation market is intense 
our major domestic competitor for both desktop and web based consumer tax software continues to be h r block  the makers of taxcut software 
in addition  a number of smaller competitors have entered the online consumer tax preparation market segment  and other larger competitors may enter both the desktop and web based consumer tax market segments in the future 
our consumer tax products and services also compete for customers with professional tax preparers  particularly those with franchise operations and including those who use our professional tax return preparation software 
we also face potential competitive challenges from publicly funded government entities that offer electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to individual taxpayers 
the federal government signed a three year agreement with the free file alliance in october under which a number of private sector companies  rather than the federal government  are providing web based federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost through voluntary public service initiatives such as our intuit tax freedom project 
as a member of the free file alliance  we continue to actively work with others in the public sector to advance the goals of the free file alliance program and to support a successful public private partnership 
however  future administrative  regulatory or legislative activity in this area could adversely affect us

professional accounting solutions the professional accounting solutions and tax preparation software market segment has many competitors 
our largest competitors in the united states are cch incorporated  with its prosystem fx product line  kleinrock 
table of contents publishing  with its atx product line  and the thomson corporation  with its creative solutions and gosystem offerings 
we also have many smaller competitors in this market segment 
the professional tax market has been highly fragmented in the past  but it has experienced some consolidation in recent years 
vertical business management solutions all of our vertical business management solutions businesses operate in highly competitive and fragmented environments where no competitor has a significant share of the market segment 
we may experience pricing pressure in these market segments because we compete with many small companies  who have fewer resources than larger companies and are therefore more likely to focus on near term sales 
in each of these market segments  the possibility exists that through either consolidation within the market segment or the entry into the market segment of new companies a significant competitor will emerge 
other businesses in desktop personal finance software  the microsoft money product is our primary domestic competition 
we also face competition from web based personal finance tracking and management tools that are available at no cost to consumers through financial institutions and others 
there are many competitors for our other personal finance products and services 
some portal web sites and financial institutions also provide offerings such as web based bill presentment and payment services that compete with services we offer 
in canada  we face competition from a number of companies in the small business arena  including computer associates international  inc and microsoft corporation 
competitors for our canadian consumer tax business include online consumer tax products from a number of companies including ufile as well as tax preparation services from companies such as h r block and liberty tax 
the primary competitor for our professional tax business in canada is cch canadian limited 
in europe  we face competition from bhuldata wiso  microsoft and the sage group plc based in the united kingdom in the small business market  as well as competition from various web based accounting products 
our primary global competitor in the personal finance arena is microsoft 
customer service and technical support we provide customer service and technical support by telephone  online chat  fax  e mail and our customer service and technical support web sites 
we have full time and outsourced customer service and technical support staffs  which we supplement with seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes  such as during the tax return filing season or following a major product launch 
during the past few years  we have focused on developing support capabilities that can supplement  or in some situations replace  telephone service and support 
for example  customers can use our web sites to find answers to commonly asked questions  check on the status of product orders and receive product updates electronically 
alternative service and support methods are less expensive for us and are often more efficient and effective for our customers 
we have completed a number of process excellence projects in our customer service and technical support operations to improve our call capacity forecasting  develop more flexible approaches to staffing and reduce support call volumes and handling times 
we have also outsourced a portion of the growth in our customer service and technical support operations to several firms located in the united states as well as to firms located outside the united states  including india and northern ireland 
we expect to continue to outsource a portion of those operations in the future 
we believe that both these process improvement and outsourcing projects are critical to our ongoing efforts to provide better service to customers at the same or lower cost 
we generally charge customers for technical support  but we do not charge for installation problems or product defect issues 
we offer free self help information through our technical support web sites for our main product lines 
support alternatives and fees vary widely by product  from self help to online chat to telephone support 
our customers can generally choose from a range of support options that are priced based on the level of personal assistance and response time they require 
our vertical business management solutions businesses also offer product consulting and training services 

table of contents despite our efforts to maintain continuous and reliable customer service and technical support operations  we risk losing service at any one of our customer contact centers and our redundancy systems could prove inadequate to provide backup support

manufacturing and distribution desktop software the major steps involved in manufacturing desktop software are duplicating cds  printing boxes and related materials  and assembling and shipping the final products 
we have a manufacturing agreement with modus media international  inc under which modus provides substantially all outsourced manufacturing related to our retail launches of quickbooks  turbotax and quicken  as well as for day to day retail order fulfillment after product launches 
although modus has operations in multiple locations that can provide redundancy if necessary  we are in the process of centralizing the manufacturing for our retail products in one of their facilities which is co located with our primary retail fulfillment vendor  ingram micro logistics 
we expect this arrangement to result in lower manufacturing costs and shorter manufacturing cycle times 
during fiscal  we also had an in house facility that handled the manufacturing and shipping for most direct sales orders 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we signed an agreement with arvato services  inc  a subsidiary of bertelsmann  to outsource our direct product manufacturing and distribution 
we expect this arrangement to result in expanded capabilities  service improvements and lower manufacturing and distribution costs 
we anticipate that the transition to arvato will be complete by the end of october we have multiple sources for all of our raw materials and availability has historically not been a problem for us 
over the past few years  we have taken steps to streamline our packaging and reduce our inventory and scrap costs in order to generate greater profitability in our core desktop software businesses 
our retail product launches have become operationally more complex over the past few years 
we have evolved from shipping to a few hundred distribution centers with distributors delivering products to individual retail locations to a direct to storefront model in which we ship products directly to approximately  individual retail locations 
this allows us to be more responsive to the needs of our retail accounts 
we have an agreement with ingram micro logistics under which ingram handles all logistics  fulfillment and similar functions for our retail sales in support of this direct to storefront initiative 
during the past two years we have improved operational rigor at various points in our supply chain 
as a result  we have significantly increased our on time shipments and significantly reduced our aggregate channel inventory levels 
we have also reduced our dependence on distributors or on any individual retail account 
no distributor or retailer accounted for or more of our total net revenue during fiscal  or prior to major product releases  we tend to have significant levels of backlog  but at other times backlog is minimal and we normally ship products within a few days of receiving an order 
because of this fluctuation in backlog  we believe that backlog is not a reliable predictor of our future desktop software sales 
internet based products and services intuit s data centers house most of the systems  networks and databases required to operate and deliver our internet based products and services  including quickbooks online edition  quickbooks assisted payroll service  turbotax for the web  electronic tax filing and quicken 
com 
through our data centers  we connect customers to products and services  and we store the vast amount of data that represents the content on our web sites 
our data centers consist of approximately  servers and databases located in several sites across the united states 
in an effort to reduce unavailability  or down time  for our internet based products and services  we generally follow industry standard practices for creating a fault tolerant environment  but we do not have complete redundancy 
we also have a major initiative underway to provide back up processing capabilities that are designed to protect us 
table of contents against site related disasters 
despite our efforts to maintain continuous and reliable server operations  we occasionally experience unplanned outages or technical difficulties

privacy and security of customer information customers are concerned about the privacy and security of the personal information they provide to companies 
this concern applies to information they provide in connection with internet based products and services  as well as information they provide through more traditional methods  such as product registration cards 
in addition to customer concerns  we are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy and security 
we are also subject to laws and regulations that apply to telemarketing activities 
additional laws in both areas are likely to be passed in the future  which could result in significant limitations on the ways in which we can communicate with our customers and significantly increase our compliance costs 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks that could affect future results 
we have established guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers are aware of  and can control  how we use information about them 
all publicly accessible  intuit owned and operated consumer web sites at which customer data is collected including quickbooks 
com  turbotax 
com and quicken 
com have been certified by truste  an independent  non profit privacy organization that operates a web site certification program to alleviate users concerns about online privacy 
each of our web sites  as well as our software products  has a privacy statement providing notice to customers of our privacy practices  as well as providing them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their data 
to address security concerns  we use industry standard security safeguards to help protect the information customers give to us from loss  misuse and unauthorized alteration 
whenever customers transmit sensitive information  such as a credit card number or tax return data  to us through our web site  we provide them access to our servers that allow encryption of the information as it is transmitted to us 
we work to protect personally identifiable information stored on the web site s servers from unauthorized access using commercially available computer security products  such as firewalls  as well as internally developed security procedures and practices 
we believe privacy and security issues pose a significant risk to intuit and other companies  especially companies doing business over the internet 
although we have made significant efforts to address customer concerns through our business practices  during the past few years we have faced lawsuits and negative publicity relating to privacy issues 
our response to these allegations has been that we do not share any personally identifiable information except as disclosed in our privacy policies 
a major breach of customer privacy or security  even by another company  could have serious consequences for our businesses

government regulation we offer certain products and services  such as our payroll offerings  which are subject to special regulatory requirements 
as we expand our small business offerings  we may become subject to additional government regulation  particularly in the areas of retirement planning and other employer services 
we continually analyze new business opportunities  and new businesses that we pursue may require additional costs for regulatory compliance 
current government regulation poses a number of risks to us  including potential liability to customers and or penalties and sanctions by government regulators 
future regulation could hamper the growth of our businesses

table of contents intellectual property we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws  and employee and third party nondisclosure and license agreements to protect our software products and other proprietary technology 
we do not own all of the software and other technologies used in our products and services  but we have the licenses from third parties that we believe are necessary and appropriate for using that technology in our current products 
we consider our principal trademarks including intuit  quickbooks  turbotax and quicken to be important assets and have registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the united states and many foreign countries 
the initial duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country and is years in the united states 
most registrations can be renewed perpetually at year intervals 
we face a number of risks relating to our intellectual property  including persistent piracy of our desktop software products through unauthorized use and copying 
although we continue to evaluate technology solutions to piracy  as well as increase our civil and criminal enforcements efforts  we expect piracy to be a persistent problem 
we also face the risk of third parties claiming that our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights  and we face risks to the value of our brands when we grant trademark licenses to third parties

employees as of august   we had approximately  employees located primarily in the united states  canada and the united kingdom 
we believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business 
we do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with our employees  and we believe employee relations are generally good 
although we have employment related agreements with a number of key employees  these agreements do not guarantee continued service 
we believe we offer competitive compensation and a good working environment 
we were selected as one of fortune magazine s best companies to work for in april and however  we face intense competition for qualified employees  and we expect to face continuing challenges in recruiting and retention

overview intuit s mission 
our mission is to transform the way people run their businesses and manage their financial lives 
our products and services fall into the following principal categories quickbooks small business accounting and business management solutions  small business products and services that include payroll  financial supplies  technical support and information technology management solutions  turbotax consumer tax products and services  proseries and lacerte professional tax products and services  intuit branded business management solutions designed to meet the specialized requirements of businesses in selected industries which we call verticals  and our other businesses  which consist primarily of quicken personal finance products and services and our canadian business 
see net revenue below and note of the financial statements for more information about our business segments 
expanding product and service offerings 
during the last year  we have expanded the number and complexity of the products and services that we offer 
under our right for my business strategy  we are introducing solutions to meet the specialized requirements of certain small businesses by developing industry specific versions of quickbooks  which we call flavors 
we have introduced new versions of quickbooks for companies that  due to their larger size or complexity  have more demanding accounting needs 
we have also introduced business solutions that go beyond accounting software to address a wider range of business management challenges that small businesses face 
in addition  we are acquiring companies that offer robust business management solutions to businesses in selected vertical industries 
we expect to continue to expand in these directions over the next several years 
evolving distribution channels 
we have been expanding our distribution channels to accommodate the expansion of the markets we serve and the range of products and services we offer our target customers 
in the retail channel  we are selling an increasing proportion of our software products directly to a variety of retailers rather than through a few major distributors 
as we offer software products that are more complex and higher priced than our traditional retail software products  we expect that direct sales will become an increasingly important source of revenue and new customers 
finally  as we add products and services that are complementary to our core products  we are focusing on strengthening our cross selling capabilities 
we expect that these increased capabilities will allow us to generate additional revenue from our existing customers  particularly our small business customers 

table of contents seasonality 
our tax businesses  and to a lesser extent our small business products and services  are highly seasonal 
sales of tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april 
these seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second and third quarters ending january and april since fiscal  we have recognized an increasing portion of our consumer tax annual revenue during the third quarter compared to the second quarter  and that trend continued during fiscal we typically report losses in our first and fourth quarters ending october and july when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal  while operating expenses to develop new products and services continue at relatively consistent levels 
impact of acquisitions 
our acquisitions of businesses and assets have affected the comparability of our results 
during the past three fiscal years  we have completed several acquisitions  which have affected the comparability of revenue and operating results for those years 
the amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets we have acquired in connection with acquisitions has also had a significant impact on our operating results  and on the comparability of results for those years 
during fiscal and  we recorded amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets and other acquisition related charges of million and million  which included impairment charges of million and million 
starting with the first quarter of fiscal  we no longer amortize goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result  our acquisition related charges decreased significantly during fiscal  to million 
there were no impairment charges in fiscal it is possible that in the future we may incur impairment charges related to existing goodwill  as well as to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions 
at july   we had million in goodwill and million in intangible assets on our balance sheet 
see notes and of the financial statements for more information regarding our goodwill and intangible assets and the impact of impairment charges on our reported net income or loss 
critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue  operating income or loss and net income or loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this report with the audit committee of our board of directors 
net revenue revenue recognition 
intuit derives revenues from the sale of packaged software products  product support  professional services  outsourced payroll services and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items 
we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue 
see note of the financial statements  net revenue 
we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
however  determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for example  for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver  to determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  to determine whether vendor specific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
amounts invoiced relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized as the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
net revenue return and rebate reserves 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we estimate future product returns and rebate payments and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates 
our return policy allows distributors and retailers  subject to certain contractual limitations  to return purchased products 
for product returns reserves  we consider such factors as the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel  historical return rates for prior releases of the 
table of contents product  trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products 
we fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels 
our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and end user rebates 
our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors and retailers actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs  which we typically establish annually 
our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program  actual sales during the promotion  the amount of redemptions received and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program 
in the past  actual returns and rebates have approximated and not generally exceeded the reserves that we have established 
however  actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently uncertain 
if we were to change our assumptions and estimates  our revenue reserves would change  which would impact the net revenue we report 
if actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have established  the actual results would decrease our future reported revenue 
conversely  if actual returns and rebates are significantly less than our reserves  this would increase our future reported revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
the accounts receivable amount on our balance sheet includes a reserve for accounts that might not be paid 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical level of credit losses 
we also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses 
however  since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate 
if actual credit losses are significantly greater than the reserve we have established  that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income 
conversely  if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve  this would eventually decrease our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net income 
goodwill  purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets impairment assessments 
we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
we test the impairment of goodwill annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise 
in order to estimate the fair value of long lived assets  we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to  consider market factors specific to that business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
more conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in impairment charges  which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 
conversely  less conservative assumptions could result in smaller or no impairment charges  higher net income and higher asset values 
at july   we had million in goodwill and million in intangible assets on our balance sheet 
accounting for stock based incentive programs 
we currently measure compensation expense for our stock based incentive programs using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under this method  we do not record compensation expense when stock options are granted to eligible participants as long as the exercise price is not less than the fair market value of the stock when the option is granted 
we also do not record compensation expense in connection with our employee stock purchase plan as long as the purchase price of the stock is not less than of the lower of the fair market value of the stock at the 
table of contents beginning of each offering period or at the end of each purchase period 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we disclose our pro forma net income or loss and net income or loss per share as if the fair value based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense for our stock based incentive programs 
we have elected to follow apb because  as discussed in note of the financial statements  the fair value accounting provided for under sfas requires the use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the financial accounting standards board fasb decided on april  to require all companies to expense the value of incentive stock options 
companies will be required to measure the cost of incentive stock options according to their fair value 
the fasb has indicated that it plans to issue in the near future an exposure draft of a new accounting standard addressing this matter 
this new accounting standard could become effective as early as prior to issuance of this exposure draft  the fasb has indicated that it will be addressing several significant technical issues 
a method to determine the fair value of incentive stock options must be established 
current accounting standards require the use of an option pricing model  such as the black scholes model  to determine fair value and provide guidance on adjusting some of the input factors used in the model 
this valuation approach has received significant criticism and may be subject to changes that could have a significant impact on the calculated fair value of incentive stock options under the new standard 
among other things  the fasb must also determine the extent to which the new accounting standard will permit adjustments to recognized expense for actual option forfeitures and actual performance outcomes 
this determination will affect the timing and amount of compensation expense recognized 
we monitor progress at the fasb and other developments with respect to the general issue of stock based incentive compensation 
in the future  should we expense the value of stock based incentive compensation  either out of choice or due to new requirements issued by the fasb  and or decide to alter our current employee compensation programs to provide other benefits in place of incentive stock options  we may have to recognize substantially more compensation expense in future periods that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
income taxes estimates of effective tax rates  deferred taxes and valuation allowance 
when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we show on our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
to the extent we believe that realization is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period  we record a corresponding tax expense on our statement of operations 
management must make significant judgments to determine our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
our net deferred tax asset as of july  was million  net of the valuation allowance of million 
we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets consisting primarily of certain net operating losses carried forward by our international subsidiaries and certain state capital loss carryforwards before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable 
while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  we could be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize 
an increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact  which could be material  on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we make the increase

the volume increase was driven by strong upgrade sales  which we believe were due in part to our decision to discontinue technical support and tax table services during calendar for customers using certain older versions of quickbooks 
we believe that the availability of a range of third party offerings from the intuit developer network to quickbooks customers may also have contributed to the stronger upgrade sales

fiscal compared to fiscal cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this was primarily due to strong sales of our new higher priced quickbooks products  which have higher margins per unit 
we also continued to improve the packaging design process for certain products and streamline some of our manufacturing processes during fiscal this enabled us to reduce the per unit materials  manufacturing and shipping costs for our shrink wrap software products 
we expect to implement further efficiencies in our manufacturing processes during fiscal we also expect that the mix shift toward our higher priced  higher margin quickbooks products will continue and that growth rates for our higher priced quickbooks products will exceed those for our lower priced products 
cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to the growth in our outsourced payroll business during fiscal as this business grows  we are leveraging our historical investments in data center and other infrastructure to reduce the unit cost and improve the profitability of outsourced payroll services 
in addition  starting in the third quarter of fiscal we no longer paid royalties to wells fargo bank for our premier payroll service 
although we now amortize the million purchase price of the right to market to this customer base to cost of service revenue  the amortization expense is less than the royalties that would have been incurred under the old agreement

recent accounting pronouncements in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
issue provides guidance on accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of issue will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not believe that the adoption of issue will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires us to consolidate a variable interest entity if we are subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
a variable interest entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in research and development or other activities on behalf of another company 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  some of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
we anticipate that the adoption of fin will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

table of contents risks that could affect future results company wide factors that could affect future results we face intense competitive pressures in all of our businesses  which can have a negative impact on our revenue  profitability and market position 
we have formidable current and potential competitors 
accordingly  we expect competition to remain intense during fiscal and beyond 
in all our businesses  we face continual risks that competitors will introduce better products and services  reduce prices  gain better access to distribution channels  increase advertising including advertising targeted at intuit customers  and release new products and services before we do 
any of these competitive actions particularly any prolonged price competition could result in lower net revenue and or lower profitability for us 
they could also affect our ability to keep existing customers and acquire new customers 
for more information about the competitive environment in which we operate  see item  business competition and the competition risk factors for each of our businesses below 
if we do not continue to develop new products and services in a timely manner  our future financial results will suffer 
it is necessary for us to continually develop new products and services and to improve existing products and services so that we can remain competitive in the markets we serve and in the markets we seek to enter 
in executing our customer focused product strategies  we have introduced a number of products and services that are specially designed for specific businesses and consumer needs 
many of our offerings have posed new product development challenges for us because several of these offerings require that our products and services integrate with one another and with both our web sites and our internal information systems 
in addition  our customers expect and our business model contemplates increased functionality and greater inter operability among our products and services 
moreover  our development and enhancement processes involve several risks  including challenges in hiring and retaining highly qualified employees  the risk of delays in product and service launches  the risk of defects that hinder performance and the risk that consumers will not buy new or modified offerings 
failure to timely and successfully develop new products and services would harm our competitive position and result in declines in our revenue and earnings 
expanding our product and service offerings creates risks due to the increasing complexity and decreasing predictability of our revenue streams 
our expanding range of products and services generates more varied revenue streams than our traditional desktop software businesses 
the accounting policies that apply to these revenue streams are more complex than those that apply to our traditional products and services 
we expect this trend to continue as we acquire additional companies 
for example  as we begin to offer additional features and options as part of multiple element sales arrangements  we could be required to defer a higher percentage of our product revenue at the time of sale than we do for traditional products 
this would decrease revenue at the time products are shipped  but result in increased revenue in fiscal periods after shipment 
in addition  our vertical business management solutions businesses offer products and services with significantly higher prices than we have traditionally offered 
revenue from these offerings tends to be less predictable than revenue from our traditional desktop products  due to longer sales and implementation cycles 
these businesses also tend to rely on a relatively small number of large orders for a substantial portion of their revenue in a particular quarter  which could cause our quarterly revenue from these businesses to fluctuate 
we are continuing to implement new information systems to enable us to execute on our growth strategy  and problems with the design or implementation of these new systems could interfere with our business and operations 
we are in the process of implementing new information systems to eventually replace our existing systems 
as a part of this effort  we began implementing in fiscal  and will continue to implement in fiscal  new software applications to manage our business and finance operations 
we may not successfully implement these new systems and transition data  and even if we do succeed  the implementation may be much more costly than we anticipated 
any disruptions relating to these systems enhancements could adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely and accurate manner take customer orders  ship products  provide services and support to our customers  bill and track our customers  fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our business 
in addition  many of our newer businesses depend on a different operational infrastructure than our desktop software businesses  and we must continually develop  expand and modify our internal systems and procedures including call center  customer management  order management  billing and other systems to support these businesses 
if we are unable to successfully implement new information systems  our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and stock price could be adversely affected 

table of contents any significant failure in our technology systems could harm our operations and our financial performance 
we rely on a variety of technology systems to  among other functions  take and fulfill customer orders  handle customer service requests  host our web based activities  support internal operations and store customer and company data 
our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted  or lose customer data  any of which could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and adversely impact our internal operations 
to prevent interruptions  we must continually upgrade our systems and processes to ensure that we have adequate recoverability both of which are costly and time consuming 
while we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations  our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities 
in addition  we may have inadequate insurance coverage or insurance limits to compensate us for losses from a major interruption 
if any of this were to occur  it could harm our financial performance  damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy 
business integration of acquired companies presents several challenges and we may not fully realize the intended benefits of our acquisitions if we do not successfully integrate them with our operations 
during the past few years  we have completed numerous acquisitions two in fiscal and five in fiscal  and we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions as part of our right for my business strategy 
these acquisitions expand our product and service offerings  personnel and geographic locations and require us to integrate different company cultures  management teams and business infrastructures 
the integration process can strain our resources and be expensive and time consuming  particularly if we are integrating multiple companies at the same time 
promptly and efficiently integrating acquired businesses creates challenges for our operational  financial and management information systems  as well as for our product development processes 
we may have difficulty developing  manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies 
depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition  and the number of acquisitions we are concurrently integrating  our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors  including retaining key employees managing facilities and employees in different geographic areas retaining key customers  and integrating or coordinating different research and development  product manufacturing  and sales and marketing programs 
despite our efforts to adequately staff and equip our customer service and technical support operations  we cannot always respond promptly to customer requests for assistance 
we occasionally experience customer service and technical support problems  including longer than expected waiting times for customers when our staffing and systems are inadequate to handle a higher than anticipated volume of requests 
when we experience these problems  they can adversely affect customer relationships and our financial results due to lost revenue because of our inability to accept orders for our products or increased costs 
we also risk losing service at any one of our customer contact centers and our redundancy systems could prove inadequate to provide backup support 
in addition  our customer focused business strategy presents additional technical support challenges as we increase the number and complexity of the products we offer  particularly for our quickbooks  consumer tax and vertical business management solutions segments 
to improve our performance in this area  we must eliminate underlying causes of service and support requests through product improvements  better order fulfillment processes  more robust self help tools  and improved ability to accurately anticipate demand for support 
implementing any of these improvements can be expensive  time consuming and ultimately prove unsuccessful 
given the nature of the products and services that we offer  our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal 
several of our businesses are highly seasonal particularly our tax businesses  but also our small business software and service offerings to a lesser extent 
this causes significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results 
revenue and operating results are usually strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters ending january and april we experience lower revenues  and often significant operating losses  in the first and fourth quarters ending october and july recently we have recognized an increasing portion of our consumer tax revenue in the third fiscal quarter compared to the second fiscal quarter 
our financial results can also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors  including changes in product sales mix that affect average selling prices  product release dates  the timing of sales of our higher priced vertical business management solutions 
table of contents offerings  our methods for distributing our products  including the shift to a consignment model for our consumer tax products that we sell through retail distribution channels  and the timing of acquisitions  dispositions  and goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment charges 
we face risks relating to customer privacy and security and increasing regulation  which could hinder the growth of our businesses and affect our financial performance 
despite our efforts to address customer concerns about privacy and security  these issues still pose a risk to our business  and we have experienced lawsuits and negative publicity relating to privacy issues 
a major breach of customer privacy or security by intuit  or even by another company  could have serious consequences for our businesses  including reduced customer demand for our products and or additional regulation by federal or state agencies 
in addition  we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols 
if additional similar federal and state laws and or regulations like the recently created federal do not call list that govern our direct marketing activities such as telesales and email campaigns are passed  our ability to communicate with our customers may be further limited and our compliance costs may increase  both of which could have a negative impact on our operating results 
moreover  in response to concerns about their customers privacy  third parties such as internet service providers have developed  and may continue to develop  technology that limits or impedes our ability to communicate with our customers  particularly via email 
we face several risks relating to our retail distribution channel through which we sell our core desktop software products quickbooks  turbotax and quicken 
we face challenges with our relationships with retailers  including our ability to negotiate favorable terms with them  the risk that retailers could consolidate and potentially eliminate the number of retail locations in which our products are offered  and the negative effect of the current economic environment on retail sales generally 
in addition  any change in significant business terms  termination or significant disruption of our relationship with any of our major resellers could result in a decline in our revenue 
if any of our retailers experience financial difficulties  it could have an adverse effect on our operating expenses if uncollectible amounts from them exceed the bad debt reserves we have established 
we face additional risks in the retail channel as we execute on our customer focused product strategy through which we offer a collection of products and services that are tailored for a wide range of customers with differing needs 
we now offer several more stock keeping units skus than we have in the past and some of these products can be more complex and priced higher than our traditional retail software products and therefore pose new challenges for us in the retail channel 
for example  to market our quickbooks offerings at retail we have historically relied on product packaging  in store displays and other retail merchandising to educate customers about our products 
however  because our industry specific versions of quickbooks which we call flavors are priced higher  this strategy may prove less effective or ineffective given the increased need to educate potential customers about the added benefits of these products and the related higher pricing 
as a result  we may need to incur additional expenses to develop other marketing programs that supplement our traditional in store promotional efforts to sell these products to customers 
in addition  retailers may be reluctant to carry the higher priced skus because they are new offerings  and we have not yet been able to demonstrate demand for these products at levels that are desirable to our retailers 
finally  our customer focused product strategy and  in particular  our right for my business strategy is resulting in a greater number of intuit products that we re asking our retailers to stock 
therefore  we may experience difficulty in negotiating with our retailers to ensure that they will carry all of our skus and to ensure that they will carry an adequate supply of all of the different versions of our products in their stores 
if retail distribution proves an ineffective channel for certain of our new offerings and our quickbooks flavors in particular  it could adversely impact our growth  revenue and profitability 
acquisition related costs can cause significant fluctuation in our net income 
our recent acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses  including amortization of purchased software which is reflected in cost of revenue  as well as charges for in process research and development  and amortization and impairment of goodwill  purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation which are reflected in operating expenses 
total acquisition related costs in the categories identified above were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal fiscal acquisition related costs have declined primarily because of a change in the accounting treatment of goodwill 
however  we may incur less frequent  but larger  impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions 
as of july   we had an unamortized goodwill balance of approximately million  which could be subject to impairment charges in the 
table of contents future 
additional acquisitions  and any impairment of the value of purchased assets  could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results 
if we are required to account for options under our employee stock plans as a compensation expense  it would significantly reduce our net income and earnings per share 
although we are not currently required to record any compensation expense in connection with option grants to employees that have an exercise price at or above fair market value  it is possible that future laws or regulations will require us to treat all employee stock options as a compensation expense 
the increased compensation expense would significantly reduce our net income and earnings per share under generally accepted accounting principles 
if actual product returns exceed returns reserves our revenue would be lower 
we ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to sell  in order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers will run out of products 
this is particularly true for our consumer tax products  which have a short selling season and for which returns occur primarily in our fourth fiscal quarter 
like most software companies  we have historically accepted significant product returns 
we establish reserves against revenue for product returns in our financial statements  based on estimated future returns of products 
we closely monitor levels of product sales and inventory in the retail channel in an effort to maintain reserves that are adequate to cover expected returns 
in the past  returns have not generally exceeded these reserves 
however  if we do experience actual returns that significantly exceed reserves  it would result in lower net revenue 
we rely on third party vendors to handle all outsourced aspects of manufacturing and distribution for our primary retail and primary direct desktop software products 
to manufacture and distribute our primary retail products at the time of product launches and to replenish products in the retail channel after the primary launch  we have a manufacturing relationship with modus media  and a distribution arrangement with ingram micro logistics 
to manufacture and distribute our primary direct products quickbooks  turbotax and quicken  we have a manufacturing and distribution relationship with arvato services inc while we believe that relying on only three outsourcers for product launches and replenishment improves the efficiency and reliability of these activities  relying on any vendor for a significant aspect of our business can have severe negative consequences if the vendor fails to perform at acceptable service levels for any reason  including but not limited to financial difficulties of the vendor 
legal protection for our intellectual property is not always effective to prevent unauthorized use or copying 
current us laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection 
policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult  expensive  and time consuming 
in addition  efforts to protect our intellectual property may not be positively perceived by our customers 
although we continue to evaluate technology solutions to piracy  as well as increase our civil and criminal enforcement efforts  we expect piracy to be a persistent problem 
changes to federal or state laws and or regulations could impact our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights 
also  the internet may tend to increase  and provide new methods for  illegal copying of our desktop and internet based products and services 
in addition  we face risks relating to licensing our intellectual property to third parties 
for example  we licensed the use of the quicken loans and quicken mortgage trademarks to the purchaser of our quicken loans mortgage business 
if the purchaser violates the terms of the trademark license  it could result in serious harm to intuit s reputation and serious and irreparable harm to the value of our quicken related brands 
we do not own all of the software  other technologies and content used in our products and services 
we have the licenses from third parties that we believe are necessary for using technology and content that we do not own in our current products and services 
from time to time we may be required to renegotiate with these third parties or negotiate with new third parties to include their technology or content in our existing products  in new versions of our current products or in new products 
we may not be able to negotiate or renegotiate licenses on reasonable terms  or at all 
if we re unable to obtain the rights necessary to use third party technology or content in our products and services  we may not be able to sell the affected products  which would in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results 
we may unintentionally infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  which could expose us to substantial damages or restrict our business operations 
as the number of our products and services increases and their features and content continue to expand  and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses  we may increasingly become subject to infringement claims by third parties 
from time to time  we have received communications from 
table of contents third parties in which the claimant alleges that a product or service we offer infringes the claimant s intellectual property rights 
occasionally these communications result in lawsuits 
in many of these cases  it is difficult to assess the extent to which the intellectual property right that the claimant asserts is valid or the extent to which we have any material exposure 
past claims have not resulted in any significant litigation  settlement or licensing expenses  but future claims could present an exposure of uncertain magnitude 
existing or future infringement claims or lawsuits against us  whether valid or not  may be time consuming and expensive to defend 
intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following cease selling  incorporating or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property  which may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all  or redesign our software products or services  possibly in a manner that reduces their commercial appeal 
any of these actions may cause material harm to our business and financial results 
specific factors affecting our quickbooks  small business products and services and vertical business management solutions segments in our quickbooks and our small business products and services businesses  we face a wide range of competitive risks that could impact our financial results 
our quickbooks business faces current competition from competitors desktop and web based software offerings 
many competitors and potential competitors have begun providing  or have expressed significant interest in providing  accounting and business management products and services to small businesses 
as we expand the depth and breadth of our small business offerings  we face additional competition from others who are already offering industry specific small business solutions and business management tools and services for larger small businesses 
microsoft has several small business offerings that compete with our small business offerings  including microsoft business solutions small business manager  microsoft busines solutions crm and business contact manager for microsoft office outlook we expect that microsoft small business offerings will continue to compete with our small business offerings  perhaps even more directly in the future 
in addition  we face direct competition in our intuit payroll services complete payroll business from traditional payroll services offered by a number of companies  including adp and paychex 
our financial supplies business faces ongoing pricing pressures from many of our competitors 
as we implement our right for my business strategy we face increased competitive threats from larger companies in bigger markets than we have historically faced 
we face competitive pressures in our vertical business management solutions segment 
all of our vertical business management solutions businesses operate in highly competitive and fragmented environments where no competitor has a significant share of the market segment 
we may experience pricing pressure in these market segments because we compete with many small companies  who have fewer resources than larger companies and are therefore more likely to focus on near term sales 
in each of these market segments  the possibility exists that through either consolidation within the market segment or the entry into the market segment of new companies a significant competitor will emerge 
it is too soon to provide assurance that we will be able to generate substantial and sustained revenue growth from new products and services in the quickbooks  small business products and services and vertical business management solutions segments 
to meet our growth goals  we must generate revenue from a wider range of market and customer segments  as well as from new products and services 
there are a number of risks associated with our growth strategy  including we may have difficulty identifying potential targets for acquisition 
our strategy depends on our successfully completing acquisitions and integrating acquired companies  which presents a number of challenges as described above under company wide risk factors 
our right for my business strategy is resulting in a dramatic increase in the number and complexity of the products and services that we offer 
this places greater demands on our research and development  and marketing and sales resources  as we must develop  market and sell both the new products and services and periodic enhancements to an expanding portfolio of products and services 
this will also require us to continually develop  expand and modify our internal business operations systems and procedures to gain better integration so we can support our new businesses  including our customer service and technical support contact centers  and our customer management  order management  billing and other systems 

table of contents many of the new products and services we offer  and will be offering  are much more complex than our traditional core desktop software products and are priced accordingly 
they will therefore require a more consultative sales process and a higher level of post sales support  both of which could result in higher selling and marketing expenses 
if we are not able to effectively adapt our marketing  sales  distribution and customer support functions to accommodate these changes  we will not succeed in generating significant or sustained revenue or net income from these new businesses 
our acquisition strategy entails a number of challenges that could limit our successful implementation of the strategy 
a key component of our right for my business strategy is to continue to expand our product and service offerings  and we expect to derive a significant portion of this expansion from acquisitions 
we could face the following risks relating to our strategy and future acquisitions  in addition to the integration challenges noted above competition for acquisition opportunities could inhibit our ability to complete suitable acquisitions  and could also increase the price we would have to pay to complete acquisitions 
if we are unable to complete acquisitions successfully  we may not be able to develop and market products for new industries or applications with which we may not be familiar 
despite our due diligence reviews  acquired businesses may bring with them unanticipated liabilities  business or legal risks or operating costs that could harm our results of operations or business  reduce or eliminate any benefits of the acquisition or require unanticipated expenses 
future acquisitions may require us to issue shares of our stock and stock options to owners of the acquired businesses  which would result in dilution to the equity interests of our stockholders 
if we fail to retain the services of key employees of acquired companies for significant time periods after we acquire their companies  we may experience difficulty in managing the acquired company s business and not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
revenue growth for our vertical business management solutions segment may be hindered by a variety of factors  which could have a negative impact on overall company revenue growth 
revenue growth for our vertical business management solutions business is subject to numerous risks 
among these are the negative impact of the current economic environment on customer purchases of the relatively high priced software solutions offered by these businesses  strong pricing pressure in these markets because we compete with many small companies  who have fewer resources than larger companies and are therefore more likely to focus on near term sales  our ability to successfully acquire other companies and the potential disruption to the businesses of the acquired companies during the acquisition integration process 
in addition  revenue growth in any particular period may be difficult to predict because of the complex revenue streams generated by these businesses  and the corresponding complexity in the accounting policies that apply to them 
our financial supplies business relies on a single source vendor 
we have an exclusive contract with john h 
harland company to print and fulfill supplies orders for all of our checks and most other products for our financial supplies business 
harland fulfilled orders for about to of our supplies revenue in fiscal and  and almost of our supplies revenue in fiscal we believe that relying on one vendor improves customer service and maximizes operational efficiencies for our supplies business 
however  if there are significant problems with harland s performance  it could have a material negative impact on sales of supplies and on intuit s financial results as a whole 
our payroll businesses face a number of risks that could have a negative impact on revenue and profitability 
for our payroll businesses  we must process customer data accurately  reliably and timely in order to attract and retain customers and avoid the costs associated with errors 
we must also accurately and timely develop new and upgraded payroll products to enable our customers to meet the various regulatory deadlines associated with employer related payroll activities 
if we failed to timely deliver any of our payroll products  it could cause our current and prospective customers to choose a competitor s product for that year s payroll and not to purchase intuit products in the future 
in order to generate sustained growth for our intuit payroll services complete payroll  we will be required to successfully develop and manage a more extensive and proactive direct field sales operation  which is a different distribution method than those we have historically utilized 
as our payroll businesses involve the processing of large amounts of payroll funds and the remittance of large amounts of income taxes  there is a potential for errors in processing the payments or misappropriation of payroll funds by either our customers 
table of contents employees or our own employees 
any such error or misappropriation could subject intuit to liabilities that could be substantial 
in addition  we are authorized by our customers to transfer money from their bank accounts to fund amounts owed to their employees and taxing authorities 
it is possible that we could be held liable for such amounts in the event the client has insufficient funds to cover them 
moreover  our payroll businesses  other than our do it yourself product  include as part of their revenue interest on customer deposits not yet remitted to taxing authorities or to customers employees 
if interest rates decline  or there take effect regulatory changes either decreasing the amount of taxes withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to taxing authorities  it would result in less interest revenue for those businesses 
if any of the above eventualities came to pass  it could have a negative impact on the revenue  profitability and future growth of our payroll businesses 
specific factors affecting our consumer tax and professional accounting solutions segments we face intense competitive pressures from both the private and public sectors in our consumer tax and professional accounting solutions businesses that could have a negative impact on revenue  profitability and market position 
there are formidable current and potential competitors in the private sector for both our consumer and professional tax products  and we expect competition to remain intense in the future 
our major domestic competitor for both desktop and web based consumer tax software continues to be h r block  the makers of taxcut software  and our largest professional tax competitors are cch incorporated  with its prosystem fx product line  kleinrock publishing  with its atx product line  and the thomson corporation  with its creative solutions and gosystem offerings 
these competitive pressures can have a negative impact on our revenue  profitability and market position 
in addition  we face current and potential competition from a number of publicly funded government entities that are offering individual taxpayers electronic tax preparation and or filing services  at no cost to individual taxpayers 
if governmental agencies are able to develop consumer tax preparation and filing services and to gain consumer acceptance of those services  it could have a negative impact on our financial results in future years 
the federal government signed a three year free file alliance agreement in october under which a number of private sector companies  rather than the federal government  are providing web based federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost through voluntary public services initiatives such as our intuit tax freedom project 
however  future administrative  regulatory or legislative activity in this area could have a strong adverse impact the financial performance of our consumer tax and professional accounting solutions businesses 
the product activation technology that we introduced into certain turbotax desktop products last year could have an adverse impact on this year s results for our consumer tax business 
during tax year  federal versions of turbotax desktop products for windows included product activation technology that helped to prevent unlicensed users from using pass along and or counterfeit copies of turbotax to print or electronically file a tax return 
the introduction of product activation generated negative commentary in the media and in online forums and also resulted in a modest increase in the volume of customers contacting our customer service and technical support centers 
while we have publicly announced that we will not include product activation in retail versions of turbotax for windows for the upcoming tax season  there is uncertainty about whether the negative publicity and customer reactions to  and experiences with  this technology last year will impact our consumer tax business this year 
any significant negative repercussions relating to product activation could adversely impact our fiscal results for our consumer tax business  in particular  and our financial performance as a whole 
significant problems or delays in developing our consumer tax and professional tax products would result in lost revenue and customers 
developing tax preparation software presents a unique challenge because of the demanding annual development cycle required to incorporate unpredictable tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products 
our tax preparation software business  which represents a substantial portion of our annual revenue  is highly seasonal since the customers in that market generally prepare and file their taxes by april a significantly late product launch could result in lost revenue and lost customers 
it could cause our current and prospective customers to choose a competitor s product for that year s tax season or to choose not to purchase tax preparation software at all 
these risks could result in lost revenue in the current tax year and would make it more difficult for us to sell our products to customers in future tax seasons 
moreover  the rigid development timetable increases the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays 
any major defects could lead to negative publicity  customer dissatisfaction and incremental 
table of contents operating expenses  including expenses resulting from our commitment to reimburse penalties and interest paid by consumer customers due solely to calculation errors in our products 
if we fail to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our electronic tax offerings  we could lose revenue and customers 
our web based tax preparation and electronic filing services must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during the peak tax season and the exact level of demand for these offerings is difficult to predict 
we face significant risks and challenges in maintaining these services and maintaining adequate service levels  particularly during peak volume service times 
for example  we experienced a relatively brief unscheduled interruption in our electronic filing service on april  during which certain users of our professional tax products were unable to receive confirmation from us that their electronic filing had been accepted 
we also experienced relatively brief unscheduled interruptions in our electronic filing 
and or tax preparation services during tax years and  and we reached maximum capacity for a short period on april  we also face risks related to the performance of our redundancy and data recoverability systems in these businesses 
if our redundancy and data recoverability systems are inadequate  then we could lose the ability to provide these services or provided these services at inadequate levels to our customers 
if we experience any prolonged difficulties with our web based tax preparation or electronic filing service at any time during the tax season  we could lose current and future customers  receive negative publicity and incur increased operating costs  any of which could have a significant negative impact on the financial and market success of these businesses and have a negative impact on our near term and long term financial results 
increased state filing mandates could significantly increase our costs 
we are required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services 
changes in state imposed requirements by one or more of the states  including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards  could significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers 
if we are unable to significantly increase accountant facilitated sales  it could have a negative impact on revenue growth 
we are currently focused on developing relationships with accounting professionals in order to expand our opportunities to sell small business products and services to their clients under our right for my firm  right for my clients strategy 
we view this strategy as an important driver for our professional accounting solutions segment  as well as our quickbooks and small business products and services businesses 
however  since this is a new model for us  we face several risks associated with it  including the risk that we will not be able to effectively execute this strategy and the risk that we will not derive the anticipated benefits including financial benefits from this strategy 
we face intense competition in this effort  as there are an increasing number of alliances between accountants and other professional tax preparers and providers of small business software and services that aim to capitalize on accountant facilitated sales of small business products and services to their clients 
specific factors affecting our other businesses segment our other businesses products face competition that could have a negative impact on revenue  profitability and market position 
our quicken products compete domestically and internationally directly with microsoft money  which is aggressively promoted and priced 
we expect competitive pressures for quicken to continue  both from microsoft money and from web based personal finance tracking and management tools that are becoming increasingly available at no cost to consumers 
competitive pressures can result in reduced revenue and lower profitability for our quicken product line 
in canada  we face competition from a number of companies in the small business  consumer tax and professional tax businesses 
the long term viability of our personal finance business will depend on our ability to provide new products and services that attract customers 
the demand for personal finance desktop software products such as our quicken offering has been weakening over recent years due to the increasing availability of free web based personal finance tracking and management tools through financial institutions and others 
in addition  the demand for internet advertising on web sites like quicken 
com has declined precipitously 
we must identify and capitalize on additional sources of revenue for our personal finance business to continue to grow that business and we face the risk that any approach that we take to increase revenue for this business may not succeed 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk short term investment portfolio we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our short term investment portfolio 
our short term investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards consistent with our investment policy 
this policy specifies that  except for direct obligations of the united states government and money market or cash management funds  we diversify our holdings and limit our short term investments with any individual issuer to a maximum of million in each of our three managed portfolios 
the following table of our short term investments portfolio is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and reflects instruments with both taxable and tax exempt interest rates 
principal amounts by stated maturity in thousands  except interest rates years ending july  fair value and july  thereafter total cash equivalents average interest rate short term investments average interest rate total portfolio average interest rate interest rate risk our cash equivalents and short term investment portfolio are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and short term investments and the value of those investments 
over the past few years  we have experienced significant reductions in our interest income due to declines in interest rates 
these declines have led to interest rates that are low by historical standards and we do not believe that further decreases in interest rates will have a material impact on the interest income earned on our cash equivalents and short term investments held at july  impact of foreign currency rate changes we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars and british pounds into u 
s dollars for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results  though the historical impact has generally been immaterial 
we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies 
there was a nominal currency exchange impact from our intercompany transactions for fiscal and due to the effect of the weakening us dollar on intercompany balances with our canadian subsidiary  we recorded foreign currency exchange gains of million in fiscal although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future  there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future 
as of july   we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
