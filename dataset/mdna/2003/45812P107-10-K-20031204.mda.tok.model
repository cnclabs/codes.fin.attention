item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a fabless semiconductor company that designs and markets high performance integrated circuits for the following key markets i digital consumer electronics  ii networking  iii mobile communications and iv automotive electronics 
our primary products are high speed and low power sram and low and medium density dram 
we were founded in october and initially focused on high performance  low cost sram for pc cache memory applications 
in  we introduced our first low and medium density dram products 
in and  we began to focus on the networking  internet access and telecommunications markets and  by  revenue from such markets represented a substantial majority of our net sales 
due to our focus on these markets  we recorded revenues of million in the quarter ended december  these markets experienced a substantial downturn beginning in which resulted in a significant decline in our revenues  significant inventory write offs and large operating losses 
in response to these adverse market conditions  we increased our focus on the digital consumer electronics  mobile communications and automotive electronics markets and also reduced our operating expenses 
as a result of our success in the digital consumer electronics market  sales of our low and medium density dram products have increased significantly and represented a majority of our net sales in fiscal as a fabless semiconductor company  our business model is less capital intensive because we rely on third parties to manufacture  assemble and test our products 
however  as a result of our dependence on third party wafer foundries  our ability to increase our unit sales volumes depends on our ability to increase our wafer capacity allocation from current foundries  add additional foundries and improve yields of die per wafer 
although average selling prices of our sram and dram products have generally declined over time  the selling prices are very sensitive to supply and demand conditions in our target markets 
for most of fiscal  average selling prices for our products declined as they had in recent years 
more recently  market conditions have improved and prices have stabilized and in some cases increased 
we expect average selling prices for our products to decline in the future  principally due to continuing and increased market competition and an increased supply of competitive products in the market 
any future decreases in our average selling prices would have an adverse impact on our revenue growth rate  gross margins and operating margins 
our ability to maintain or increase revenues will be highly dependent upon our ability to increase unit sales volumes of existing products and to introduce and sell new products in quantities sufficient to compensate for the anticipated declines in average selling prices of existing products 
declining average selling prices will adversely affect gross margins unless we are able to offset such declines with commensurate reductions in per unit costs or changes in product mix in favor of higher margin products 
revenue from product sales to our direct customers is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining significant obligations 
a portion of our sales is made to distributors under agreements that provide the possibility of certain sales price rebates and limited product return privileges 
given the uncertainties associated with the levels of returns and other credits that will be issued to these distributors  we defer recognition of such sales until our products are sold by the distributors to their end customers 
revenue from sales to distributors who do not have sales price rebates or product return privileges is recognized at the time our products are sold by us to the distributors 

table of contents we market and sell our products in asia  the us and europe through our direct sales force  distributors and sales representatives 
the percentage of our revenues from customers located outside the us was approximately  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in our revenues from asia is due to our success in the digital consumer electronics market 
we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to represent a significant percentage of our net sales 
the percentages of our revenues by region are set forth in the following table fiscal year ended september  asia europe us total our sales are generally made by purchase orders 
because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice  backlog is not a good indicator of our future sales 
cancellations of customer orders or changes in product specifications could result in the loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses 
since a significant portion of our revenue is from the digital consumer electronics market  our business may be subject to seasonality  with increased revenues in the third and fourth calendar quarters of each year  when customers place orders to meet year end holiday demand 
however  broad fluctuations in our overall business in the past several years makes it difficult for us to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business 
we hold equity interests in a number of other companies 
we acquired these interests for strategic reasons  such as developing a strong relationship with a third party wafer foundry we rely on to manufacture our products 
our financial results for fiscal and fiscal reflect accounting for icsi on the equity basis and include our percentage share of the results of icsi s operations 
our financial results for fiscal through the period ended april  and for fiscal reflect accounting for e cmos technology corporation on the equity basis and include our percentage share of the results of e cmos operations 
effective may  our ownership of e cmos became less than and we began accounting for e cmos on the cost basis 
our financial results for fiscal and fiscal reflect accounting for getsilicon  nexflash technologies  signia technologies and smic on the cost basis 
icsi is a taiwan based fabless memory supplier  and e cmos is a taiwan based peripherals interface device company  getsilicon is a semiconductor supply chain management software company  nexflash is a flash memory supplier  signia technologies is a developer of wireless semiconductors  and smic is a china based semiconductor foundry 
at september   we owned approximately of icsi  approximately of e cmos  approximately of getsilicon  approximately of nexflash  approximately of signia technologies and less than of smic 
in october  we invested million for a interest in dcode  a subsidiary that we established in korea to focus on semiconductor design activities 
in  we transferred key designers to our us team  and  at september   we were in the process of winding down the operations of dcode 
we are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  including economic conditions in asia  particularly taiwan and china  changes in trade policy and regulatory requirements  duties  tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions  the burdens of complying with foreign laws and  possibly  political instability 
all of our foundries and assembly and test subcontractors are located in asia 
although we transact business predominately in us dollars  we do have some transactions in new taiwan dollars  in hong kong dollars and in china renminbi 
such transactions expose us to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
we monitor our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  but have not to date adopted any hedging strategy 
there can be no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business and operating results in the future 

table of contents fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september net sales 
net sales consist principally of total product sales less estimated sales returns 
net sales increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in sales was principally due to an increase in unit shipments of our dram products  specifically our  and mb devices  partially offset by declines in the average selling prices for such products in fiscal compared to fiscal while sram units shipped increased slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal  the impact of the reduction in average selling prices for such products resulted in an overall reduction in our sram revenue 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of our existing products will decline over time  although the rate of decline may fluctuate for certain products 
in this regard  the average selling prices for certain of our sram products declined in the three months ended september  compared to the three months ended june  however  the average selling prices for certain of our dram products increased in the three months ended september  compared to the three months ended june  there can be no assurance that any future price declines will be offset by higher volumes or by higher prices on newer products 
sales to atm electronic corporation  one of our asian distributors  accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal a substantial portion of our sales to atm were for delivery to ambit 
in fiscal  no single customer accounted for over of net sales 
as sales to atm are executed pursuant to purchase orders and no purchasing contract exists  this customer may cease doing business with us at any time 
gross profit loss 
cost of sales includes die cost from the wafers acquired from foundries  subcontracted package  assembly and test costs  costs associated with in house product testing  quality assurance and import duties 
gross profit increased by million to million gross profit in fiscal from million gross loss in fiscal gross margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded inventory write downs of million predominately for lower of cost or market adjustments 
we recorded inventory write downs of million in fiscal predominately for lower of cost or market adjustments and to a lesser extent  excess inventory 
our gross margin for fiscal benefited from the reversal of approximately million in antidumping duties previously charged to cost of sales as a result of the favorable termination of an antidumping case 
in fiscal  we charged million to cost of sales for the write off of a prepaid license fee as the average selling price for the impacted parts was less than the cost of the parts 
excluding the inventory write downs  the benefit of the reversal of antidumping duties and the write off of the prepaid license fee  the increase in gross profit was principally due to an increase in unit shipments of our dram products and  to a lesser extent  our sram products  in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  reductions in the cost of our dram and sram products more than offset declines in the average selling prices of such products in fiscal compared to fiscal  resulting in an increase in gross profit 
we believe that the average selling prices of our products will decline over time and  unless we are able to reduce our cost per unit to the extent necessary to offset such declines  the decline in average selling prices will result in a material decline in our gross margin 
in addition  product unit costs could increase if our suppliers raise prices  which could result in a material decline in our gross margin 
in the past  foundries have raised wafer prices when demand for end products increases 
we have recently seen some foundries raising wafer prices in response to increased demand conditions 
although we have product cost reduction programs in place that involve efforts to reduce internal costs and supplier costs  there can be no assurance that product costs will be reduced or that such reductions will be sufficient to offset the expected declines in average selling prices 
we do not believe that such cost reduction efforts are likely to have a material adverse impact on the quality of our products or the level of service provided by us 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in absolute dollars was primarily the result of a reduction in expenses associated with new product development as we limited the focus of our development efforts resulting in a substantial reduction in mask costs and engineering wafers 
in addition  we reduced research and development expenses through salary reductions  headcount reductions and the transfer of 
table of contents some design and engineering efforts to asia 
in fiscal  we recorded a million charge for the sale of fixed assets as a result of closing our design centers in hong kong and korea 
in fiscal  we wrote off the unamortized balance of the purple ray patent applications of approximately million 
the increased costs associated with the development of new products could result in our research and development expenses increasing in absolute dollars in future periods 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in absolute dollars was primarily the result of controlling expenses through salary reductions  headcount reductions and limiting discretionary spending 
if our business activity increases and in response to recent changes in corporate governance rules  we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future quarters  although such expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of net sales 
in process technology 
on february   we acquired purple ray 
the assets of purple ray consisted primarily of intellectual property 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the total purchase price of million consisted of the fair market value of issi s common stock of million  the fair value of options to purchase purple ray common stock assumed by issi of million and transaction costs of million 
the transaction resulted in an in process technology charge of million in our march  quarter 
gain on sale of investments 
the gain on the sale of investments increased to million in fiscal from  in fiscal in fiscal  we sold shares of e cmos for approximately million which resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
in fiscal  we sold shares of icsi for approximately  resulting in a pre tax gain of  other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  decreased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of a million decrease in interest income as the result of lower cash balances and interest rates 
in fiscal  we recorded an impairment loss of approximately million on our investment in signia technologies based on the share price of a subsequent investment in signia technologies in july in addition  in fiscal  we recorded a charge of approximately million related to the decline in the fair value of an embedded derivative associated with the icsi convertible debenture 
fiscal includes a write off of approximately million for the impairment of certain of our equity investments 
provision benefit for income taxes 
we recorded a tax provision of approximately  for fiscal compared to a tax benefit of approximately million for fiscal the provision for income taxes for fiscal reflects taxes for foreign jurisdictions 
we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million for fiscal that principally reflected our ability to recover alternative minimum taxes previously incurred as a result of changes in tax laws in equity in net loss of affiliated companies 
equity in net loss of affiliated companies decreased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this primarily reflects a decrease in the loss from our percentage share of icsi s financial results in fiscal compared to fiscal minority interest in net loss of consolidated subsidiary 
in october  we invested million for a interest in dcode  a subsidiary that we established in korea to focus on semiconductor design activities 
the results of their operations are included in our consolidated financial statements 
the minority interest in net loss of consolidated subsidiary decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal in fiscal  we closed dcode and transferred certain personnel to our facilities 

table of contents fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september net sales 
net sales decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in sales was principally due to a significant decline in the average selling prices of our products in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  in fiscal  we experienced a decrease in unit shipments for our sram products  specifically our k x  k  k and k x sram products 
we were able to partially offset the decline in our dram revenue resulting from the decline in average selling prices with an increase in dram units shipped 
in fiscal  no single customer accounted for over of net sales 
sales to flextronics international accounted for approximately of net sales for fiscal substantially all of our sales to flextronics were for products to be delivered to cisco systems 
shipments for cisco directly  or indirectly through subcontractors  accounted for approximately of net sales for fiscal sales to com accounted for approximately of net sales for fiscal shipments for com directly  or indirectly through subcontractors  accounted for approximately of net sales for fiscal gross profit loss 
gross profit decreased to a loss of million in fiscal from a profit of million in fiscal gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded inventory write downs of million  predominately for lower of cost or market accounting on our dram and sram products and  to a lesser extent  excess inventory 
we recorded inventory write downs of million in fiscal these write downs were predominately for lower of cost or market accounting on certain of our products  primarily dram products and low power sram products 
in fiscal  we charged million to cost of sales for the write off of a prepaid license fee as the average selling price for the impacted parts were less than the cost of the parts 
additionally  the technology included in the license had no alternative use to us beyond its application in the impacted parts 
as a result of the termination of the antidumping case  our gross margin for fiscal benefited from the reversal of approximately million in antidumping duties previously charged to cost of sales 
excluding the inventory write downs  the write off of the prepaid license fee and the benefit of the reversal of antidumping duties  the decrease in gross profit was principally due to a significant decline in the average selling prices of our products in fiscal compared to fiscal further  as we sell products that had previously been written down to lower of cost or market  we recognize minimal gross profit 
the decline in our gross margin in fiscal was more significant for our sram products than for our dram products 
in addition  we were able to offset some of the decline in average selling prices of our dram products with an increase in dram units shipped 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars was the result our acquisition of purple ray  the expansion of our research and development activities in asia  and increased expenses for engineering wafers related to the development of new products 
in the three months ended september  we wrote off the unamortized balance of the purple ray patent applications of approximately million 
the write off was made as it became evident  based on anticipated cash flows  that the product line had not and would not meet the goals that we had at the time the acquisition was made and that we would not recover any value for the patent applications 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in absolute dollars was primarily the result of decreased selling commissions associated with lower revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  payroll related expenses decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of salary reductions and reductions in headcount 
in process technology 
in february  we acquired purple ray  a development stage company 
the assets of purple ray consisted primarily of intellectual property 
the transaction was accounted for using the 
table of contents purchase method of accounting 
the total purchase price of million consisted of the fair market value of our common stock issued of million  the fair value of options to purchase purple ray common stock assumed by us of million  and transaction costs of million 
in connection with the acquisition of purple ray in fiscal  we allocated million of the total purchase price of million to in process technology 
this allocation represented the estimated fair value based on discounted cash flows related to the in process projects 
at the date of the acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date 
management is primarily responsible for estimating the fair value of the in process technology  which was determined with the assistance of an independent appraiser 
at the acquisition date  purple ray was developing four products that were expected to feature sophisticated parallel search architecture to enhance lookup performance for oc and advanced data communication equipment 
the products under development ranged from to complete 
we allocated values to in process technology based on the stage of development of each product  the time and resources needed to complete each product  and the expected income and associated risks 
the value assigned to acquired in process technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the products  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projection used to value the in process technology was based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the expected timing of new product introductions 
the resulting net cash flows from such products were based on management s estimates of cost of sales  operating expenses  and income taxes from such product offerings 
revenues for the products under development were estimated to grow based on forecasted sales for the three years following introduction  assuming successful completion and market acceptance of the products under development 
the estimated revenues for the in process products were expected to peak within four years of acquisition and then decline as other new products and technologies are expected to enter the market 
the rate utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value was based on an estimated cost of capital calculation 
we utilized a discount rate of for the in process technology  which we believed was commensurate with the inherent risk and the expected growth of the in process products 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income  net  decreased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of decreased interest income as the result of the decline in interest rates and lower cash balances 
in addition  fiscal includes a write off of approximately million for the impairment of certain of our equity investments 
gain on sale of investment 
the gain on sale of investments decreased by million to  in fiscal from million in fiscal in fiscal  we sold shares of icsi for approximately  resulting in a pre tax gain of  in fiscal  we sold our interest in wafertech to tsmc for approximately million  which resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
during fiscal  we also recorded gross proceeds of approximately million and a pre tax gain of approximately million in connection with our sale of shares of icsi  and gross proceeds of approximately million and a pre tax gain of approximately million in connection with our sale of shares of nexflash 
provision benefit for income taxes 
we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million for fiscal compared to a tax expense of million for fiscal we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million for fiscal  that principally reflects our ability to recover alternative minimum taxes previously incurred as a result of changes in tax law in we recorded a tax expense of million for fiscal  primarily due to the inability to realize deferred tax assets related to our net operating loss and tax credit

minority interest in net loss of consolidated subsidiary 
in october  we invested million for a interest in dcode 
the results of their operations are included in our consolidated financial statements 
the  minority interest in net loss of consolidated subsidiary represents the minority shareholders proportionate share of the net loss of dcode 
equity in net income loss of affiliated companies 
equity in net income loss of affiliated companies decreased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this primarily reflects a decrease in income from our percentage share of icsi s financial results in fiscal from fiscal quarterly results of operations the following table presents our historical unaudited quarterly results of operations for our most recent eight fiscal quarters

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of september   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million 
during fiscal  operating activities used cash of approximately million compared to million in fiscal cash used by operations was in fiscal primarily due to our net loss of million adjusted for non cash charges including depreciation and amortization of million  equity in net loss of affiliated companies of million  loss on impairment of investment of million and other non cash items of million  as well as decreases in accounts payable of million and increases in accounts receivables of million  partially offset by decreases in inventories of million primarily driven by inventory write downs  decreases in other assets of million and increases in accrued expenses of million 
in fiscal  we generated million from investing activities compared to million generated in fiscal the cash generated by investing activities in fiscal primarily resulted from net sales of available for sale securities of million 
in fiscal  we sold shares of e cmos for million which resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
in addition  in fiscal  we made an additional investment of million in smic and other investments of million 
the cash generated from investing activities in fiscal was primarily the result of net sales of available for sale securities of million 
in addition  in fiscal  we made additional investments totaling million in smic and other investments of million including million in icsi convertible debentures and million in e cmos 
in fiscal  we made capital expenditures of approximately million for engineering tools  computer software and leasehold improvements 
in addition  we received approximately million from the sale of fixed assets 
we expect to spend approximately million to million to purchase capital equipment during the next twelve months  principally for the purchase of design and engineering tools  additional test equipment  and computer software and hardware 
we generated million from financing activities during fiscal compared to million in fiscal cash generated from financing activities for fiscal was primarily the result of proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million from option exercises and sales under our employee stock purchase plan 
the primary source of financing for fiscal was proceeds from the issuance of our common stock of million from option exercises and sales under our employee stock purchase plan 
we lease our facilities including our headquarters in santa clara  california  our field sales offices in the us and europe  and sales and engineering offices in asia 
our leases expire at various dates through our outstanding commitments under these leases are approximately million 
we generally warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of months 
liability for a stated warranty period is usually limited to replacement of defective items or return of amounts paid 
warranty expense has historically been immaterial to our financial statements 
our contractual cash obligations at september  are outlined in the table below payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years in thousands operating leases unconditional purchase obligations with wafer foundries total contractual cash obligations 
table of contents we believe our existing funds will satisfy our anticipated working capital and other cash requirements through at least the next months 
we may from time to time take actions to further increase our cash position through equity or debt financings  sales of shares of investments  bank borrowings  or the disposition of certain assets 
from time to time  we may also evaluate potential acquisitions or equity investments including strategic investments in wafer fabrication foundries or assembly and test subcontractors 
to the extent we pursue such transactions  any such transaction could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing to fund such activities 
there can be no assurance that any such additional financing could be obtained on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make difficult and subjective estimates  judgments and assumptions 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
the estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience combined with knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future  considering the information available at the time 
actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to our financial statements 
we reevaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
our critical accounting policies which are impacted by our estimates are i the valuation of our inventory  which impacts cost of goods sold and gross profit  ii the valuation of our allowance for sales returns and allowances  which impacts net sales  iii the valuation of our allowance for doubtful accounts  which impacts general and administrative expense  and iv the valuation of our non marketable equity securities  which impacts gains and losses on equity securities when we record impairments 
each of these policies is described in more detail below 
we also have other key accounting policies that may not require us to make estimates and judgments that are as subjective or difficult  for instance  our policies with regard to revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenues on sales to distributors with sales price rebates and product return privileges 
these policies are described in the notes to our financial statements contained elsewhere in this prospectus 
valuation of inventory 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
determining market value requires us to project unit prices and volumes for future periods in which we expect to sell inventory on hand as of the balance sheet date 
as a result of these estimates  we may record a charge to cost of goods sold  which decreases our gross profit  in advance of when the inventory is actually sold to reflect market values that are below our manufacturing and sales commission costs 
conversely  if we sell inventory that has previously been written down to the lower of cost or market at more favorable prices than we had forecasted at the time of the write down  our gross profit may be higher 
in addition to lower of cost or market write downs  we also analyze inventory to determine whether any of it is excess  obsolete or defective 
we write down to zero dollars which is a charge to cost of goods sold the carrying value of inventory on hand in excess of six months estimated sales volumes to cover estimated excess and obsolete exposures  unless adjustments are made to the forecast based on our judgments for newer products  end of life products or planned inventory increases 
in making such judgments to write down inventory  we take into account the product life cycles which can range from six to months  the stage in the life cycle of the product  and the impact of competitors announcements and product introductions on our products 
valuation of allowance for sales returns and allowances 
net sales consist principally of total product sales less estimated sales returns 
to estimate sales returns and allowances  we analyze potential customer specific product application issues  potential quality and reliability issues and historical returns 
we evaluate quarterly the adequacy of the reserve for sales returns and allowances 
this reserve is reflected as a reduction to accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets 
increases to the reserve are recorded as a reduction to net 
table of contents sales 
because the reserve for sales returns and allowances is based on our judgments and estimates  particularly as to product application  quality and reliability issues  our reserves may not be adequate to cover actual sales returns and other allowances 
if our reserves are not adequate  our net sales could be adversely affected 
valuation of allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments for goods and services purchased from us 
we make our estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
once an account is deemed unlikely to be fully collected  we write down the carrying value of the receivable to the estimated recoverable value  which results in a charge to general and administrative expense  which decreases our profitability 
valuation of non marketable securities 
our ability to recover our strategic investments in equity securities that are non marketable and to earn a return on these investments is largely dependent on financial market conditions and the occurrence of liquidity events  such as initial public offerings  mergers or acquisitions  and private equity transactions 
the timing of when any of these events may occur is uncertain and very difficult to predict 
in addition  under our accounting policy  we are required to periodically review all of our investments for impairment 
in the case of non marketable equity securities  this requires significant judgment on our part  including an assessment of the investees financial condition  the existence of subsequent rounds of financing and the impact of any relevant equity preferences  as well as the investees historical results of operations and projected results and cash flows 
if the actual outcomes for the investees are significantly different from their forecasts  the carrying value of our non marketable equity securities may be overstated  and we may incur additional charges in future periods  which will decrease our profitability 
at september   our strategic investments in non marketable securities totaled million of which million was invested in smic 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
fin requires certain variable interest entities  or vies  to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective for all new vies created or acquired after january  for vies created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period ending after december  the adoption of fin has not and is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
certain factors which may affect our business or future operating results risks related to our business we have incurred significant losses in certain recent periods  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
we have incurred losses in the ten consecutive quarters ended september  totaling million 
we may incur losses in subsequent quarters 
our ability to achieve or maintain profitability on a quarterly or fiscal year basis in the future will depend on a variety of factors  including our ability to increase net sales  expand gross margins  introduce new products on a timely basis  secure sufficient wafer fabrication capacity and control operating expenses 
adverse developments with respect to these or other factors could result in quarterly or annual operating losses in the future 

table of contents if we are unable to obtain an adequate supply of wafers  our business will be harmed 
if we are unable to obtain an adequate supply of wafers from our current suppliers or any alternative sources in a timely manner  our business will be harmed 
our principal manufacturing relationships are with semiconductor manufacturing international corporation  or smic  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation  or tsmc  chartered semiconductor manufacturing  promos technologies and powerchip semiconductor 
each of our wafer foundries also supplies wafers to other semiconductor companies  including certain of our competitors 
although we are allocated specific wafer capacity from our suppliers  we may not be able to obtain such capacity in periods of tight supply 
if any of our suppliers experience manufacturing failures or yield shortfalls  choose to prioritize capacity for other uses  or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us  we may not be able to obtain enough wafers to meet the market demand for our products which would adversely affect our revenues 
once a product is in production at a particular foundry  it is time consuming and costly to have such product manufactured at a different foundry 
in addition  we may not be able to qualify additional manufacturing sources for existing or new products in a timely manner and we cannot be certain that other manufacturing sources would agree to deliver an adequate supply of wafers to us 
our operating results are expected to continue to fluctuate and may not meet our financial guidance or published analyst forecasts 
this may cause the price of our common stock to decline significantly 
our future quarterly and annual operating results are subject to fluctuations due to a wide variety of factors  including the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry  shortages in foundry  assembly or test capacity  disruption in the supply of wafers  assembly or test services  declines in average selling prices of our products  changes in our product mix which could reduce our gross margins  decreases in the demand for our products  oversupply of memory products in the market  excess inventory levels at our customers  cancellation of existing orders or the failure to secure new orders  our failure to introduce new products and to implement technologies on a timely basis  market acceptance of ours and our customers products  economic slowness and low end user demand  our ability to obtain sufficient flash memory for use in our multi chip packages  our failure to anticipate changing customer product requirements  fluctuations in manufacturing yields at our suppliers  our failure to deliver products to customers on a timely basis  the timing of significant orders  increased expenses associated with new product introductions  masks or process changes  the ability of customers to make payments to us  and the commencement of  or developments with respect to  any litigation or future antidumping proceedings 

table of contents our sales depend on dram and sram products and reduced demand for these products or a decline in average selling prices could harm our business 
approximately of our net sales are derived from the sale of dram and sram products  which are subject to unit volume fluctuations and declines in average selling prices that could harm our business 
for example  in fiscal  we experienced sequential declines in revenue from million in our december quarter to million in our march quarter to million in our june quarter to million in our september quarter 
these declines were a result of a decrease in unit shipments of our products due to lower demand for electronic products that use our devices  as well as a decline in the average selling prices of such products 
we may not be able to offset any future price declines by higher volumes or by higher prices on newer products 
while we have recently experienced increases in average selling prices for some of our products  historically  average selling prices for semiconductor memory products have declined  and we expect that average selling prices will decline in the future 
our ability to maintain or increase revenues will depend upon our ability to increase unit sales volume of existing products and introduce and sell new products that compensate for the anticipated declines in the average selling prices of our existing products 
our gross margins may decline even in periods of increasing revenue 
our gross margin is affected by a variety of factors including our mix of products sold  average selling prices for our products and cost of wafers 
even when our revenues are increasing  our gross margin may be adversely affected if such increased revenue is from products with lower margins or declining average selling prices 
during periods of strong demand  wafer capacity is likely to be in short supply and we will likely have to pay higher prices for wafers which would adversely affect our gross margin unless we are able to increase our product prices to offset such costs 
to maintain our gross margins when average selling prices are declining  we must introduce new products with higher margins or reduce our cost per unit 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase unit sales volumes  introduce and sell new products or reduce our cost per unit 
we rely on third party contractors to assemble and test our products and our failure to successfully manage our relationships with these contractors could damage our relationships with our customers  decrease our sales and limit our growth 
we rely on third party contractors located in asia to assemble and test our products 
there are significant risks associated with our reliance on these third party contractors  including reduced control over product quality  potential price increases  reduced control over delivery schedules  capacity shortages  their inability to increase production and achieve acceptable yields on a timely basis  absence of long term agreements  limited warranties on products supplied to us  and general risks related to conducting business internationally 
if any of these risks are realized  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected until our subcontractor is able to remedy the problem or until we are able to secure an alternative subcontractor 

table of contents the loss of a significant customer or a reduction in orders from such a customer could adversely affect our operating results 
as sales to our customers are executed pursuant to purchase orders and no purchasing contracts typically exist  our customers can cease doing business with us at any time 
in fiscal  sales to atm electronic corporation  a distributor in taiwan  accounted for approximately of our total net sales 
a substantial portion of our sales to atm were for delivery to ambit 
in fiscal  sales to flextronics international accounted for approximately of our net sales 
substantially all of our sales to flextronics were for products to be delivered to cisco 
shipments for cisco directly  or indirectly through subcontractors  accounted for approximately of our net sales for fiscal shipments for com directly  or indirectly through subcontractors  accounted for approximately of our net sales for fiscal during fiscal  we experienced cancelled or reduced orders from some of our major customers that adversely impacted our operating results 
while we still do business  indirectly or directly  with both cisco and com  neither accounted for more than of our revenues in fiscal we may not be able to retain our key customers  such customers may cancel or reschedule orders  or in the event of canceled orders  such orders may not be replaced by other sales 
in addition  sales to any particular customer may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  and such fluctuating sales could harm our business and financial results 
we have significant international sales and operations and risks related to our international activities could harm our operating results 
in fiscal  approximately of our net sales was attributable to customers located in the us  was attributable to customers located in europe and was attributable to customers located in asia 
in fiscal  approximately of our net sales was attributable to customers located in the us  was attributable to customers located in europe and was attributable to customers located in asia 
in fiscal  approximately of our net sales was attributable to customers located in the us  was attributable to customers located in europe and was attributable to customers located in asia 
we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to represent a significant percentage of our net sales 
in addition  all of our wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors are in taiwan  china and singapore 
we are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  including global economic conditions  particularly in taiwan and china  travel or other restrictions related to public health issues such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars  duties  tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions  changes in trade policy and regulatory requirements  transportation delays  the burdens of complying with foreign laws  foreign currency fluctuations  imposition of foreign currency controls  language barriers  difficulties in hiring experienced engineers in countries such as china  difficulties in collecting foreign accounts receivable  political instability  including any changes in relations between china and taiwan  and earthquakes and other natural disasters 

table of contents we have implemented significant cost cutting measures  and we may be required to increase expenses in response to improving market conditions 
we implemented significant cost cutting measures during fiscal and fiscal in response to poor industry conditions 
these cost cutting efforts included reallocating personnel and responsibilities to countries with lower expense structures  reducing spending on research and development and capital expenditures  reducing our workforce  and instituting temporary office and facility shutdowns 
our cost cutting measures may have negatively impacted our efficiency and may not lead to profitability 
in addition  our reduction in research and development spending could harm our ability to introduce new products in the future 
if our business activity increases  our operating expenses will need to increase 
our revenues and business would be harmed if we are not able to successfully develop  introduce and sell new products and develop and implement new manufacturing technologies in a timely manner 
we operate in highly competitive  quickly changing markets which are characterized by rapid obsolescence of existing products 
as a result  our future success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products that our customers choose to buy in significant quantities 
if we fail to introduce new products in a timely manner or if our customers products do not achieve commercial success  our business and results of operations could be seriously harmed 
the design and introduction of new products is challenging as such products typically incorporate more functions and operate at faster speeds than prior products 
increasing complexity generally requires smaller features on a chip 
this makes developing new generations of products substantially more difficult than prior generations 
if we are unable to design  introduce  market and sell new products successfully  our business and financial results would be seriously harmed 
our products are complex and could contain defects  which could reduce sales of those products or result in claims against us 
we develop complex and evolving products 
despite testing by us and our customers  errors may be found in existing or new products 
this could result in a delay in recognition or loss of revenues  loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance 
these defects also may cause us to incur significant warranty  support and repair costs  may divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts  and could harm our relationships with our customers 
the occurrence of these problems could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and would likely harm our business 
defects  integration issues or other performance problems in our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers or could lessen market acceptance of our products 
our customers could also seek and obtain damages from us for their losses 
from time to time  we have been involved in disputes regarding product warranty issues and are presently involved in litigation with symbol technologies regarding a product dispute 
see business legal proceedings 
although we seek to limit our liability to replacement of defective items or return of amounts paid  a product liability claim brought against us  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming and could be costly to defend 
potential intellectual property claims and litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages and could invalidate our proprietary rights 
in the semiconductor industry  it is not unusual for companies to receive notices alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
we have been  and from time to time expect to be  notified of claims that we may be infringing patents  maskwork rights or copyrights owned by third parties 
if it appears 
table of contents necessary or desirable  we may seek licenses under patents that we are alleged to be infringing 
licenses may not be offered and the terms of any offered licenses may not be acceptable to us 
the failure to obtain a license under a key patent or intellectual property right from a third party for technology used by us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture of the products utilizing the invention or to attempt to develop non infringing products  any of which could harm our business 
furthermore  we may become involved in protracted litigation regarding the alleged infringement by us of third party intellectual property rights or litigation to assert and protect our patents or other intellectual property rights 
any litigation relating to patent infringement or other intellectual property matters could result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources  which could harm our business 
we may be unable to effectively protect our intellectual property  which would negatively impact our ability to compete 
we believe that the protection of our intellectual proprietary rights will continue to be important to the success of our business 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
we also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and business partners  and control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these efforts  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our technology is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the us many us companies have encountered substantial infringement problems in foreign countries  including countries in which we design and sell our products 
we do not currently hold any non us patents 
we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of our pending applications nor can we be certain that any issued patents would protect or benefit us or give us adequate protection from competing products 
for example  issued patents may be circumvented or challenged and declared invalid or unenforceable 
we also cannot be certain that others will not develop our unpatented proprietary technology or effective competing technologies on their own 
we have acquired equity positions for strategic reasons in other companies which may significantly decrease in value 
over the last few years  we have acquired equity positions for strategic reasons in other technology companies and we may make similar equity purchases in the future 
at september   our strategic investments in non marketable securities totaled million of which million was invested in smic 
these equity securities may not increase in value and there is the possibility that they could decrease in value over time  even to the point of becoming completely worthless 
these equity securities are tested for impairment on a recurring basis and any reductions in the carrying value would lower our profitability 
in this regard  we recorded approximately a million impairment loss on one of our equity positions in the three months ended june  in addition  we recorded approximately million and million in impairment losses during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our financial statements account for the results of our former subsidiary  icsi  on the equity basis and fluctuations in icsi s results will also impact our results 
we held approximately of the equity of our former wholly owned subsidiary  integrated circuit solution  inc  or icsi  at september  our financial results for fiscal and fiscal reflect accounting for icsi on the equity basis and include our percentage share of the results of icsi s operations 
as a result  our net income loss will be impacted by the financial results of icsi 
we have limited visibility as to the future financial results of icsi 
any unexpected fluctuations in icsi s results would have an unexpected impact on our net income which could be material to our financial results 
icsi s shares are publicly traded on the 
table of contents taiwan stock exchange and its share price is subject to market fluctuations 
a significant decline in the stock price of icsi may require us to record an impairment loss related to these shares 
we may encounter difficulties in effectively integrating acquired businesses 
from time to time  we may acquire other companies that we believe to be complementary to our business 
acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  amortization expenses related to intangible assets  and the possible impairment of goodwill  which could harm our profitability 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including higher than estimated acquisition expenses  difficulties in successfully assimilating the operations  technologies and personnel of the acquired company  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have no  or limited  direct prior experience  the risk that the markets for acquired products do not develop as expected  and the potential loss of key employees and customers as a result of the acquisition 
in this regard  in february  we acquired purple ray  a privately held research and development stage company developing network search engine and content addressable memory integrated circuits 
to date  we have not generated any revenue as a result of this acquisition and none is anticipated 
in addition  the transaction resulted in an in process technology charge of million in our march  quarter 
as of june   we had written off substantially all of the value of our acquisition of purple ray 
any future acquisitions may not contribute positively to our business or operating results 
we depend on our ability to attract and retain our key technical and management personnel 
our success depends upon the continued service of our key technical and management personnel  including jimmy sm lee  our chairman and chief executive officer  and gary l 
fischer  our president  chief operating officer  and chief financial officer 
several of our important manufacturing and other subcontractor relationships are based on personal relationships between our senior executive officers and such parties 
in particular  our chairman and chief executive officer has long term relationships with our key foundries 
if we were to lose the services of any key executives  it may negatively impact the related business relationships since we have no long term contractual agreements with such parties 
our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified technical personnel  particularly experienced circuit designers and process engineers 
the competition for such employees is intense 
we have no employment contracts or key person life insurance policies with or for any of our employees 
the loss of the service of one or more of our key personnel could harm our business 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations may increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july  as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission and the nasdaq stock market  have required  and will require  changes to some of our accounting and corporate governance practices  including a report on our internal controls as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of we expect these new rules and regulations to increase our accounting  legal and other costs  and to make some activities more difficult  time consuming and or costly 
we also expect these new rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these new rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and qualified members of our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee 

table of contents our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board  the american institute of certified public accountants  the securities and exchange commission and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in these policies or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results  and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change 
for example  while current accounting rules allow us to exclude the expense of stock options from our financial statements  influential business policy groups  including the financial accounting standards board  have suggested that the rules be changed to require these options to be expensed 
technology companies generally  and our company  specifically  rely on stock options as a major component of our employee compensation packages 
if we are required to expense options  we may be less likely to achieve profitability or we may have to decrease or eliminate options grants 
decreasing or eliminating option grants may negatively impact our ability to attract and retain qualified employees 
our stock price is expected to be volatile  and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is expected to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  general conditions or cyclicality in the semiconductor industry or the end markets that we serve  new or revised earnings estimates by us or industry analysts  comments or recommendations issued by analysts who follow us  our competitors or the semiconductor industry  aggregate valuations and movement of stocks in the broader semiconductor industry  announcements of new products  strategic relationships or acquisitions by us or our competitors  increases or decreases in available wafer capacity  governmental regulations  trade laws and import duties  announcements related to future or existing litigation involving us or any of our competitors  announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors  additions or departures of senior management  and other events or factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility in recent years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
for example  on october   our closing stock price was  rose to on june   and subsequently declined to on november  
table of contents risks related to our industry foundry capacity can be limited  and we may be required to enter into costly arrangements to secure foundry capacity 
if we are not able to obtain additional foundry capacity as required  our relationships with our customers would be harmed and our future sales would be adversely impacted 
in order to secure foundry capacity  we have entered into in the past  and may enter into in the future  various arrangements with suppliers  which could include purchases of equity or debt securities in foundries  joint ventures  process development relationships with foundries  contracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods  increased price for wafers  option payments or other prepayments to foundries  and nonrefundable deposits with  or loans to  foundries in exchange for capacity commitments 
we may not be able to make any such arrangements in a timely fashion or at all  and such arrangements  if any  may not be on terms favorable to us 
once we make commitments to secure foundry capacity  we may incur significant financial penalties if we subsequently determine that we are not able to utilize all of that capacity 
such penalties may be substantial and could harm our financial results 
our foundries may experience lower than expected yields which could adversely effect our business 
the manufacture of integrated circuits is a highly complex and technically demanding process 
production yields and device reliability can be affected by a large number of factors 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  our outside foundries have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields and device reliability problems  particularly in connection with the introduction of new products and changes in such foundry s processing steps 
there can be no assurance that our foundries will not experience lower than expected manufacturing yields or device reliability problems in the future  which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
any future downturn in the markets we serve would harm our business and financial results 
substantially all of our products are incorporated into products for the digital consumer electronics  networking  mobile communications and automotive electronics markets 
historically  these markets have experienced cyclical depressed business conditions  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  a decline in general economic conditions or due to adverse supply and demand conditions in such markets 
for example  our sales in the networking market declined significantly beginning in due to very depressed conditions in the overall networking and communications industry 
these adverse conditions continued in and and we are unable to predict when or if the networking market will recover 
industry downturns have resulted in reduced demand and declining average selling prices for our products which adversely affected our business 
we expect that industry downturns will occur again  but are unable to predict when any such downturn will occur or how long it will last 

table of contents shifts in industry wide capacity may cause our results to fluctuate 
these shifts may occur quickly with little or no advance notice 
in the past  such shifts have resulted in significant inventory write downs 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is subject to significant downturns resulting from excess capacity  overproduction  reduced demand or technological obsolescence 
shifts in industry wide capacity from shortages to oversupply or from oversupply to shortages may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results 
these shifts in industry conditions can occur quickly with little or no advance notice to us 
adverse changes in industry conditions are likely to result in a decline in average selling prices and the stated value of inventory 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we recorded inventory write downs of million  million and million  respectively 
the inventory write downs were predominately for lower of cost or market accounting on our products  and to a lesser extent  excess inventory 
we write down to zero carrying value of inventory on hand in excess of six months estimated sales volumes to cover estimated excess and obsolete exposures  unless adjustments are made to the forecast based on management s judgments for newer products  end of life products or planned inventory increases 
in making such judgments to write down inventory  management takes into account the product life cycles which can range from six to months  the stage in the life cycle of the product  the impact of competitors announcements and product introductions on our products 
we believe that six months is an appropriate period because it is difficult to accurately forecast for a specific product beyond this time frame due to the potential introduction of products by competitors  technology obsolescence or fluctuations in demand 
our policy regarding excess inventory resulted in inventory write downs for excess inventory of approximately million for fiscal and million for fiscal future additional inventory write downs may occur due to lower of cost or market accounting  excess inventory or inventory obsolescence 
strong competition in the semiconductor memory market may harm our business 
the semiconductor memory market is intensely competitive and has been characterized by an oversupply of product  price erosion  rapid technological change  short product life cycles  cyclical market patterns  and heightened foreign and domestic competition 
many of our competitors offer broader product lines and have greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources than us 
in particular  a competitor with a materially smaller die size and lower cost could dramatically gain market share in a short period of time 
we may not be able to compete successfully against any of these competitors 
our ability to compete successfully in the memory market depends on factors both within and outside of our control  including the pricing of our products  the supply and cost of wafers  product design  functionality  performance and reliability  successful and timely product development  the performance of our competitors and their pricing policies  wafer manufacturing over or under capacity  real or perceived imbalances in supply and demand for our products  the rate at which oem customers incorporate our products into their systems  the success of our customers products and end user demand  access to advanced process technologies at competitive prices  achievement of acceptable yields of functional die  the capacity of our third party contractors to assemble and test our products  
table of contents the gain or loss of significant customers  and the nature of our competitors and general economic conditions 
in addition  we are vulnerable to technology advances utilized by competitors to manufacture higher performance or lower cost products 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future as to any of these factors 
our failure to compete successfully in these or other areas could harm our business and financial results 
terrorist attacks  threats of further attacks  acts of war and threats of war may negatively impact all aspects of our operations  revenues  costs and stock price 
the september terrorist attacks in the us  as well as future events occurring in response or connection to them  including future terrorist attacks against us targets  rumors or threats of war  actual conflicts involving the us or its allies such as the war in iraq  conflict between china and taiwan  or trade disruptions impacting our domestic or foreign suppliers or our customers  may impact our operations and may  among other things  cause delays or losses in the delivery of wafers or other products to us and decreased sales of our products 
more generally  these events have affected  and are expected to continue to affect  the general economy and customer demand for products sold by our customers 
any of these occurrences could have a significant impact on our operating results  revenues and costs  which in turn may result in increased volatility in our common stock price and a decline in the price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial market risk includes risks associated with international operations and related foreign currencies 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our consolidated revenue 
our international sales are largely denominated in us dollars and therefore are not subject to material foreign currency exchange risk 
we have operations in china  europe  taiwan  hong kong  india and korea 
expenses of our international operations are denominated in each country s local currency and therefore are subject to foreign currency exchange risk  however  through september  we have not experienced any significant negative impact on our operations as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not currently engage in any hedging activities 
we had short term investments of million at september  the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without increasing risk 
we invest primarily in high quality  short term debt instruments such as municipal auction rate certificates and instruments issued by high quality financial institutions and companies  including money market instruments 
a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates would result in approximately a million decrease in our interest income 
we own approximately of icsi  a public company listed on the taiwan stock exchange 
we account for this investment on the equity basis and our total carrying value of this investment as of september  was approximately million of which million is included in other assets and million is included in other comprehensive loss in the equity portion of our balance sheet 
the market value of our investment in the common stock of icsi at september  was approximately million  based on quoted market prices 
the share price of icsi is subject to fluctuations 
a significant decline in the stock price of icsi may require us to record a loss related to this investment 
in addition  we own approximately million of icsi convertible debentures 
as a result of a decline in icsi s convertible debenture price  we recorded an unrealized loss of approximately  related to the icsi convertible debentures 
this loss was included in other comprehensive loss in the equity portion of our balance sheet 
in addition  in fiscal  we recorded a charge of approximately million related to the decline in the fair value of an embedded derivative associated with the icsi convertible debenture 
the charge associated with the embedded derivative is included in other income expense 
any future decline in icsi s debenture price would result in additional losses 

table of contents we have investments in equity securities of privately held companies for the promotion of business and strategic objectives of approximately million at september   of which million is invested in smic 
these investments are generally in companies in the semiconductor industry 
these investments are included in other assets and are accounted for using the cost method 
for investments in which no public market exists  our policy is to review the operating performance  recent financing transactions and cash flow forecasts for such companies in assessing the net realizable values of the securities of these companies 
impairment losses on equity investments are recorded when events and circumstances indicate that such assets are impaired and the decline in value is other than temporary 
in this regard  we recorded approximately a million impairment loss on our investment in signia technologies in the three months ended june  in addition  we recorded approximately million in impairment losses during fiscal
