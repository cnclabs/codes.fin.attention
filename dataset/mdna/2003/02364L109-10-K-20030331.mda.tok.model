item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements provided under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to revenue and cost recognition  loss contracts  professional and general liability insurance  legal contingencies  impairment of goodwill  amortization and impairment of contracts and other intangibles  and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies are affected by the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue and cost recognition the company s contracts with correctional institutions are principally fixed price contracts adjusted for census fluctuations 
such contracts typically have a term of one to three years with subsequent renewal options 
the contracts may also contain certain risk sharing arrangements  such as stop loss provisions and aggregate limits for off site or pharmaceutical costs 
revenues earned under contracts with correctional institutions are recognized in the period that services are rendered 
cash received in advance for future services is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income when the service is performed 
revenues are calculated based on the specific contract terms and fall into one of three general categories fixed fee  population based  or cost plus a margin 
for fixed fee contracts  revenues are recorded based on fixed monthly amounts established in the service contract 
revenue for population based contracts is calculated either as a fixed fee adjusted using a per diem rate for variances in the inmate population from predetermined population levels or by a per diem rate times the average inmate population for the period of service 
for cost plus contracts  revenues are calculated based on actual expenses incurred during the service period plus a contractual margin 
under all contracts  the company records revenues net of any estimated contractual allowances for potential adjustments resulting from performance or staffing related criteria  as well as the impact of any risk sharing arrangements  on an accrual basis in the period the services are provided 
if necessary  the company revises its estimates for such adjustments in future periods when the actual amount of the adjustment is determined 
revenues for the distribution of pharmaceutical and medical supplies are recognized upon delivery of the related products 
healthcare expenses include the compensation of physicians  nurses and other healthcare professionals including any related benefits and all other direct costs of providing the managed care 
the cost of healthcare services provided or contracted for are recognized in the period in which they are provided based in part on estimates  including an accrual for unbilled medical services rendered through the balance sheet date 
the company estimates the accrual for unbilled medical services using an actuarial analysis 
table of contents prepared monthly by an independent actuary 
the analysis takes into account historical claims experience including the average historical costs and billing lag time for such services and other actuarial data 
actual payments and future reserve requirements will differ from the company s current estimates 
the differences could be material if significant adverse fluctuations occur in the healthcare cost structure or the company s future claims experience 
changes in estimates of claims resulting from such fluctuations and differences between actuarial estimates and actual claims payments are recognized in the period in which the estimates are changed or the payments are made 
loss contracts the company accrues losses under its fixed price contracts when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company performs this loss accrual analysis on a specific contract basis taking into consideration such factors as future contractual revenue  projected future healthcare and maintenance costs  projected future stop loss insurance recoveries and each contract s specific terms related to future revenue increases as compared to increased healthcare costs 
the projected future healthcare and maintenance costs are estimated based on historical trends and management s estimate of future cost increases 
these estimates are subject to the same adverse fluctuations and future claims experience as previously noted 
some of the company s contracts provide for annual increases in the fixed base fee upon changes in the regional medical care component of the consumer price index  while others contain fixed increases 
the company performs a periodic comprehensive review of its portfolio of contracts for the purpose of identifying loss contracts and developing a contract loss reserve for succeeding periods 
as a result of its review  the company identified five non cancelable contracts with combined annual revenues of million and negative gross margin of million 
based upon management s projections  these contracts were expected to continue to incur negative gross margin over their remaining terms 
in december  the company recorded a charge of million to establish a reserve for future losses under these non cancelable contracts 
the five contracts covered by the charge had expiration dates ranging from june  through june  ninety percent of the charge related to the state of kansas contract  which expires june   and the city of philadelphia contract  which was renewable annually  at the client s option  through june  the remaining ten percent of the charge related to the state of maine contract  which was due to expire june   a county contract that expires on june  and a county contract that renewed on more favorable terms on august  negative gross margin and overhead costs charged against the loss contract reserve related to these five contracts totaled million for the year ended december  in june  the company and the city of philadelphia reached a mutual agreement that the contract between phs and the city of philadelphia would expire effective june  as a result of the earlier than anticipated expiration of this loss contract  the company performed a reassessment of its loss contract reserve requirements 
this reassessment included a review of management s projected future losses under the remaining three loss contracts as well as a comprehensive review of the company s portfolio of contracts at june  for the purpose of identifying any additional loss contracts 
no new loss contracts were identified as a result of this review 
based upon the reassessment  the company recorded a gain of million  in the second quarter of  to reduce its reserve for loss contracts 
the company will continue to provide services to the state of maine under a cost plus a fixed management fee transition agreement through march  the company also entered into a transition arrangement with the city of philadelphia under which it continued to provide services through september  under modified contract terms 
on september   the company and the city of philadelphia entered into a new contract amendment under which the company will continue to provide healthcare services to the city of philadelphia  under modified contract terms  through june  as of december   the company has a loss contract reserve totaling million which relates to two remaining loss contracts  the state of kansas and a county contract  both of which expire on june  professional and general liability insurance as a healthcare provider  the company is subject to medical malpractice claims and lawsuits 
the most significant source of potential liability in this regard is the risk of suits brought by inmates alleging lack of timely or adequate healthcare services 
the company may also be liable  as employer  for the negligence of healthcare professionals it employs or the healthcare professionals it engages as independent contractors 
the company s contracts generally require it to indemnify the governmental agency for losses incurred related to healthcare provided by the company or its agents 
to mitigate a portion of this risk  the company maintains professional liability insurance on a claims made basis and assumes certain self insurance risks resulting from the use of large deductibles in and and the use of an adjustable premium policy in for  the company was covered by a policy with a month retro premium with adjustment based on actual losses after months 
the company s final premium for will depend on the ultimate losses incurred 
reserves for estimated losses are provided for on an undiscounted basis in the period of the related coverage based on an independent actuarial analysis 
these reserves are monitored for adequacy on a quarterly basis using internal and external evaluations of the merits of the individual claims  analysis of claim history and the estimated reserves assigned by the company s third party administrator 
any adjustments resulting from the review are reflected in current earnings 
in addition to its reserves for known claims  the company maintains a reserve for incurred but not reported claims 
the reserve for incurred but not reported claims is recorded on an undiscounted basis 
the company s estimates of this reserve are supported by an independent actuarial analysis which is obtained on a quarterly basis 
reserves for medical malpractice liability fluctuate because the number of claims and the severity of the underlying incidents change from one period to the next 
furthermore  payments with respect to previously estimated liabilities frequently differ from the estimated liability 
changes in estimates of losses resulting from such fluctuations and differences between actuarial estimates and actual loss payments are recognized by an adjustment to the reserve for medical malpractice liability in the period in which the estimates are changed or payments are made 
the reserves can also be affected by changes in the financial health of the third party insurance carriers used by the company 
changes in reserve requirements resulting from a change in the financial health of a third party insurance carrier are recognized in the period in which such factor becomes known 

table of contents legal contingencies in addition to professional and general liability claims  the company is also subject to other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business 
such proceedings generally relate to labor  employment or contract matters 
the company accrues an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate is developed in consultation with outside counsel handling the company s defense in these matters and is based upon an estimated range of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
the company does not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position 
however  it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions  new developments or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with such litigation 
impairment of goodwill the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on january   at which time it ceased amortization of goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill acquired is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
important factors taken into consideration when evaluating the need for an impairment review include the following significant underperformance or loss of key contracts acquired in an acquisition relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the company s acquired assets or in the company s overall business strategy  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when the company determines that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment or as a result of its annual impairment review  any impairment is measured using a fair value based goodwill impairment test as required under the provisions of sfas no 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenues performance measures 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
based on the results of its annual review for  management has determined that goodwill is not impaired as of december  future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with its acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
amortization and impairment of contract and other intangibles the company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its contract and other intangibles when events and circumstances warrant  generally in conjunction with the annual business planning cycle 
if the carrying value of the evaluated asset is considered impaired  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market 
fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
the company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its contract intangibles on at least a quarterly basis  taking into account new facts and circumstances  including its retention rate for acquired contracts 
if such facts and circumstances indicate the current estimated life is no longer reasonable  the company adjusts the estimated useful life on a prospective basis 
in the third 
table of contents quarter of  the company revised the estimated life of the contract intangibles  acquired in its acquisition of emsa  from years to years 
the revised life impacted contract intangibles with a gross value of million and resulted in an increase to amortization of  or per fully diluted share  for the year ended december  on a prospective basis the revised life will result in an increase to annual amortization expense of  income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method of sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into consideration such factors as historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
sfas no 
requires the company to record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
it further states forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
at december  and  a valuation allowance has been recorded equal to the deferred tax assets after considering deferred tax assets that can be realized through offsets to existing taxable temporary differences 
assuming the company achieves sufficient profitability in future years to realize the deferred income tax assets  the valuation allowance will be reduced in future years through a credit to income tax expense increasing shareholders equity 
due to the company s net income in  the company s deferred tax valuation allowance was reduced million from million at december  to million at december   as a reduction to the company s income tax provision
