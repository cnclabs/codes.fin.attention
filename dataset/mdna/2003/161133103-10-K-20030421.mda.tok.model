item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
as used in this report  the terms fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal refer to our fiscal years ended february   february   and february   respectively 
fiscal and fiscal consisted of weeks  while fiscal consisted of weeks 
the term fiscal refers to our fiscal year which will end on january  forward looking statements with the exception of historical information  the matters contained in the following analysis and elsewhere in this report are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements may include  but are not limited to  projections of revenues  income or loss  capital expenditures and cost reductions  plans for future operations  and financing needs or plans  as well as assumptions relating to the foregoing 
the words expect  project  estimate  predict  anticipate  plan  believes  and similar expressions are also intended to identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties  some of which cannot be predicted or quantified 
future events and actual results  performance  and achievements could differ materially from those set forth in  contemplated by  or underlying the forward looking statements 
we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect actual results or changes in  or additions to  the factors affecting such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause our actual results of operations or financial condition to differ from those described in this report include  but are not necessarily limited to  the following o our business is dependent upon our being able to accurately predict rapidly changing fashion trends  customer preferences and other fashion related factors  which we may not be able to successfully accomplish in the future 
o the general slowdown in the united states economy and the uncertain economic outlook has led to reduced consumer demand for our apparel and accessories and may continue to do so in the future 
o the women s specialty retail apparel industry is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully against existing or future competitors 
o we cannot assure the successful implementation of our business plan for increased profitability and growth in our plus sized women s apparel business 
o our business plan is largely dependent upon the continued growth in the plus sized women s apparel market which may not continue 
o we depend on key personnel  particularly our chief executive officer  dorrit j 
bern  and we may not be able to retain or replace these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel 
o we depend on our distribution centers and could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our stores if any of these distribution centers were to shut down for any reason 
o we depend for our working capital needs on the availability of credit  including credit we receive from our suppliers and their agents  and on our credit card securitization program 
if we were unable to obtain sufficient financing at affordable cost  our ability to merchandise our stores would be adversely affected 
o we rely significantly on foreign sources of production and face a variety of risks including political instability  imposition of duties or quotas  increased security requirements applicable to imports  delays in shipping  increased costs of transportation  and issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad 
o our stores experience seasonal fluctuations in net sales and operating income 
any decrease in sales or margins during our peak sales periods  or in the availability of working capital needed in the months preceding such periods  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  extreme or unseasonable weather conditions may have an impact on our sales 
o war  acts of terrorism  or the threat of either may negatively impact availability of merchandise and customer traffic to our stores  or otherwise adversely affect our business 
o we may be unable to obtain adequate insurance for our operations at a reasonable cost 
o we may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights  which we believe are important to our success and our competitive position 
o we may be unable to hire and retain suitable sales associates at our stores 
o we may be unable to successfully implement our cost reduction plan described elsewhere in this report 
o our manufacturers may be unable to manufacture and deliver merchandise to us in a timely manner or to meet our quality standards 
o our sales are dependent upon a high volume of traffic in the strip centers and malls in which our stores are located  and our future growth is dependent upon the availability of suitable locations for new stores 
o we may be unable to successfully integrate lane bryant into our current operating structure  or implement our plan to re establish growth and improve merchandise assortments in our lane bryant stores  and we currently rely on logistics services from limited brands  inc limited brands with respect to our lane bryant stores 
critical accounting policies we have prepared the financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
this requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience  analysis of current trends  and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we periodically reevaluate our accounting policies  assumptions  and estimates and make adjustments when facts and circumstances warrant 
historically  actual results have not differed materially from those determined using required estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes accompanying the financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
however  we consider the following accounting policies to be more critical to  and involve the most significant management judgments and estimates in  the preparation of our financial statements and accompanying notes 
revenue recognition our revenues from merchandise sales are net of returns and allowances and exclude sales tax 
we have adopted securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  effective as of the beginning of fiscal as a result of adoption of sab  we established a reserve for estimated future sales returns based on an analysis of actual returns and we began deferring recognition of layaway sales to the date of delivery 
a change in our actual rates of sales returns and layaway sales experience would affect the level of revenue recognized 
in fiscal  we began a customer loyalty card program for our fashion bug store customers 
the program provides discounts on customer purchases over a twelve month period upon payment of a annual fee 
revenues from card fees under the program are recognized as sales over the life of the membership as discounts are earned by the customer 
if a customer does not earn discounts in an amount that exceeds the card fee  such difference is recognized as revenue upon the expiration of the annual period 
upon early cancellation of a loyalty card  refunds of membership fees are reduced by the amount of any discounts granted to the member under the program 
we recognize our costs of administering the program in cost of goods sold as incurred 
revenues recognized from card fees offset discounts granted under the program 
an increase in the level of refunds of membership fees could impact the level of revenue recognized 
as of december   we discontinued the issuance of new cards under this program and will introduce a new customer loyalty card program during fiscal that will be operated under our proprietary credit card program 
inventories we value our merchandise inventories at the lower of cost or market under the retail inventory method average cost basis  which is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry 
under the retail inventory method rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are adjusted in proportion to markdowns and shrinkage on our retail inventories 
the use of the rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
the rim calculation involves certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  merchandise markon  markup  markdowns  and shrinkage  which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as resulting gross margins 
events such as store closings  liquidations  and the general economic environment for retail apparel sales could result in an increase in the level of markdowns  which under the rim could result in lower inventory values and increases to cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales in future periods 
in addition  failure to properly estimate markdowns currently can result in an overstatement of inventory cost under the lower of cost or market principle 
at the end of fiscal  for purposes of valuing our inventory  we recognized markdowns that had not been taken and which reduced inventories by approximately million 
in connection with our restructuring plan announced on january  see results of operations restructuring charge credit below  we recognized additional markdowns of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the markdowns were related to the valuation of inventory for stores that we closed during the first half of fiscal we elected to adopt the provisions of fasb eitf issue see accounting for cash consideration received from a vendor below as of the beginning of fiscal as of february   million of cash received from vendors has been deferred into inventory and will be recognized as inventory is sold 
impairment of long lived assets prior to fiscal  we evaluated the recoverability of our long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions related to the disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas no 
also resolved certain implementation issues related to sfas no 
sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions of sfas no 
related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and provides additional guidance on estimating cash flows when testing for recoverability 
sfas no 
also requires that long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale such as by abandonment be classified as held and used until disposal  and establishes more restrictive criteria for classifying assets as held for sale 
under sfas no 
 we are required to assess our long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
we consider historical performance and future estimated results in our evaluation of potential impairment and then compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  we write down the asset to its estimated fair value and recognize an impairment loss 
our estimate of fair value is generally based on either appraised value or the present value of future cash flows  based on a number of assumptions and estimates 
during fiscal  we recorded a million write down of under performing assets related to our joint venture in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
the amount of the write down is the same as what would have been recorded under sfas no 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations in fiscal in connection with our restructuring plan announced on january  see results of operations restructuring charge credit below  we recognized a write down of store fixed assets of approximately million during fiscal in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions used in determining these impairment charges are reasonable and appropriate 
we fully adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets as of the beginning of fiscal in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas no 
 we performed a review of our goodwill and other intangible assets for possible impairment 
as a result  we determined that the carrying value of goodwill related to our catherine s acquisition including the value of intangible assets we did not separately account for at the date of the catherine s acquisition exceeded the estimated fair value of the catherine s goodwill under sfas no 
we determined the estimated fair value of the catherine s goodwill using the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the catherine s assets  and we recorded a write down  which is not deductible for income tax purposes  of million to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to its estimated fair value 
the majority of the write down is attributable to the value of unrecorded trademarks 
we also evaluated our goodwill  trademarks  tradenames  and internet domain names related to our lane bryant acquisition as of february  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 and determined that there has been no impairment of these assets 
the write down of the catherine s goodwill has been presented as the cumulative effect of an accounting change as of february  in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss for fiscal the calculation of the estimated fair value of the goodwill and other intangible assets required estimates  assumptions  and judgments  and results might have been materially different if different estimates  assumptions  and judgments had been used 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we are required to re evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets at least annually  or more frequently if there is an indication of possible impairment 
we performed this annual review during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and determined that there has been no additional impairment of these assets 
acquisitions purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  we allocate the cost of acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we assign to all identifiable assets acquired including intangible assets  and to all identifiable liabilities assumed  a portion of the cost of the acquired company equal to the estimated fair value of such assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition 
we record the excess of the cost of the acquired company over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed as goodwill 
we make the initial purchase price allocation based on the evaluation of information and estimates available at the date of the financial statements 
as final information regarding the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is evaluated and estimates are refined  we make appropriate adjustments to the amounts allocated to those assets and liabilities and make corresponding changes to the amounts allocated to goodwill 
we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and  for major business acquisitions  typically engage an outside appraisal firm to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long lived assets 
we have  if necessary  up to one year after the closing date of an acquisition to finish these fair value determinations and finalize the purchase price allocation 
in connection with the acquisition of lane bryant on august   we recorded a liability of million for estimated costs related to an unfavorable service contract 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we revised our estimate of costs related to the contract to million  which resulted in a decrease in the goodwill recognized in connection with our lane bryant acquisition of million  net of deferred income taxes of million 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a liability for severance in accordance with an agreement entered into with an affiliate of limited brands at the time of the acquisition to use the existing lane bryant distribution center and receive related distribution services on a transition basis  which resulted in an increase in lane bryant goodwill of million  net of deferred income taxes of million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we reduced the acquisition value assigned to equipment and leasehold improvements in the existing lane bryant distribution center  which will be abandoned at the end of the transition period as a result of our acquisition of a replacement distribution center in white marsh  maryland 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we also increased a liability for future claims related to lane bryant s pre acquisition operations and decreased deferred tax assets as a result of a correction of the effective tax rate used to determine deferred taxes related to certain assets acquired 
these third quarter adjustments resulted in an increase in lane bryant goodwill of million  including net deferred income taxes of million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we finalized the unfavorable service contract and other liabilities  which resulted in a decrease in lane bryant goodwill of million  net of deferred income taxes of million 
asset securitization we use an asset securitization program to fund the credit card receivables generated by our fashion bug credit card program 
the fashion bug credit cards are issued by spirit of america national bank  one of our subsidiaries 
asset securitization is a practice commonly used in the retail industry which allows companies with proprietary credit card programs to finance credit card receivables at attractive rates 
asset securitization involves the sale of the bank s fashion bug proprietary credit card receivables to a special purpose entity  which in turn transfers the receivables to a qualified special purpose entity the trust which is administered by an independent trustee 
because the trust qualifies as a qualifying special purpose entity qspe  its assets and liabilities are not consolidated in our balance sheet 
the trust issues to investors various forms of certificates or credit card receivable interests the certificates that represent interests in the underlying trust assets 
the trust pays to the holders of certificates a portion of future scheduled cash flows under preset terms and conditions  the receipt of which is dependent upon cash flows generated by the underlying performance of the trust assets 
in each securitization transaction  we retain certain subordinated interests  which effectively serve as a form of credit enhancement to the certificates sold to outside investors 
to the extent amounts remain available after repayment to the outside investors  the amounts are paid to us 
neither the investors nor the trust have recourse against us beyond the combination of trust assets and our subordinated interests  other than for breaches of certain customary representations  warranties and covenants 
these representations  warranties  covenants  and related indemnities do not protect the trust or the outside investors against credit related losses on the receivables 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  we record an interest in the estimated present value of cash flows to be received by us over the expected outstanding period of the receivables 
these cash flows essentially represent finance charges and late fees in excess of the amounts paid to certificate holders  credit losses  and service fees  and are referred to as the interest only strip i o strip 
we use certain valuation assumptions related to the average lives of the receivables sold and anticipated credit losses  as well as the appropriate market discount rate  in determining the estimated present value of the i o strip 
changes in the average life of the receivables sold  discount rate  and credit loss percentage could adversely impact the actual value of the i o strip 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from the estimates  and changes in circumstances could result in significant future changes to the assumptions currently being used 
costs associated with exit or disposal activities we have traditionally recognized certain costs associated with restructuring plans as of the date of commitment to the plan  in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which nullified eitf issue no 
under sfas no 
 for disposal activities initiated after december  we are required to recognize liabilities for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liabilities are incurred 
our commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create an obligation that meets the definition of a liability 
under sfas no 
 we would be required to recognize severance pay over time rather than up front if the benefit arrangement requires employees to render future service beyond a minimum retention period 
the liability for severance pay would be recognized as employees render service over the future service period  even if the benefit formula used to calculate an employee s termination benefit is based on length of service 
fair value should be used for initial measurement of liabilities under sfas no 
adoption of sfas no 
could result in the deferral of recognition of certain costs for restructuring plans that we initiate subsequent to december  from the date we commit to such a plan to the date that costs are incurred under the plan 
on march   we announced the implementation of a cost reduction plan see recent developments below 
costs incurred in connection with the implementation of this plan will be accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for cash consideration received from a vendor eitf issue  accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor  addresses the accounting for cash consideration received from a vendor  including both a reseller of the vendor s products and an entity that purchases the vendor s products from a reseller 
we elected to adopt the provisions of eitf issue no 
as of the beginning of fiscal we recognized a charge of million  net of income taxes of million  that represents the cumulative effect of the deferral of cash received from vendors as of the beginning of fiscal the impact of the adoption of eitf on the year ended february  was an increase in cost of goods sold of million 
as of february   million of cash received from vendors has been deferred into inventory and will be recognized as a reduction of cost of goods sold as inventory is sold 
stock based compensation sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  allows two alternatives for accounting for stock based compensation the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or the fair value method in accordance with sfas no 
companies electing to adopt the intrinsic value method are required to provide pro forma disclosures of the effect of adopting the fair value method 
we account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method 
we recognize compensation expense for stock options and stock awards which have an exercise price less than the market price of our common stock at the date of grant of the option or award 
we measure compensation expense based on the difference between the market price and the exercise price of an option or award at the date of grant 
this compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of each option or award 
we do not recognize compensation expense for options having an exercise price equal to the market price on the date of grant or for shares purchased under our employee stock purchase plan 
under the fair value method  we would be required to recognize compensation expense for all stock options and stock awards 
compensation would be measured based on an estimated fair value of the option or award  using an option pricing model  such as the black scholes or binomial pricing model 
these models require estimates or assumptions as to the dividend yield and price volatility of the underlying stock  the expected life of the option or award  and a relevant risk free interest rate 
under the fair value method  our after tax compensation expense would have increased by million 
per diluted share  million 
per diluted share  and million 
per diluted share for fiscal   and  respectively 
for purposes of determining these amounts  we used the black scholes option pricing model and various assumptions which are detailed in item financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements note summary of significant accounting policies common stock plans below 
the effect of using the fair value method for determining stock based compensation expense might have been materially different if different estimates  assumptions  and judgments had been used

comparable store sales for lane bryant are based on historical data  giving effect to our acquisition of lane bryant as if it had occurred on february  results may not be equivalent to the change in total sales 
includes sales of added dimensions stores  which have been closed or converted to catherine s stores 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal net sales net sales were  million in fiscal  an increase of from  million in fiscal  primarily due to our acquisition of lane bryant in august the number of retail stores in operation at the end of fiscal was  compared to  at the end of fiscal for details regarding store activity  see the table included in financial condition liquidity and capital resources below 
had we acquired lane bryant as of the beginning of fiscal  we would have experienced an overall comparable store sales decrease of from fiscal lane bryant stores had comparable store sales decreases in sweaters  denim  and intimate apparel 
in particular  the lane bryant chain experienced poor customer acceptance of  and fit and quality issues with  certain of its products during the second half of fiscal  resulting in higher levels of promotional pricing 
in addition  certain basic products were under stocked  resulting in missed sales opportunities 
due to product lead times  these issues are expected to negatively impact lane bryant results for the fiscal first quarter  and could negatively impact lane bryant results for the fiscal second quarter 
we are currently executing a plan to re establish growth at lane bryant which includes improved merchandise assortments for the fall season 
for fashion bug stores  comparable store sales increases in junior and plus sportswear  footwear  intimate apparel  and accessories were offset by declines in other missy sportswear  dresses  and coats 
for catherine s stores  comparable store sales increases in casual sportswear were offset by declines in other merchandise categories 
during fiscal  we discontinued the added dimensions chain  closed the remaining stores in the chain  and liquidated the remaining added dimensions store inventory 
we continue to be affected by a weak economy and an uncertain geopolitical climate 
during the first two months of fiscal  we experienced a decrease in lane bryant comparative store sales and a decrease in overall comparative store sales 
in fiscal  we began a customer loyalty card program for our fashion bug store customers see critical accounting policies revenue recognition above 
we recognized million of revenues in fiscal and million of revenues in fiscal in connection with this program 
we offset revenues recognized from card fees by discounts granted under the program 
as of december  we discontinued the issuance of new cards under this program and will introduce a new customer loyalty card program during fiscal that will be operated under our proprietary credit card program 
cost of goods sold  buying  and occupancy cost of goods sold  buying  and occupancy expenses were  million in fiscal  an increase of from  million in fiscal  principally reflecting the increase in net sales 
as a percentage of net sales  these costs decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the higher merchandise margins reflected improved inventory management in the fashion bug and catherine s chains and benefits from our restructuring plan see restructuring charge credit below  partially offset by declining margins in the lane bryant chain 
markdowns taken in connection with liquidation of added dimensions inventories during fiscal were offset by million of costs accrued at the end of fiscal related to the valuation of inventory for stores to be closed as the result of our restructuring plan 
merchandise margins for fiscal were negatively impacted by higher levels of promotional activity during the second half of the fiscal year as a result of a generally sluggish christmas holiday season and poor customer acceptance of certain lane bryant products  as discussed above 
cost of goods sold includes merchandise costs  net of discounts and allowances  freight  and inventory shrinkage 
net merchandise costs and freight are capitalized as inventory costs 
buying and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in buying and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the lack of leverage on relatively fixed occupancy costs as a result of negative comparable store sales 
occupancy expenses for fiscal  as a percentage of net sales  increased from fiscal relatively higher occupancy expenses for the lane bryant stores and a million write down of under performing assets related to our joint venture see recent developments below contributed to the increase in occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales 
buying expenses for fiscal  as a percentage of net sales  increased from fiscal buying expenses include payroll  payroll related costs  and operating expenses for our buying departments and warehouses 
occupancy expenses include rent  real estate taxes  insurance  common area maintenance  utilities  maintenance  and depreciation for our stores and warehouse facilities and equipment 
buying and occupancy costs are treated as period costs and are not capitalized as part of inventory 
selling  general  and administrative selling  general  and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of from million in fiscal  principally reflecting the acquisition of lane bryant 
as a percentage of net sales  these costs increased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal selling expenses increased as a percentage of net sales 
the increase was attributable to a number of factors  including higher store payroll and benefit costs  new point of sales systems at fashion bug  and an increase in direct marketing expenses in the catherine s and lane bryant chains 
general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales in fiscal  primarily as a result of increased employee benefit costs  costs associated with transitional service agreements related to the lane bryant acquisition  and the lack of leverage on fixed costs  particularly at lane bryant 
during fiscal  we completed the integration of lane bryant s information systems  which we expect will result in future cost synergies for the company 
restructuring charge credit on january   we announced a restructuring plan  including a number of initiatives designed to position us for increased profitability and growth in the women s plus size apparel business 
the major components of the plan included the closing of the answer added dimensions chain of stores  including the conversion of approximately of the added dimensions stores to catherine s stores  the closing of under performing fashion bug stores  and the conversion of fashion bug store locations to lane bryant stores 
the restructuring plan resulted in a pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the restructuring charge included a million non cash write down of fixed assets primarily store fixtures and improvements in the stores to be closed  million of anticipated payments to landlords for the early termination of existing store leases  thousand for severance costs  and thousand for sign removal and other costs 
during fiscal  we completed the restructuring plan  and we recognized a pre tax restructuring credit of million 
the restructuring credit was primarily a result of our ability to negotiate lease terminations on terms more favorable than our original estimates 
because a majority of the store closings occurred during the second half of fiscal  the full benefit of the restructuring plan will not occur until fiscal amortization of goodwill we recognized million of amortization of goodwill during fiscal related to our catherine s acquisition 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
as of february   and we are no longer amortizing the catherine s goodwill 
however  the catherine s goodwill and goodwill related to our acquisition of lane bryant are subject to periodic impairment reviews in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
see critical accounting policies impairment of long lived assets above and cumulative effect of accounting changes below 
other income other income was million in fiscal  a decrease of from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily caused by a decrease in interest income 
interest income decreased as a result of a decrease in the average yield on investments during fiscal as compared to fiscal interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal  an increase of from million in fiscal this increase was primarily a result of amortization of fees related to our credit facility  and to a lesser extent  a result of additional long term mortgage borrowings and acquisitions of point of sale equipment under long term capital leases 
in addition  a write off of thousand of unamortized deferred financing costs related to our million term loan  which was repaid during the period see financing below  resulted in additional interest expense in fiscal these increases were partially offset by reduced interest expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of relatively lower interest rates on borrowings and reduced levels of borrowings 
during fiscal  we converted or redeemed million of convertible subordinated notes due  repaid a million term loan  and issued million of senior convertible notes due see financing below 
income tax provision the income tax provision for fiscal was million  resulting in a effective tax rate  as compared to an income tax benefit for fiscal of thousand  resulting in a effective tax rate 
the unusual fiscal effective tax rate was a result of the effect of a million provision related to one of our employee insurance programs on a relatively small pre tax loss 
cumulative effect of accounting changes we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in full as of february  in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas no 
 we tested goodwill related to our catherine s acquisition for impairment during fiscal  and recorded a write down of million to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to its estimated fair value 
we also elected to adopt the provisions of eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor as of the beginning of fiscal the cumulative effect at the beginning of fiscal from deferring the recognition of cash received from vendors was a charge of million  net of income taxes of million

for fashion bug stores  improvements in junior sportswear were offset by declines in other merchandise categories 
in january  we announced plans to support growth in plus size apparel  and eliminated girls apparel from fashion bug stores effective at the end of the winter season 
sales of fashion bug girls apparel were approximately million during fiscal for catherine s stores  an increase in fiscal sales of casual sportswear was offset by declines in other merchandise categories 
in fiscal  we began a customer loyalty card program for our fashion bug store customers see critical accounting policies revenue recognition above 
we recognized million of revenues from card fees in connection with this program in fiscal cost of goods sold  buying  and occupancy cost of goods sold  buying  and occupancy expenses were  million in fiscal  an increase of from  million in fiscal  principally reflecting the increase in net sales

net merchandise costs and freight are capitalized as inventory costs 
buying and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in buying and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the lack of leverage on relatively fixed occupancy costs as a result of the decline in comparable store sales 
increased utilities expenses  relatively higher occupancy expenses for new and relocated stores as compared to our existing stores  and relatively higher occupancy expenses for our lane bryant stores also contributed to the increase in buying and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales 
buying expenses increased slightly as a percentage of net sales  primarily as a result of buying costs for lane bryant stores  which are relatively higher due to the product development and design process required to support a private label business 
buying expenses include payroll  payroll related costs  and operating expenses for our buying departments and warehouses 
occupancy expenses include rent  real estate taxes  insurance  common area maintenance  utilities  maintenance  and depreciation for our stores and warehouse facilities and equipment

an improvement in our credit operations a component of selling expenses as a result of reduced interest rates related to our asset securitization program was partially offset by increased delinquencies in our proprietary credit card program during the latter part of fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales in fiscal  primarily as a result of the synergistic effect of a larger sales base on corporate administrative expenses and the favorable impact of cost reduction initiatives 
selling  general  and administrative expenses exclude goodwill amortization related to our acquisition of catherine s 
other income other income was million in fiscal  a decrease of from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily caused by a decrease in interest income 
interest income decreased as a result of lower levels of invested funds and a decrease in the average yield on investments during fiscal as compared to fiscal during fiscal  investments in marketable securities were converted into cash and cash equivalents  and we used million of cash and cash equivalents in connection with the acquisition of lane bryant 
interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal  an increase of from million in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of short term and long term borrowings incurred in connection with the lane bryant acquisition  and to a lesser extent  the result of additional long term mortgage borrowings and acquisitions of point of sale equipment under long term capital leases 
income tax provision benefit the income tax benefit for fiscal was thousand resulting in a effective tax rate  as compared to an income tax provision for fiscal of million  resulting in a effective tax rate 
the unusual fiscal effective tax rate was a result of the effect of a million provision related to one of our employee insurance programs on a relatively small pre tax loss 
comparison of fourth quarter to fourth quarter net sales net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal were million  a decrease of from net sales of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease in sales was primarily attributable to negative comparative store sales at our lane bryant chain and a decrease in the number of stores in operation during the fiscal fourth quarter as a result of our store closing initiative see comparison of fiscal to fiscal restructuring charge credit above 
we experienced a quarter over quarter decrease of in overall comparable store sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal lane bryant experienced a decrease in comparable store sales as a result of poor customer acceptance of  and fit and quality issues with  certain of its products  which resulted in higher levels of promotional pricing 
in addition  certain basic products were under stocked  resulting in missed sales opportunities 
due to product lead times  these issues are expected to negatively impact lane bryant results for the fiscal first quarter  and could negatively impact results for the fiscal second quarter 
cost of goods sold  buying  and occupancy cost of goods sold  buying  and occupancy expenses were million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  a decrease of from million in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a percentage of net sales  these costs increased by in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal cost of goods sold  as a percentage of net sales  decreased in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal significantly improved margins in our fashion bug and catherine s stores were offset by reduced gross margins from the higher levels of promotional pricing at our lane bryant stores 
cost of goods sold for the fourth quarter of fiscal included million of costs related to the valuation of lane bryant inventories 
cost of goods sold for the fourth quarter of fiscal included million of costs related to the valuation of inventory for stores to be closed during the first half of fiscal as a result of the restructuring plan announced on january  buying and occupancy expenses  expressed as a percentage of net sales  increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase in buying and occupancy expenses was primarily attributable to the lack of leverage on relatively fixed occupancy costs as a result of negative overall comparable store sales  particularly at the lane bryant chain 
selling  general  and administrative selling  general  and administrative expenses were million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  a decrease of from million in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a percentage of net sales  these costs decreased by in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease is primarily a result of cost efficiencies from integration efforts and home office expense reductions at lane bryant  partially offset by the lack of leverage from negative comparable store sales and increases in employee benefit costs 
interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal  a decrease of from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of relatively lower interest rates on borrowings and reduced levels of borrowings 
during fiscal  we replaced million of convertible subordinated notes due and a million term loan with million of senior convertible notes due and paid down our short term borrowings see financing below 
recent developments on march   we announced a cost reduction plan  designed to take advantage of the centralization of all corporate administrative services throughout the company and to realize efficiencies available to us  in order to improve our profitability 
we expect this cost reduction plan to improve annualized pretax earnings by approximately million  with an improvement of approximately million in pre tax earnings during fiscal we expect that the full annual pre tax benefit of million will first be realized during the fiscal year ending january  execution of the cost reduction plan is expected to result in a pre tax charge of approximately million in fiscal components of the charge include a million non cash charge  primarily for the write down of distribution center fixed assets  and million of cash items  primarily related to severance as a result of a reduction in work force 
we expect the execution of the plan to have no material after tax cash impact 
the components of the cost reduction plan are as follows o reduction in corporate operating expenses 
our ability to realize efficiencies by streamlining processes and gaining optimal pricing through the consolidation of vendors will reduce costs 
we will continue to centralize finance  human resources  and other administrative functions in order to leverage the efficiency of our shared services organization 
o reduction in corporate and divisional workforce 
we implemented a workforce reduction at our corporate and divisional home offices of positions  or approximately 
o consolidation of distribution center operations

o closing of monsoon accessorize stores which we operate under a joint venture with monsoon plc

we tested the concept in the united states during and the performance of the stores opened during the test period did not meet our expectations 
higher than anticipated lease costs led to our decision to discontinue the operation of these stores 
we plan to close the monsoon accessorize stores during fiscal we are implementing these initiatives to position the company for increased profitability 
while our strategic focus continues to be on increasing revenue and margins  particularly at lane bryant  our immediate focus is to reduce our cost structure and leverage our size through efficiencies in operations

the increase was primarily a result of an increase in net income before non cash write downs of goodwill and capital assets  non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  and increases in prepaid and accrued expenses 
in addition  our investment in inventories  net of accounts payable  decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of improved vendor terms from conforming lane bryant s vendor terms to our corporate terms 
these changes were partially offset by a million decrease in accrued restructuring costs during fiscal our cash provided by operating activities increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  from million to million 
excluding the acquisition of lane bryant  our investment in inventories  net of accounts payable  decreased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of certain inventory management initiatives

s 
government agency bonds with early redemption provisions were called for redemption during the first half of fiscal the decrease in available for sale securities during fiscal was primarily a result of these redemptions 
we invested the proceeds from these early redemptions in cash equivalents until we acquired lane bryant in august our capital expenditures were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
in fiscal  these expenditures were primarily for the construction  remodeling  and fixturing of new and existing retail stores  additions and improvements to our corporate offices and distribution centers  the acquisition of a new distribution center in white marsh  maryland see below  and systems technology

the effect of the re negotiation was a net decrease increase in total lease payments as follows fiscal thousand  fiscal thousand  fiscal thousand  fiscal thousand  fiscal thousand  fiscal million 
on september   we acquired a  square foot distribution center on acres of land in white marsh  maryland at a cost of million 
as a result of the use of automated sorting systems and improved facility design in the white marsh facility  we will be able to consolidate both the memphis and the columbus facilities into the white marsh facility see recent developments above 
we plan to relocate the memphis distribution center by june and the columbus distribution center by december in connection with our acquisition of lane bryant from limited brands in august  we entered into an agreement with an affiliate of limited brands to use the ohio distribution center and receive related distribution services 
the lease for the columbus  ohio distribution center and the related logistics and transportation services agreement  which were originally scheduled to terminate in august  were terminated effective as of december  in accordance with early cancellation provisions of the lease and agreement

we expect to finance these capital expenditures principally through internally generated funds

total commitments under operating leases include million payable under the lane bryant master sublease with limited brands  which we have guaranteed 
we have reached a preliminary settlement with the internal revenue service regarding its audit of our corporate owned life insurance coli program 
we anticipate that the cost of the settlement will be approximately million  which includes million of income taxes and million of interest  net of a tax benefit of million 
of the million of income taxes  million will be satisfied through the use of existing operating loss and tax credit carrybacks 
the net cash payment under the settlement will be million 
the net liability for this settlement has been included in income taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheet as of february  as part of the proposed settlement  we will surrender the existing life insurance policies 
these policies have a cash surrender value of approximately million  which we will receive upon surrender of the policies 
we have reclassified the cash value of the policies from other non current assets to other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of february  although the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty  we do not believe that settlement will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have formed a trust called the charming shoppes master trust to which spirit of america national bank  our credit card bank  has transferred  through a special purpose entity  its interest in credit card receivables created under our fashion bug proprietary credit card program 
we  together with the trust  have entered into various agreements under which the trust can sell  on a revolving basis  interests in these receivables for a specified term 
when the revolving period terminates  an amortization period begins during which principal payments are made to the parties with whom the trust has entered into the securitization agreement 
we securitized million and million of credit card receivables in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and had million of securitized credit card receivables outstanding as of february  we held certificates and retained interests in our securitizations of million as of the end of fiscal  which were generally subordinated in right of payment to certificates issued by the trust to third party investors 
our obligation to repurchase receivables sold to the trust is limited to those receivables that  at the time of their transfer  fail to meet the trust s eligibility standards under normal representations and warranties 
to date  our repurchases of receivables pursuant to this obligation have been insignificant 
on november   we issued million of new five year asset backed certificates in a private placement  of which million have been sold to investors to date 
to the extent that the remaining certificates are not sold  we will hold them as a retained interest 
the weighted average fixed interest rate on the certificates sold is 
these certificates replaced an million securitization series that matured during the fourth quarter of fiscal charming shoppes receivables corp 
and charming shoppes seller  inc  our consolidated wholly owned indirect subsidiaries  are separate special purpose entities created for the securitization program 
at february   charming shoppes receivables corp 
held million of charming shoppes master trust certificates and retained interests and charming shoppes seller  inc held retained interests of million which are included in the million of retained interests we held at february  
these assets are first and foremost available to satisfy the claims of the respective creditors of these separate corporate entities  including certain claims of investors in the charming shoppes master trust 
we could be affected by certain events that would cause the trust to hold proceeds of receivables within the trust as additional enhancement  which proceeds would otherwise be available to be paid to us with respect to our subordinated interests 
for example  if either we or the trust fail to meet certain financial performance standards  a credit enhancement condition would occur and the trust would be required to retain amounts otherwise payable to us 
in addition  the failure to satisfy certain financial performance standards could further cause the trust to stop using collections on trust assets to purchase new receivables  and would require such collections to be used to repay investors on a prescribed basis  as provided in the trust agreements 
if this were to occur  it could result in our having insufficient liquidity  however  we believe we should have sufficient notice to seek alternative forms of financing through other third party providers 
as of february   the trust was in compliance with all applicable financial performance standards 
amounts placed into enhancement accounts  if not required to be paid to the other certificate holders  will be available to us at the termination of the securitization series 
we have no obligation to directly fund the enhancement account of the trust  other than for breaches of customary representations  warranties  and covenants and for customary indemnities 
these representations  warranties  covenants  and indemnities do not protect the trust or investors in the trust against credit related losses on the receivables 
the providers of the credit enhancements and trust investors have no other recourse to us 
these securitization agreements are intended to improve our overall liquidity by providing short term sources of funding 
the agreements provide that we will continue to service the credit card receivables and control credit policies 
this control allows us  absent certain adverse events  to fund continued credit card receivable growth and to provide the appropriate customer service and collection activities 
accordingly  our relationship with our credit card customers is not affected by these agreements 
see critical accounting policies asset securitizations above  market risk below  and item financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements note asset securitization for further discussion of our asset securitization program 
we also have non recourse agreements under which third parties provide accounts receivable proprietary credit card sales funding programs for both our catherine s and lane bryant stores 
these funding programs expire in january for catherine s and in january for lane bryant 
under these agreements  the third parties reimburse us daily with respect to the proprietary credit card sales generated by the respective store s credit card accounts 
under the catherine s agreement  we may be required to repurchase receivables from the third party under certain conditions relating to a change in control 
under the lane bryant agreement  we may be required to repurchase receivables from the third party upon termination of the agreement 
the net balances of catherine s accounts receivable held by the third party at february  and february  were approximately million and million  respectively 
the net balances of lane bryant accounts receivable held by the third party at february  and february  were approximately million and million  respectively

additionally  our existing credit facility and one of our agreements with limited brands restrict the payment of dividends on our common stock 
we believe that our capital resources and liquidity position are sufficient to support our current operations 
our requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  and repayment of debt and other obligations are expected to be funded from operations  supplemented as needed by short term or long term borrowings available under our credit facility  our proprietary credit card receivables securitization agreements  leases  and other available financing sources

market risk we manage our fashion bug proprietary credit card program through various operating entities that we own 
the primary activity of these entities is to service our proprietary credit card portfolio  the balances of which we sell under a credit card securitization program 
under the securitization program  we can be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates to the extent that the interest rates charged to our customers vary from the rates paid on certificates issued by the trust 
until november  the credit card program billed finance charges based on a fixed rate 
as of november  finance charges on all accounts are billed using a floating rate index the prime lending rate  subject to a floor and limited by legal maximums 
as of february   a portion of the certificates are at fixed rates 
to the extent that interest rates decline  we may be exposed to interest rate risk on our fixed rate certificates 
the floating rate index on our floating rate certificates is either one month libor or the commercial paper rate  depending on the issuance 
consequently  we have reduced our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
however  we have exposure in the movement of basis risk between the floating rate index on the certificates and the prime rate 
as of february   the floating rate finance charge rate was below the contractual floor rate  thus exposing us to a portion of interest rate risk 
to the extent that short term interest rates were to increase by one percentage point by the end of fiscal  an increase of approximately thousand in selling  general  and administrative expenses would result 
as of february   there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
to the extent that there are borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility  such borrowings would be exposed to variable interest rates 
an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and decrease our cash flows 
a decrease in market interest rates would decrease our interest expense and increase our cash flows 
we are not subject to material foreign exchange risk  as our foreign transactions are primarily us dollar denominated and our foreign operations do not constitute a material part of our business
