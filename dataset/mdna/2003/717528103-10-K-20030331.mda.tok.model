the turmoil created a general environment of rate increases and conservative risk selection in the marketplace and arose in part due to the following the significant property and casualty industry losses as a result of the tragedy of september   continued rating agency downgrades and insolvencies in the industry  and lower interest rates resulting in reduced investment income and a greater focus on underwriting margins 
in this environment  the company continued its strong growth  with gross written premiums increasing to million 
the company also believes its core strategy of adhering to an underwriting philosophy of sound risk selection and pricing discipline  the mixed marketing platform for its product distribution and creating value added features not typically found in property and casualty products have also contributed to generating premium growth above industry averages  as well as enabling the company to produce combined ratios the sum of net loss and loss adjustment expenses and acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses  divided by net earned premiums well below industry averages 
the gaap combined ratio for the year ended december  was  which  once again  was substantially lower than the property and casualty industry as a whole 
investments the company s investment objective is the realization of relatively high levels of investment income while generating competitive after tax total rates of return within a prudent level of risk and within the constraints of maintaining adequate securities in amount and duration to meet cash requirements of current operations and long term liabilities  as well as maintaining and improving the company s am best rating

the company regularly performs various analytical procedures with respect to its investments  including identifying any security whose fair value is below its cost 
upon identification of such securities  a detailed review is performed for all securities  except interests in securitized assets  meeting predetermined thresholds  to determine whether such decline is other than temporary 
if the company determines a decline in value to be other than temporary  based upon its detailed review  or if a decline in value for an equity investment has persisted continuously for nine months the cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value 
the factors considered in reaching the conclusion that a decline below cost is other than temporary include  but are not limited to  whether the issuer is in financial distress  the investment is secured  a significant credit rating action has occurred  scheduled interest payments have been delayed or missed  or changes in laws and or regulations have impacted an issuer or industry 
the amount of any write down is included in earnings as a realized loss in the period the impairment arose 
this evaluation resulted in non cash realized investment losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

if these criteria are met  an impairment charge  calculated as the difference between the current book value of the security and its fair value  is included in earnings as a realized loss in the period the impairment arose
