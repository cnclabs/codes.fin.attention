item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies we prepare the consolidated financial statements of the company in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title 
we also offer certain of our customers the right to return shafts for breakage within a limited time after delivery 
we continuously monitor and track such shaft returns  and we record a provision for the estimated amount of such future returns  based on historical experience and any notification we receive of pending returns at the time sales are made 
while such returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product failure rates and the resulting returns could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivables and our future operating results 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure that our forecasts of future product demands are reasonable  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
overview business conditions the company is principally engaged in the business of designing  manufacturing and marketing graphite carbon fiber based composite golf club shafts  with approximately of its net sales resulting from sales to golf club manufacturers for inclusion in their clubs 
as a result  the company s operating results are substantially dependent not only on demand by its customers for the company s shafts  but also on demand by consumers for clubs including graphite shafts such as the company s 
initially  graphite shafts were principally offered by manufacturers of higher priced  premium golf clubs  and the company s sales had been predominantly of premium graphite shafts 
however  over the years the company has realized substantial sales growth in the value priced segment of the graphite shaft market 
the company now competes aggressively with both united states and foreign based shaft manufacturers for premium graphite shafts and also against primarily foreign based shaft manufacturers for lower priced value shaft sales 
the company continues to maintain a broad customer base in the premium shaft market segment 
while the company s market share in the value segment is not as great as the premium segment  the company has advanced rapidly in securing new customers in this segment 
generally  value shafts have significantly lower selling prices than premium shafts and  as a result  contribute less to gross profit 
the company s sales have tended to be concentrated among a limited number of major club companies  thus making the company s results of operations dependent on those customers  their continued willingness to purchase a significant portion of their shafts from the company  and their success in selling clubs containing the company s shafts to their customers 
in  net sales to callaway golf  acushnet company and taylormade addidas golf represented  and of the company s net sales  respectively  and the company anticipates that these companies will continue  collectively  to represent the largest portion of its sales in although it is generally difficult to predict in advance the success of any particular club or of any particular manufacturer  the company believes that it is protected to some extent from normal periodic fluctuations in sales among the various golf club companies by virtue of the broad range of its club manufacturer customers 
golf club companies regularly introduce new clubs  frequently containing innovations in design 
sometimes these new clubs achieve dramatic success in the marketplace  thus increasing the overall volatility of club sales among the major companies 
while the company seeks to have its shafts represented on as many major product introductions as possible  it can provide no assurance that its shafts will be included in any particular hot club or that sales of a hot club that does not include the company s shafts will not have a negative impact on the sales of those clubs that do 
the company s sales could also suffer a significant drop off from period to period to the extent that they may be dependent in any period on sales of one or more hot clubs  which then tail off in subsequent periods when no other club offers a high level of new sales to replace the lost sales 
in  the company started manufacturing prepreg  the principal raw material in the manufacture of graphite golf shafts  at its facility in poway  california 
most of its production of prepreg is used internally by the company  with the remainder sold to other composite materials manufacturers 
the company does not expect third party sales of prepreg to have a significant financial impact on the company for at least the next several years 
in  the company established a manufacturing facility in evanston  wyoming for the production of carbon fiber 
during and through the first ten months of  the company used the material from this facility to satisfy a significant portion of its internal demand for carbon fiber in the manufacturing of golf club shafts 
during  the company also produced and sold carbon fiber from this facility to other unrelated entities for the manufacture of other carbon based products 
on october   sgl purchased a interest in the company s carbon fiber manufacturing operation 
the company and sgl entered into an agreement to operate the facility as a limited liability company with equal ownership interests between the venture partners 
the company and sgl also entered into supply agreements with the new entity  cft  for the purchase of carbon fiber at cost plus an agreed upon mark up 
the company and sgl are each responsible to bear of the fixed costs to operate the facility as a term of this supply agreement 
profits and losses of cft are shared equally by the partners 
the company anticipates that the carbon fiber from this facility will primarily be consumed by the joint venture partners  however  any excess carbon fiber produced at this facility could be marketed for sale to unrelated third parties 
the company continues to use its share of the output of this facility to satisfy a significant portion of its internal demand for carbon fiber 
if the carbon fiber facility is not operated at high production levels  either because of production difficulties or because there is not enough demand by the joint venture partners to justify that level of production  the cost per unit of carbon fiber consumed by the company and thus the cost of producing the company s golf shafts and other products is increased due to spreading the fixed costs of production over smaller volumes 
if demand is lower than production capacity  cft also runs the risk of building up excess inventory 
given the relatively low costs at the present time in the market for carbon fiber and the highly competitive market for graphite golf shafts  the failure to operate at high levels could adversely affect the company s gross margins or its ability to maintain competitive prices for its products 
although third party sales of carbon fiber could help justify high production levels and thus help control unit production costs  the weakness of the carbon fiber market and the overall excess capacity in the industry means that third party sales at cft are not likely to be significant at least until the overall market improves significantly 
the company does not expect third party sales at cft to have a significant effect on either its sales or profitability for several years 
during the s  the graphite golf shaft industry became increasingly competitive  placing extraordinary pressure on the selling prices of the company s golf shafts and adversely affecting its gross profit margins and level of profitability 
the company s response has been to reduce its cost structure  principally by producing its own prepreg and by shifting the largest portion of its shaft production to its offshore facilities  while maintaining high quality and superior customer service 
the cost saving benefits of its efforts to vertically integrate its operations  particularly through carbon fiber manufacturing  have been limited somewhat due to historically low market prices for golf shaft raw materials in recent years  which  in some cases  have made carbon fiber available in the market at attractive prices when compared to the company s cost to purchase it from cft 
although the company s gross margins and profitability have continued to be adversely affected through this period despite its efforts  management believes that these efforts have been successful to date and is allowing the company to maintain  or in some cases enhance  its competitive position with respect to the major united states golf club companies that are its principal customers 
the company continues to look for opportunities to cut costs and to increase its market share 
in an effort to reduce costs  in the company consolidated its executive offices with its manufacturing facilities in poway  california 
the pressure on selling prices of both premium and value shafts under current market conditions  and the increased percentage of overall sales represented by value shafts has resulted in a reduction of approximately in the average selling price of the company s shafts over the last seven years  although in some cases average selling prices may increase slightly from period to period depending on the mix of products sold 
in addition  the percentage of overall golf clubs sold with graphite shafts appears to have leveled off after several decades of significant growth and most major club companies continue to seek multiple sources of supply for their shafts and  thus  are unwilling to commit to one principal graphite shaft supplier 
these trends are not likely to reverse themselves under current market conditions 
as a result  management does not anticipate meaningful overall improvement in the financial performance of the company s golf shaft operations for the foreseeable future 
there will continue to be fluctuations in performance on a periodic basis  driven principally by the success of its key customers in selling clubs to consumers  but as selling prices continue to decrease  with increasing pressure on the company s margins  increases in unit sales in the future  even to levels comparable to those achieved in  are not likely to generate operating cash flows and net income at the levels achieved in or in other  similarly successful historical years 
based on the results of and the general trends and conditions of the golf industry over the last several years  the company addressed the issue of impairment of its long lived assets  specifically  goodwill  trademarks and patents during the fourth quarter of in accordance with the company s policy  management assessed the recoverability of goodwill using undiscounted cash flow projections based on the remaining amortization period of goodwill and trademarks of thirty one years 
the company believed that the future projections represented management s best estimate of future undiscounted cash flows at that time 
based on these projections  the company concluded that impairment existed as of december  in determining the amount of the impairment charge  the company utilized an independent valuation  which resulted in a write off of all the goodwill and intangible assets of approximately million during the fourth quarter of the company is responding to the current prospects in its core golf shaft business in a variety of ways 
first  the company introduced its new and innovative one shaft early in  which management intends to use to capture a portion of the market for premium branded custom shafts  which tend to sell at higher prices and gross margins than the standard shafts sold to club manufacturers 
in addition to the one shaft  the company continues to develop other premium branded custom shafts 
the company cannot now predict the success of these shafts in the market  although it anticipates that if it achieves significant market acceptance  the financial benefits are not anticipated to be material until in addition  the company has increased its marketing and advertising spending in recent years in support of its premium branded custom offerings 
second  the company continues to look for opportunities to sell its prepreg to other composite materials manufacturers and to manufacture other non golf composite materials products  such as hockey sticks 
although the company has achieved some success in these areas  management continues to believe that the growth opportunities in these areas are limited and that sales of prepreg and of other composite materials products will not be material to its results of operations for at least several years 
third  management has concluded that its ownership interest in the joint venture that operates its carbon fiber plant does not offer significant value to the company and is seeking to sell its interest  either to its joint venture partner  sgl  or  with sgl s consent  to a third party  so that the capital currently committed to the joint venture could be redeployed more usefully for the company and its stockholders 
finally  the company continues to be receptive to other acquisition opportunities  in areas related to its core business and otherwise  in an effort to add the potential for meaningful growth in its overall profitability  although the company is not actively seeking such opportunities at the present time 
although management anticipates that operating cash flow levels are likely to be measurably lower for at least the next several years than was typical until a few years ago  given the absence of debt currently on the company s balance sheet  the company should be able to generate cash from operations in excess of its needs during this period 
this excess operating cash could be used for research and development or marketing activities related to its current core business or to support expansion of its current businesses either internally or through acquisitions 
at present  the company is unable to provide any assurances that it will identify and be able to negotiate a sale of its interest in the joint venture or that it will be able to successfully complete any potential acquisitions 
results of operations the following table sets forth operating results expressed as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative impairment of goodwill impairment of trademarks patents amortization of goodwill plant consolidation operating income loss other interest expense other expense income  net equity in earnings of joint venture income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss compared to net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  to million for from million for the prior year 
the decrease in net sales was mainly attributed to a decrease in average selling prices  which were somewhat offset by an increase in shaft unit sales 
shaft unit sales increased in compared to a decrease of in as a result of an increased demand for premium shafts  while the average selling price of shafts sold in decreased compared to a decrease of in gross profit 
gross profit decreased million  or  to million in from million in the company s gross profit margin decreased to in from in  which was attributed to two factors  first  a decrease in net sales  which was a result of the decrease in average selling prices of units sold  and secondly  an increase in variable costs from increased units produced and shipped  which was somewhat mitigated by the benefit achieved by transferring a larger percentage of our premium shaft production to china in in addition  the company s gross profit was negatively affected by the increase in inventory related reserves of approximately  in  which was less than the increase of  in operating income loss 
operating loss decreased million to a loss of million in from a loss of million in the majority of the decrease was attributed to a lack of a charge for the impairment of goodwill  trademarks and patents  which the company recorded during the fourth quarter of the company wrote off the remaining balance of its goodwill  trademarks and patents in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  note the total amount of impairment charges recorded in was approximately million 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense increased approximately  which was mainly attributed to increased advertising and promotion expenses 
sg a increased as a percentage of net sales to in  from in the company recorded a charge for plant consolidation during the fourth quarter of of approximately  related to the consolidation of the company s executive offices with the company s manufacturing facilities in poway compared to  in related to the closure of two shaft manufacturing facilities in mexico 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  note other expense income 
interest expense decreased approximately  to  in as compared to  in the decrease is primarily attributed to the repayment of the company s long term debt in the company made its final debt principal payment of million on september  the majority of the company s interest expense in was attributed to interest and unused borrowing fees related to the company s line of credit in place with a financial institution 
income taxes 
the company recorded a benefit for income taxes in the amount of  in the company s effective tax rate was in at december   the company had a net deferred tax asset of approximately million 
this deferred tax asset represented net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and other basis differences which give rise to future tax deductions in excess of book deductions 
realization of these tax benefits is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income 
during the fourth quarter of  management determined that it was no longer more likely than not that the tax benefits associated with these deferred tax assets would be realized 
accordingly  the company placed a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset 
in connection with this determination  management also determined that its reserve of approximately  for contingent tax liabilities was no longer appropriate 
as such  this reserve has been eliminated 
compared to net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  to million for from million for the prior year 
the decrease in net sales was attributable to a decrease both in shaft unit sales and  to a lesser extent  in selling prices 
shaft unit sales decreased in as compared to which was a result of lower demand for both premium and value shafts  and the average selling price of shafts sold in decreased gross profit 
gross profit decreased million  or  to million in from million in  principally as a result of the decrease in net sales 
the company s gross profit margin decreased to in from in  which was primarily attributed to a higher fixed cost per unit for shafts shipped in based on lower production volumes 
in addition  the company s gross profit was negatively affected by the increase in inventory related reserves of approximately  and approximately  related to start up costs and production inefficiencies resulting from the transfer of additional premium shaft volume to china  which decreased gross margin by approximately operating income loss 
operating income decreased million to a loss of million in from million operating income in the majority of the decrease was attributed to the impairment of goodwill  trademarks and patents 
the company wrote off the remaining balance of its goodwill  trademarks and patents in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  note the total amount of impairment charges recorded in was approximately million 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense decreased approximately  which was attributable to lower incentive charges of approximately million in  which was partially offset by increased advertising and promotion expenses 
sg a in benefited from a reduction in an environmental reserve of  the company recorded plant consolidation charges in of approximately  related to the closure of two shaft manufacturing facilities in mexico 
the company has three shaft manufacturing facilities 
in  the company reflected a recovery of previously recorded plant consolidation charges in of approximately  primarily in connection with the consolidation of its domestic golf shaft manufacturing operations in california 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  note other expense income 
interest expense decreased approximately  to  in as compared to  in the decrease is primarily attributed to the scheduled payments on the company s long term debt through  which resulted in a lower debt balance for the year 
the company had a weighted average debt outstanding of million in compared to a weighted average debt outstanding of million in the company made its final debt principal payment of million on september  the weighted average interest rate on borrowings was in and other  net decreased by approximately  to  in  from  in the decrease is primarily attributed to a decrease in interest income of approximately  and an increase in other expense items of approximately  income taxes 
the company recorded a benefit for income taxes in the amount of million in the company s effective tax rate was in the effective rate was reduced in  as the company s goodwill amortization and impairment charge are non deductible for income tax purposes 
included in the million benefit recorded in was the reduction of deferred tax liabilities of approximately million related to the deferred tax liability associated with the company s trademarks that were written off as noted above 
liquidity and capital resources the company has in place a million revolving credit facility from a financial institution  which is secured by substantially all the assets of aldila golf and guaranteed by the company 
borrowings under the line of credit bear interest  at the election of the company  at the bank reference rate or at the adjusted eurodollar rate as defined plus  subject to a minimum rate of 
availability for borrowings under the line of credit  based on eligible accounts receivable and inventories  was approximately million at december  the line of credit was renewed for a one year period effective july   and automatically renews each july for successive one year periods  unless terminated as of that date 
either party may terminate the line of credit agreement by giving the other party days written notice prior to the renewal date 
there are no termination penalties for early termination during the renewal periods 
cash including cash equivalents provided by operating activities in was approximately million  compared to  in cash provided by operating activities mainly resulted from an approximate million decrease in gross inventories  which was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and income taxes receivable of  cash provided by operating activities was further affected by non cash charges from a deferred tax write down of approximately million 
the company used  for capital expenditures during management anticipates capital expenditures to approximate  for the company received distributions from cft totaling  in compared to  in future distributions must be agreed upon by both joint venture partners prior to any distribution being made 
the company believes that it will have adequate cash resources  including anticipated cash flow and borrowing availability  to meet its obligations at least through the company may from time to time consider the acquisition of businesses complementary to the company s business 
the company could require additional debt financing if it were to engage in a material acquisition in the future 
seasonality because the company s customers have historically built inventory in anticipation of purchases by golfers in the spring and summer  the principal selling season for golf equipment  the company s operating results have been affected by seasonal demand for golf clubs  which has generally resulted in highest sales occurring in the second quarter 
the timing of customers new product introductions has frequently mitigated the impact of seasonality in recent years
