item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations those statements in this section that are not historical in nature should be deemed forward looking statements that are inherently uncertain 
see forward looking statements on page and risk factors on page for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these statements 
business overview our earnings  cash flows from operations and liquidity depend upon many factors  including producing and selling refined products at margins above fixed and variable expenses 
the prices of crude oil and refined products have fluctuated substantially in our markets 
our operating results can be significantly influenced by the timing of changes in crude oil costs and how quickly refined product prices adjust to reflect these changes 
these price fluctuations depend on numerous factors beyond our control  including the demand for crude oil  gasoline and other refined products  which is subject to  among other things  changes in the economy and the level of foreign and domestic production of crude oil and refined products  worldwide political conditions  threatened or actual terrorist incidents or acts of war  availability of crude oil and refined product imports  the infrastructure to transport crude oil and refined products  weather conditions  earthquakes and other natural disasters  seasonal variation  government regulations and local factors  including market conditions and the level of operations of other refineries in our markets 
as a result of these factors  margin fluctuations during any reporting period can have a significant impact on our results of operations  cash flows  liquidity and financial position 
during  the refining industry in our market areas experienced the lowest refined product margins since a warm winter in the northeast depressed distillate margins throughout the country and jet fuel demand declined dramatically following the events of september  this in turn led us and foreign refiners to reduce distillate and jet fuel production with a corresponding increase in gasoline output 
the resulting levels of gasoline produced exceeded gasoline demand increases  leading to lower gasoline margins 
the industry experienced rapidly rising crude oil prices due to tensions with iraq during and political instability in venezuela during the fourth quarter 
these factors led to industry refining margins in our market areas that were significantly below our five year average january  through december  
we determine our five year average by comparing gasoline  diesel and jet fuel prices to crude oil prices in our market areas  with volumes weighted according to our typical refinery yields 
we experienced net losses in each of the quarters resulting from weak industry margins and additional interest and financing costs related to our acquisitions of the california refinery in may and the mid continent refineries in september in connection with these acquisitions  our total debt increased by approximately billion from june  to june  in addition  the ratings of our senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated notes were downgraded 
we have also experienced a tightening of the trade credit we receive  which has required us to issue an increased amount of letters of credit and make early payments and prepayments to certain suppliers 
despite the weak margin environment  we generated cash flows from operations of million in and reduced term debt by million including a million prepayment in january following the acquisition of the california refinery by selling over million in assets  eliminating or deferring capital expenditures  reducing expenses  achieving operating synergies and reducing inventories 
as of december   we had million in cash  no borrowings under the revolving credit facility and  with million in letters of credit outstanding  had total unused credit available of million and a total debt to capitalization ratio of 
we believe the industry conditions that led to low margins in have improved  and if this improvement continues and margins remain at or near the five year average for the remainder of  we believe we will comply with the financial covenants of our senior secured credit facility in industry margins in in most of our market areas have averaged above our five year average as described above 
the winter in the northeast has been extremely cold in  increasing demand and margins for distillates throughout the country 
jet fuel demand has slowly improved and now approaches pre september  levels 
gasoline supply is expected to tighten due to numerous factors  including changes in gasoline specifications and the voluntary phase out of mtbe in california 
however  if industry margins in our market areas drop below our five year average for any substantial period of time or if we find it necessary to borrow the remaining available amounts under our senior secured credit facility for working capital purposes  including to support trade credit requirements  we will likely need to amend our senior secured credit facility because we may not meet certain financial covenant tests during the remainder of in addition  our credit ratings may be further reduced and our trade credit may be further tightened 
we believe that we will be able to amend our senior secured credit facility or obtain covenant waivers if necessary  however  we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain such an amendment or waiver on terms and conditions acceptable to us or at all 
see also risk factors in items and beginning on page to better enable us to withstand a low margin environment similar to that experienced in  our goals include the further reduction of ongoing cash expenses and elimination or deferral of capital expenditures 
assuming these initiatives are realized and  if necessary  we are able to amend our senior secured credit facility or obtain covenant waivers  we believe cash flow from operations  amounts available under our senior secured credit facility and available cash will be adequate to meet our anticipated requirements in for working capital  capital expenditures and scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness 
in addition  we are pursuing discussions regarding possible financing alternatives to replace our senior secured credit facility 
if we pursue such alternatives  we intend to seek a debt structure designed to increase our capacity to borrow for working capital needs  to allow us to issue letters of credit instead of making early payments and prepayments to certain suppliers and apply the funds that would otherwise have been used for those payments and prepayments to repay debt and to substantially modify the financial covenants we have under our existing senior secured credit facility 
however  we cannot provide any assurances that such financing alternatives will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us or at all 
business strategy our strategy is to create a geographically focused  value added refining and marketing business that has i economies of scale  ii a low cost structure  iii superior management information systems and iv outstanding employees focused on business excellence and that seeks to provide stockholders with competitive returns in any economic environment 
our immediate focus is to reduce our level of debt through a combination of cash flow from operations  cost savings and revenue enhancements 
debt reduction in june  we announced our goal to reduce debt by million by the end of as reflected in our operating results  we experienced a weak margin environment in which negatively affected our debt reduction plans 
nevertheless  we have repaid million of term loan debt since may including a million prepayment in january 
the primary initiatives for were i asset sales  ii capital expenditure reductions  iii achievement of system wide synergies following our acquisition of refinery assets in california  iv a working capital optimization program and v a cost reduction and refinery improvement program 
for  we continue to pursue our goal to further reduce debt through positive operating cash flows and cash conservation measures based on the following strategic initiatives i a cost reduction and refinery improvement program  ii elimination or deferral of capital expenditures and refinery turnaround spending  iii achievement of system wide synergies from the acquisition of our california refinery and iv asset sales 
asset sales asset sales provided the largest contribution to our debt reduction goal in we identified certain non core asset groups to be evaluated to meet the goal of raising million  which initially included our marine services operations  the crude oil and product pipeline systems and associated terminals around the north dakota refinery  and selected retail sites 
in december  we sold our product pipeline extending from mandan  north dakota to minneapolis  minnesota and terminals in jamestown  north dakota and moorhead  sauk centre and minneapolis st 
paul  minnesota for approximately million in cash  we completed the sale of retail stations in northern california that we had acquired with the california refinery for approximately million in cash  and we completed a sale lease back transaction for of our retail sites located in alaska  hawaii  idaho and utah for cash proceeds of approximately million 
these and other miscellaneous asset sales provided aggregate net proceeds totaling approximately million 
as required under the senior secured credit facility  we used of the aggregate net proceeds to prepay term loans million in december and million in january 
we plan to dispose of an additional million of non core assets in given the limited divestiture opportunities for our marine services operations on the us gulf coast  we plan to integrate this business with our wholesale marketing and terminal operations during our goal is to increase the overall profitability of this operation as we optimize it within our existing organization 
we have explored alternatives for our crude oil pipeline in north dakota 
our objective was to sell this asset while preserving the security of supply and quality standards of our crude source for our north dakota refinery 
we have considered several potential sale structures but have not identified a transaction that meets our objectives 
therefore  we are no longer pursuing a divestiture of this asset 
reductions in capital expenditures and refinery turnaround spending another initiative is to reduce capital expenditures and refinery turnaround spending by a combined million during and we spent million in  which included million in the fourth quarter 
total capital and turnaround spending in was below the million that we targeted in june following the acquisition of the california refinery 
our current plan is to spend approximately million in  including approximately million to complete the carb iii project at the california refinery in the first quarter and approximately million primarily for major turnarounds at three of our refineries 
achievement of synergies we also are focusing on pursuing new synergies from our refinery system following the acquisition of the california refinery 
during  we achieved approximately million in synergies  surpassing our previously announced goal of million 
during the california refinery turnaround in june  we were able to achieve benefits that otherwise would have been unavailable without the california refinery 
for example  we were able to upgrade the value of intermediate feedstock produced by our other refineries through supply to our california refinery during the turnaround 
in addition  we have been able to upgrade unfinished gasoline components from elsewhere in our refinery system by blending them into finished gasoline 
we believe that we will achieve the targeted annual system synergies of million by the end of  largely due to the benefits from owning the california refinery for a full year 
working capital optimization during  one of our initiatives was to optimize our working capital 
since we began this initiative in june  we reduced our crude oil and product inventories by approximately million barrels to million barrels at the end of december the value of this inventory reduction exceeded our goal to reduce working capital by million by year end we are projecting this level of inventory at year end  however  due to seasonal factors  we expect inventory increases at various times during the year 
our effort to reduce our working capital in was partially offset by the to increase in crude oil prices during the fourth quarter and a shortening of our normal payment terms to creditors 
cost reduction and refinery improvement program our final initiative is to realize million of operating income improvements through cost reductions and refining improvements that do not require significant capital investments 
our goal was to achieve million of the operating improvements by the end of and million by the end of during the third and fourth quarters  we initiated programs to consolidate our marketing organization  eliminate non essential travel and reduce contract labor in both operations and administration 
in addition  we made other reductions in manufacturing costs  but they were offset by higher utility expenses 
through these programs and other efficiencies  we achieved our goal of million in operating improvements during in  we expect to further reduce administrative  marketing and operating expenses through reorganization and related employee cost savings  achieving economies in refinery maintenance and purchasing and cost savings from the continued rationalization of our retail assets 
see note o of notes to consolidated financial statements in item for information related to certain charges for enhanced retirement plan benefits and other employee costs to be incurred in the first quarter of refining improvements carb iii project we anticipate that the carb iii project will increase our capacity to produce carb gasoline at the california refinery by up to  bpd or approximately 
this project will enable us to comply with california regulations to phase out the use of the oxygenate known as mtbe  currently expected to be effective on january  we spent approximately million through december   and we expect to spend an additional million to complete the project in the first quarter of heavy oil conversion project we completed a heavy oil conversion project at our washington refinery in the first quarter  which enables us to process a larger proportion of lower cost heavy crude oils  to manufacture a larger proportion of higher value gasoline and to reduce production of lower value heavy products 
the upgraded fcc unit  the final major component of the heavy oil conversion project  was fully operational at the end of the first quarter of the total cost of the project was approximately million  of which million was spent in results of operations summary our net loss for the year was million net loss per basic and diluted share compared with net earnings of million per basic share and per diluted share for the net loss for was primarily the result of weak margins in each of our operating segments and additional interest and financing costs related to acquisitions in the second half of and in may charges for bridge financing fees and integration costs  primarily associated with the acquisition of the california refinery  totaled approximately million aftertax  or per share  in our results also included losses on asset sales and impairment of goodwill  which totaled approximately million aftertax  or per share 
in  we incurred approximately million aftertax  or per share  for financing fees and integration costs  primarily associated with the acquisition of our mid continent refineries 
our net earnings for the year were million per basic share or per diluted share  an increase of compared to net earnings of million per basic share or per diluted share in the earnings improvement in was primarily a result of increased refining throughput  improved operating performance and incremental operating income from acquisitions 
this improvement was partially offset by expenses related to acquisition financing and integration 
a discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to our results of operations are presented below 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes  together with the following information  are intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our operations  but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance

c certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
the value of internally produced fuel has been reclassified from manufacturing costs and is shown as a reduction in gross refining margin 
the value of internally produced fuel amounted to per barrel  per barrel and per barrel for  and  respectively  for the total refining segment 
in addition  amortization of refinery turnaround and major maintenance costs was reclassified from manufacturing costs to depreciation and amortization 
major maintenance amortization amounted to per barrel  per barrel and per barrel for  and  respectively  for the total refining segment 
management uses gross refining margin per barrel to compare profitability to other companies in the industry 
gross refining margin per barrel is calculated by dividing gross refining margin by annual total refining throughput 
gross refining margin per barrel may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities 
d manufacturing costs are primarily operating cash costs directly associated with the manufacturing process and as described in c above  exclude non cash amortization of refinery turnaround and major maintenance costs and the value of internally produced fuel 
management uses manufacturing costs per barrel to evaluate the efficiency of refinery operations 
manufacturing costs per barrel may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities 
e our gross refining margin is revenues less cost of refining feedstock and purchased products 
gross refining margin approximates total refining segment throughput times gross refining margin per barrel  adjusted for changes in refined product inventory due to selling a volume and mix of product that is different than actual volumes manufactured

g sources of total product sales included products manufactured at the refineries and products purchased from third parties 
total product sales margin included margins on sales of manufactured and purchased products and the effects of inventory changes 
compared to operating income from our refining segment was million in compared to million in our results for and included amounts from acquired operations since the dates of acquisition 
we acquired the mid continent operations in september and the california refinery in mid may the acquired california operations contributed approximately million to our refining operating income during operating income for the mid continent operations increased to million in from million in due to the full year of operation largely offset by weaker refined product margins 
the million decrease in our operating income was primarily due to weak refined product margins in margins began to decline in the fourth quarter of and remained low throughout our total refining gross margins averaged per barrel  a decrease from  reflecting lower margins in all of our comparable regions partly offset by california s margin contribution 
the gross margins on a per barrel basis in our pacific northwest  mid pacific and mid continent regions declined  and  respectively  compared to industry margins declined primarily due to above average inventory levels for finished products  rising crude oil prices and increased competition from product imports 
the industry experienced rapidly rising crude oil prices due to tensions with iraq during and political instability in venezuela during the fourth quarter 
reduced jet fuel demand and weak economic conditions in the united states and abroad impacted overall industry inventory levels and margins for distillates 
gasoline demand remained strong during and trended higher than the level 
the increased demand  however  was met with high industry gasoline production levels and increased competition from product imports 
our margins were also negatively impacted by the tightening of the price differential between light crude oil and heavy crude oil 
this primarily affected our pacific northwest and california regions 
our operating income in was also impacted negatively by the scheduled turnarounds at our washington and california refineries in the first and second quarters of  respectively  and unscheduled downtime at our washington and utah refineries in the first quarter of during the washington refinery turnaround  we completed the heavy oil conversion project  which was fully operational in march while the heavy oil conversion project contributed to our segment operating income during the last nine months of  the contribution was less than our expectation due to the tightening of the light to heavy crude price differential and weak refining margins 
on an aggregate basis  our total gross refining margin increased from to million in  reflecting throughput volumes from the mid continent and california refineries  which added thousand bpd to our total refining throughput in compared to throughput rates were reduced by at our other refineries to thousand bpd in from thousand bpd in in response to the weak margin environment in revenues from sales of refined products increased to billion in  from billion in  due to increased sales volumes from the mid continent and california refineries  partly offset by lower average product sales prices 
total product sales averaged thousand bpd in  an increase of from  while average product prices dropped to per barrel 
the increase in other revenues was primarily due to higher crude oil resales which totaled million in compared to million in costs of sales also increased primarily due to the additional throughput volumes from the mid continent and california refineries 
during the third quarter  we reduced certain inventory levels at our mid continent refineries by approximately  barrels from the year end level  resulting in the liquidation of applicable lifo inventory quantities carried at lower costs 
this reduction in lifo inventory is part of our working capital management program and decreased costs of sales by approximately million pretax in expenses  excluding depreciation  increased to million in  primarily due to additional expenses of approximately million from the mid continent and california refineries 
excluding these new operations  total expenses did not change significantly from manufacturing cost per barrel for the california refinery is higher than our other refineries because of its increased complexity and product upgrading capabilities 
depreciation and amortization increased to million  primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization of million from the mid continent and california refineries 
several currently anticipated events will impact our financial results in major maintenance turnarounds are scheduled at the utah refinery in march  the alaska refinery in the second quarter of and the north dakota refinery in the fourth quarter of we anticipate that the carb iii project at our california refinery will increase our capacity to produce carb gasoline at the refinery by up to  bpd or approximately 
subsequent to the sale of the products pipeline in december  we have continued to distribute our products through the pipeline 
we estimate that pipeline tariffs  partly offset by a decrease in depreciation  will reduce our annual operating income for the north dakota refinery by approximately million 
compared to operating income for the refining segment was million in  an increase from our mid continent operations acquired in contributed approximately million to segment operating income 
the increase was also driven by stronger refined product margins and higher refinery throughput from our mid pacific refinery and higher throughput levels at our pacific northwest refineries 
during the fourth quarter of  however  market conditions caused significant erosion in industry refining margins 
our weakest market was the pacific northwest  where our actual gross refining margin in the fourth quarter averaged per barrel  reducing this region s annual margin to per barrel compared to per barrel in for the full year  total gross refining margin per barrel remained relatively flat from on an aggregate basis  our total gross refining margin increased to million in reflecting higher throughput volumes and contributions from the mid continent operations 
we increased refinery throughput  or thousand bpd  excluding the acquired operations  as compared to in addition  we were able to process a higher percentage of lower cost heavy crude oil  which represented of refinery throughput in  compared with in revenues from sales of refined products in the refining segment increased to billion in  from billion in  due to increased sales volumes largely offset by lower prices 
total product sales averaged thousand bpd in  an increase of from  while product prices dropped to per barrel 
the decrease in other revenues was primarily due to lower crude oil resales which totaled million in compared to million in costs of sales remained flat in compared with  primarily reflecting lower prices for feedstocks and product supply offset by higher throughput 
expenses  excluding depreciation  increased by to million in  primarily due to additional operating expenses from our acquired operations and increased throughput at our other refineries 
depreciation and amortization increased from million to million  primarily reflecting the acquisition of the mid continent refinery in retail segment dollars in millions except per gallon amounts revenues a fuel merchandise and other total revenues  fuel sales millions of gallons a fuel margin gallon a b merchandise margin in millions a merchandise margin percent of sales a average number of stations during the year a total number of stations end of year segment operating income loss a gross margins fuel c merchandise and other non fuel margin total gross margins expenses a operating expenses selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization a segment operating income loss a a includes retail stations in northern california which we had acquired with the california refinery in may that we sold in december and of our retail sites located in alaska  hawaii  idaho and utah which we sold and leased back in december b fuel margin per gallon is calculated by dividing fuel gross margin by fuel sales 
fuel margin per gallon may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities 
management uses fuel margin per gallon calculations to compare profitability to other companies in the industry 
c includes the effect of intersegment purchases from our refining segment at prices which approximate market 
compared to the operating loss for our retail segment was million in compared to operating income of million in total gross margins increased to million in from million in reflecting increased sales volume  offset largely by lower fuel margin per gallon 
fuel margin decreased to per gallon in from per gallon in  reflecting continued competitive price pressures and changes in the geographic mix of our retail sites 
total gallons sold increased to million  reflecting the increase in average station count to in from in this increase in average station count was primarily due to the mid continent operations acquired in september  additional stations acquired in the pacific northwest in november  and the retail stations acquired with the california refinery assets in may these increases were partially offset by approximately bp amoco jobber dealer stations included in the mid continent acquisition that did not rebrand to the tesoro r brand name 
this decision not to rebrand resulted in us no longer being those jobber dealer stations exclusive supplier under the terms of the acquisition agreement 
the california stations  which we sold in december  contributed operating income of approximately million during the period we owned them in in addition  in december  we completed a sale lease back transaction for of our retail sites located in alaska  hawaii  idaho and utah 
the related lease expense will decrease operating income by approximately million in revenues on fuel sales increased to million in  from million in  while merchandise and other revenues increased by to million 
merchandise margin decreased  however  as a percent of sales  reflecting changes in the mix of merchandise offerings 
with our increased number of stations  expenses increased to million and depreciation increased to million in we adopted a flat to modest growth strategy for our retail segment that will focus on select jobber dealer investments in certain of our markets 
we do not expect to build any new retail stations in compared to operating income for our retail segment increased to million in  compared to a loss of million in the expansion of our tesoro operated and jobber dealer network enabled us to increase revenues and profits in our total gallons sold increased to million  while our fuel margin increased by to per gallon 
our average station count during of represents a increase from in revenues on fuel sales grew to million in  a increase from  while merchandise and other revenues increased by to million 
merchandise margin  however  as a percent of sales decreased 
with our increased number of stations  expenses increased to million and depreciation increased to million in other in addition to our refining and retail segments  we market and distribute petroleum products and provide logistical support services to the marine and offshore exploration and production industries operating in the gulf of mexico 
operating income from these operations decreased to million in from million in and lower sales volumes and service revenues contributed to this decrease 
this segment is largely dependent on the volume of offshore oil and gas drilling  workover  construction and seismic activity 
the significant decline in industry drilling activity negatively impacted sales and operating income during selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses of million in increased from million in the increase was due partially to higher expenses in the refining and retail segments associated with the purchases of refinery and marketing assets in the last half of and may corporate expenses accounted for million of the increase during  resulting from higher acquisition and integration costs  employee costs and professional fees 
selling  general and administrative expenses of million in increased million from million in this increase was partially due to higher expenses in the retail segment associated with the increased number of stations in corporate expenses accounted for million of the increase resulting largely from million in acquisition and integration costs in  as well as higher employee costs and professional fees 
during  we initiated programs to consolidate our marketing organization  eliminate non essential travel and reduce contract labor in both operations and administration 
we expect to further reduce these expenses during we will incur certain charges for enhanced retirement plan benefits and other employee costs 
the charge in the first quarter of could range from million to million pretax  depending on the number of employees electing enhanced retirement plan benefits see notes a and o of notes to consolidated financial statements in item for further information 
loss on asset sales and impairment the loss on asset sales and impairment of million in consisted primarily of losses on the sale of retail stations of million and an impairment of retail goodwill of million see notes e and l of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 
interest and financing costs interest and financing costs  net of capitalized interest  were million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to the additional debt we incurred in and in connection with our acquisitions of the mid continent and california operations 
we also expensed million during the first six months of related to bridge and other financing fees for the acquisition of the california refinery 
interest and financing costs  net of capitalized interest  were million in compared to million in this increase was primarily due to the additional debt we incurred in and to costs of approximately million related to acquisition financing 
lower interest rates in partially mitigated the impact of the increased debt levels 
we estimate interest expense for will be approximately million  reflecting million of scheduled interest payments and million primarily for amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts 
the estimated interest does not reflect potential borrowings under our revolving credit facility  prepayments of debt or charges related to possible refinancing see note a of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 
at december   we had million of deferred financing costs related to our senior secured credit facility 
if we elect to replace or modify our senior secured credit facility  we may be required to write off all or a portion of these deferred costs during the quarter in which we replace or modify the facility 
income tax provision benefit the income tax benefit amounted to million in  which compares to an income tax provision of million in the benefit resulted from the pretax losses for in  we elected to carry back net operating losses to recover income taxes paid in previous years  however  the refund of those taxes resulted in the loss of certain tax credits 
the expiration of these credits  along with other adjustments to our estimated liabilities  resulted in a reduced tax benefit of approximately million 
the income tax provision of million in increased  as compared to  primarily reflecting the increase in pretax earnings 
the combined federal and state effective income tax rate was approximately in both and capital resources and liquidity overview we operate in an environment where our liquidity and capital resources are impacted by changes in the price of crude oil and refined petroleum products  availability of trade credit  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control 
these risks include  among others  the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  fluctuations in seasonal demand  governmental regulations  worldwide political conditions and overall market and economic conditions 
see business overview on page  forward looking statements on page and risk factors on page for further information related to risks and other factors 
our future capital expenditures  as well as borrowings under our senior secured credit facility and other sources of capital  will be affected by these conditions 
our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations  issuance of equity and debt  borrowing availability under revolving lines of credit  and asset sales 
we ended with million of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet  and we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility and million in outstanding trade letters of credit 
as previously described  we sold assets in the fourth quarter from which we received net proceeds totaling million 
of this amount  million was used to prepay term loans in december an additional million was included in cash at december  and  subsequent to year end  was used to prepay term debt 
because of the weakness in industry refinery margins during and economic uncertainty  we have experienced a tightening of the trade credit we receive 
we are a significant purchaser of crude oil and other feedstocks in our market areas  which enables us to use various purchasing strategies  including open credit terms  early payments  netting agreements  and to a lesser extent  prepayments of invoices 
under current economic conditions and in light of the general uncertainty which surrounds our business  we cannot give assurance that the trade credit extended to us will not be further tightened 
we believe that we will be able to continue to operate at current production levels considering current market conditions  through our management of working capital  capital expenditures  available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility  available lines of trade credit and operating cash flows 
however  if credit extended to us were to significantly tighten or our margins were to return to levels significantly below the average levels for the last five years for an extended period of time  our business might not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to fund operations  capital expenditures and debt service 
capitalization our capital structure at december  was comprised of the following in millions debt  including current maturities senior secured credit facility tranche a term loan senior secured credit facility tranche b term loan senior secured credit facility revolver senior subordinated notes due senior subordinated notes due senior subordinated notes due junior subordinated notes other debt  primarily capital leases total debt  common stockholders equity total capitalization  at december   our debt to capitalization ratio was compared with at year end  primarily reflecting acquisition related borrowings under our senior secured credit facility and the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due  partially offset by net proceeds of million from the issuance of million shares of common stock in march  prepayment of term loans of million in december from asset sales proceeds and regularly scheduled payments of debt 
our senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated notes impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could potentially limit our ability to respond to market conditions  to raise additional debt or equity capital  or to take advantage of business opportunities 
each of these obligations is guaranteed by substantially all of our active domestic subsidiaries 
senior secured credit facility on may   we amended and restated our senior secured credit facility to increase the facility to billion from billion to partially fund the acquisition of the california refinery and retail assets 
the terms and conditions of this credit facility were subsequently amended on september   to reflect modified financial tests 
the amendment also  among other things  increased the amount of proceeds from asset sales or equity offerings that must be received and limits capital expenditures  both of which are consistent with our previously announced goals 
the credit facility was further amended in december  giving flexibility to the terms and the timing of the required proceeds from asset sales or equity offerings 
under the revised terms of the credit facility  we agreed to pay certain fees and to increase the interest rate on borrowings 
the credit facility currently consists of a five year million revolving credit facility with a million sublimit for letters of credit  a five year tranche a term loan and a six year tranche b term loan 
as of december   we had no borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility  resulting in a total unused credit available of million 
as of december   million principal amount was outstanding under the tranche a term loan and million principal amount was outstanding under the tranche b term loan 
in addition to the credit facility  we have an uncommitted letter of credit line with a bank  under which no amounts were outstanding as of december  the credit facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our active domestic subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of our material present and future assets  as well as all material present and future assets of our domestic subsidiaries with certain exceptions for pipeline  retail and marine services assets and is additionally secured by a pledge of all of the stock of all current and future active domestic subsidiaries and of the stock of our current and future foreign subsidiaries 
at december   interest rates were on the tranche a term loan and on the tranche b term loan 
borrowings bear interest at either a base rate at december  or a eurodollar rate at december   plus an applicable margin 
from september  to march   the applicable margins on the tranche a term loan and the revolving credit facility will be in the case of the base rate and in the case of the eurodollar rate and will be in the case of the base rate and in the case of the eurodollar rate for the tranche b term loan 
additionally  the tranche b eurodollar rate is deemed to be no less than 
subsequent to march   borrowing rates under the tranche a term loan and the revolving credit facility will vary in relation to our senior debt to ebitda ratio 
the credit facility interest rates also include an additional interest rate on the tranche a term loan  tranche b term loan and revolving credit facility from september  to march  and thereafter until our debt to capital ratio falls to no greater than to 
the first additional interest payment is due september  and quarterly thereafter 
we are also charged various fees and expenses in connection with the credit facility  including commitment fees and various letter of credit fees 
the credit facility requires us to meet certain financial covenants  some of which use a measure of cash flow called ebitda  as defined in the credit facility 
the financial covenants specify thresholds of the following ratios which use ebitda senior debt to ebitda  ebitda to fixed charges and ebitda to interest expense 
the initial calculations of these ratios are to be made when we issue our financial results for the quarter ending september   using the immediately preceding four quarters 
in addition  the financial covenants set a maximum threshold for total debt to total capitalization ratio  as defined in the credit facility  each quarter end commencing june  the credit facility requires a minimum cumulative consolidated ebitda amount of million and million for the nine month period ending march  and the twelve month period ending june   respectively 
the credit facility also requires a minimum consolidated quick ratio  as defined in the credit facility  each month end beginning october  through june  the credit facility limits our capital expenditure and refinery turnaround spending to no more than million in the year  million for the twelve month period ending june  and million in the calendar year and each year thereafter unless our debt to capital ratio falls below to 
under the terms of our senior secured credit facility  we are not permitted to declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock or repurchase shares of our common stock through december  beginning january   the terms allow for payment of cash dividends on our common stock and repurchase of shares of our common stock  not to exceed million in any year 
the credit facility contains other covenants and restrictions customary in credit arrangements of this kind 
noncompliance with the covenants constitutes an event of default and  if not cured by a waiver or amendment  would permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity of the credit facility  refuse to advance any additional funds under the credit facility and exercise the lenders remedies under the credit facility 
we satisfied all of the financial covenants under the credit facility for the period ended december   as well as the requirement to complete asset sales resulting in net proceeds of at least million prior to march  of this amount  million was used to prepay term loans in december an additional million  included in cash at december   was used to prepay term loans in january net proceeds from asset sales or equity offerings received in up to the date we issue financial results for the quarter ending september   are required to be applied in full to prepay the term loans 
we believe the industry conditions that led to low margins in have improved  which we believe will enable us to comply with the financial covenants of our senior secured credit facility for the remainder of the year 
however  if industry margins in our market areas drop below the five year average for any substantial period of time or if we find it necessary to borrow the remaining available amounts under our senior secured credit facility for working capital purposes  including to support trade credit requirements  we will likely need to amend our senior secured credit facility because we may not meet certain financial covenant tests during the remainder of in addition  our credit ratings may be further reduced and our trade credit may be further tightened 
we believe that we will be able to amend our senior secured credit facility or obtain covenant waivers if necessary  however  we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain such an amendment or waiver on terms and conditions acceptable to us or at all 
see also risk factors under items and beginning on page in addition  we are pursuing discussions regarding possible financing alternatives to replace our senior secured credit facility 
if we pursue such alternatives  we intend to seek a debt structure designed to increase our capacity to borrow for working capital needs  to allow us to issue letters of credit instead of making early payments and prepayments to certain suppliers and apply the funds that would otherwise have been used for those payments and prepayments to repay debt and to substantially modify the financial covenants we have under our existing senior secured credit facility 
however  we cannot provide any assurances that such financing alternatives will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us or at all

capital expenditures and refinery turnaround spending our capital expenditures and refinery turnaround spending totaled million during  as discussed below 
capital expenditures during  our capital expenditures excluding refinery turnaround and other major maintenance costs totaled million  which included million for completion of the heavy oil conversion project at our washington refinery and million for retail marketing programs 
in addition  we spent approximately million at our california refinery  including million for a project to meet carb iii gasoline production requirements and million to complete a nitrogen oxide emissions control project 
other capital spending was primarily for various refinery improvements and environmental requirements 
we reduced our capital spending plan in response to the weaker refining and retail margin environment 
our senior secured credit facility limits our total capital expenditures and refinery turnaround spending to no more than million for the twelve month period ending june  and million for the year we have deferred our spending plans for certain discretionary projects while maintaining spending to meet environmental  safety  regulatory and other operational requirements 
currently  we have adopted a flat to modest growth strategy for the retail segment that will focus on jobber investments in selected markets 
therefore  we do not expect to build any new retail sites in our current capital expenditure plan includes approximately million in excluding refinery turnaround and other major maintenance costs of approximately million 
the capital budget for the refining segment is million  including million for the completion of the carb iii project  million for other clean air and fuel projects  and other projects totaling million 
our retail capital budget is million for we expect to fund the capital spending program primarily from operating cash flows  including benefits from cost reduction programs 
refinery turnaround and other major maintenance during  we spent million for refinery turnaround and other major maintenance  including million for our scheduled turnaround of certain processing units at our california refinery in the second quarter of and million for the completion of a scheduled turnaround of the washington refinery in the first quarter of amortization of refinery turnaround and other major maintenance costs totaled million in we expect to spend approximately million  primarily for major turnarounds at three of our refineries in we estimate our annual spending for refinery turnarounds and other major maintenance to be as follows in millions refinery california washington alaska hawaii north dakota utah total long term commitments contractual commitments we have numerous contractual commitments for purchases of goods and services arising in the ordinary course of business  debt service requirements and lease commitments see notes g and q to consolidated financial statements in item 
the following table summarizes these future commitments at december  in millions beyond a debt  ship charters other operating leases other commitments total contractual cash commitments  a debt includes million paid in january from asset sales completed in december in addition to the above commitments  we have a power supply agreement at our california refinery which requires minimum payments that vary  based on market prices for electricity  over the next years 
we also anticipate we will continue to make annual base payments of approximately million from to for an mtbe facility located at our california refinery 
we lease our corporate headquarters from a limited partnership in which we own a limited interest 
the initial term of the lease is through with two five year renewal options 
lease payments and operating costs paid to the partnership totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively  and our future commitments are included in operating leases in the table above 
we account for our interest in the partnership using the equity method of accounting 
as such  the partnership s assets  primarily land and buildings  totaling approximately million and debt of approximately million are not included in our consolidated financial statements in item clean fuels and clean air capital in february  the epa finalized new regulations pursuant to the clean air act requiring reduction in the sulfur content in gasoline beginning january  to meet the revised gasoline standard  we currently estimate we will make capital improvements of approximately million through and an additional million thereafter 
this will permit all of our refineries to produce gasoline meeting the limits imposed by the epa 
in january  the epa also promulgated new regulations  pursuant to the clean air act requiring a reduction in the sulfur content in diesel fuel manufactured for on road consumption 
in general  the new diesel fuel standards will become effective on june  based on our latest engineering estimates  we expect to spend approximately million in capital improvements through to meet these new requirements 
these expenditures  however  do not include our alaska refinery where we have limited demand for low sulfur diesel which presently does not justify the capital investment 
we expect to meet this demand from other sources 
we expect to spend approximately million in additional capital improvements through to comply with the refinery mact ii regulations promulgated in april the refinery mact ii regulations will require new emission controls at certain processing units at several of our refineries 
we are currently evaluating a selection of control technologies to assure operations flexibility and compatibility with long term air emission reduction goals 
to meet california s carb iii gasoline requirements  including the mandatory phase out of using the oxygenate known as mtbe  we expect to spend approximately million in at our california refinery 
the project should be completed in the first quarter of estimated capital expenditures described above to comply with the clean air act and california regulations are summarized in the table below in millions 
beyond lower sulphur gasoline washington north dakota utah total for lower sulphur gasoline lower sulphur diesel washington north dakota utah california total for lower sulphur diesel refinery mact ii california carb iii gasoline total other environmental matters extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations govern our operations 
these laws  which change frequently  regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and may require us to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various sites  install additional controls  or make other modifications or changes in use for certain emission sources 
we are currently involved in remedial responses and have incurred cleanup expenditures associated with environmental matters at a number of sites  including certain of our owned properties 
at december   our accruals for environmental expenses totaled approximately million 
our accruals for environmental expenses include retained liabilities for prior owned or operated properties  refining  pipeline  terminal and marine services operations and retail service stations 
based on currently available information  including the participation of other parties or former owners in remediation actions  we believe these accruals are adequate 
in connection with the acquisition of the north dakota and utah refineries  we assumed the sellers obligations and liabilities under a consent decree among the united states  bp exploration and oil co  amoco oil company and atlantic richfield company 
bp entered into this consent decree for both the north dakota and utah refineries for various alleged violations 
as the new owner of these refineries  we are required to address issues including leak detection and repair  flaring protection and sulfur recovery unit optimization 
we currently estimate that we will spend an aggregate of million to comply with this consent decree 
in addition  we have agreed to indemnify the sellers for all losses of any kind incurred in connection with the consent decree 
in connection with the acquisition of the california refinery  subject to certain conditions  we assumed the seller s obligations pursuant to its settlement efforts with the environmental protection agency concerning the section refinery enforcement initiative under the clean air act  except for any potential monetary penalties  which the seller retains 
we believe these obligations will not have a material impact on our financial position 
based on latest estimates  we will need to expend additional capital at the california refinery for reconfiguring and replacing above ground storage tank systems and upgrading piping within the refinery 
these costs are currently estimated at approximately million through and an additional estimated million through both of these cost estimates are subject to further review and analysis 
in addition to these capital expenditures  the california refinery will require expenditures related to remediation 
soil and groundwater conditions at the california refinery may require substantial expenditures over time 
our current estimate of costs to address environmental liabilities including soil and groundwater conditions at the refinery in connection with various projects  including those required pursuant to orders by the california regional water quality control board  is approximately million  of which approximately million is anticipated to be incurred through and the balance thereafter 
we believe that we will be entitled to indemnification for approximately million of such costs  directly or indirectly  from former owners or operators of the refinery or their successors under two separate indemnification agreements 
additionally  if remediation expenses are incurred in excess of the indemnification  we expect to receive coverage under one or both of the environmental insurance policies discussed in note d of notes to consolidated financial statements in item conditions that require additional expenditures may transpire for our various sites  including  but not limited to  our refineries  tank farms  retail gasoline stations operating and closed locations and petroleum product terminals  and for compliance with the clean air act and other state  federal and local requirements 
we cannot currently determine the amount of these future expenditures 
for further information on environmental matters and other contingencies  see note q of notes to consolidated financial statements in item pension funding for all eligible employees  we provide a qualified defined benefit retirement plan with benefits based on years of service and compensation 
our executive security plans also provide certain executive officers and other key personnel with supplemental death or retirement benefits based on years of service and compensation 
we contributed million in and expect to contribute million and million in and  respectively  to these plans 
while our long term expected return on plan assets is  our pension plan assets experienced losses of million in and million in our expected contributions in and are affected by returns on plan assets  employee demographics and other factors 
see note o of notes to consolidated financial statements in item for further discussion 
conversion of preferred stock on july   our premium income equity securities automatically converted into  shares of our common stock
