item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations operating revenue increased percent to million in from million in this compares with an increase of percent in from million in total miles traveled increased percent in and percent in the increases in revenue and total miles traveled were primarily the result of transporting additional freight associated with increased business from existing and new customers and our larger fleet 
other key factors affecting our operating revenue include fuel surcharges  freight rates and equipment utilization 
our contracts with customers provide for fuel surcharges based upon defined fluctuations in the price of diesel fuel 
the increases in operating revenue  net of fuel surcharges to our customers  were percent in and percent in market fluctuations in the price of diesel fuel resulted in fuel surcharge revenue of million in  million in and million in average freight rates increased percent in and declined percent in equipment utilization  measured by average miles traveled per tractor  decreased percent in  while increasing percent in we expect operating revenue in to exceed levels primarily due to a planned increase in our average number of tractors and continued customer demand 
operating expenses in represented percent of operating revenue  compared with percent in and percent in revenue generated per tractor declined percent in  compared with a percent increase in the adverse changes in our operating ratio in each of the last two years resulted from significant increases in our insurance and claims expense  as well as other increased operating expenses  as discussed in more detail below 
the transportation of additional freight and growth in our fleet  in addition to the items discussed below  have increased most expense categories during the last three years 
our employees health insurance expense  which is included within salaries  wages and benefits expense in the statements of operations  increased by million to million in  or percent of revenue  up from percent in and percent in the increases in and were due to increased premiums on our excess health insurance coverage and higher estimated costs of our self insured medical claims 
the average number of independent contractor owned vehicles increased each of the last two years  which caused purchased transportation expense  net of fuel surcharges paid to independent contractors  to increase percent in and percent in decreases in the price of diesel fuel caused fuel surcharges paid to independent contractors to decrease by  in and by million in independent contractors are responsible for their own salaries  wages and benefits expense  fuel and fuel taxes expense  and supplies and maintenance expense 
as a result  our use of independent contractors generally reduces our expenses in these categories as a percentage of revenue 
the decrease in diesel fuel prices in caused fuel and fuel taxes expense to decrease percent from the price of diesel fuel also decreased in however  increased miles traveled caused fuel and fuel taxes expense to increase by percent in insurance and claims expense increased by million to million  or percent of revenue  in  compared with percent in and percent in higher insurance premiums and claim retention levels along with an increase in accident and cargo claims caused this expense to significantly increase in and we anticipate that our insurance and claims expense as a percentage of revenue in will not increase from levels due to our increased emphasis on claims management and our driver safety  training and screening 
a decline in the market value received for used revenue equipment caused a small loss on the disposition of revenue equipment in this loss compares with gains of million in and  in we anticipate our operating expenses  as a percentage of revenue  will decline slightly from current levels 
interest expense as a percentage of revenue has declined over the last three years to percent in  compared with percent in and percent in lower interest rates  along with a significant reduction in our average long term debt outstanding  has caused our interest expense to decline during the last two years 
we reduced our long term debt in by million and in by million 
we use long term debt to finance our purchase of revenue equipment 
we anticipate interest expense in as a percentage of revenue will remain at levels or will decrease to the extent we continue reducing our long term debt  assuming interest rates do not rise in interest income increased significantly in due to an increase in the number of tractors leased under direct financing lease transactions to independent contractors 
we expect interest income to remain at current levels in our effective income tax rate was percent in each of the last three years 
we anticipate our effective income tax rate will remain at approximately percent in inflation affects most of our operating expenses 
the impact of inflation  however  was minimal during the three years ended december  capital resources and liquidity our operating activities provided net cash of million in  compared with net cash provided of million in and million in the nature of our business requires us to continually update and expand our fleet with new  more efficient revenue equipment 
investments in property and equipment and other assets used net cash of million in  million in and million in financing activities  primarily changes in long term debt  used net cash of million in and million in and generated net cash of million in any future decrease in customer demand could reduce our cash flows from operations and cause an increase in our long term debt 
our cash management practices utilize our unsecured committed credit facility to minimize both cash and debt balances 
we maintain an unsecured committed credit facility in the amount of million with two banks 
at december   we had under this facility a principal balance of million outstanding  letters of credit totaling million outstanding and borrowing capacity available to us of million 
this facility matures in january and bears interest at a variable rate based upon either the london interbank offered rate plus applicable margins or the banks prime rate weighted average rate for the facility was percent at december  
we have outstanding series a senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal balance of million at december  these notes mature in october  require annual principal payments of million which began in october and bear interest at a fixed rate of percent 
we also have outstanding series b senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal balance of million at december  these notes mature in april  require annual principal payments of million beginning in april and bear interest at a fixed rate of percent 
our total long term debt as of december  was million  with million maturing in october our unsecured committed credit facility prohibits us from paying  in any fiscal year  dividends in excess of percent of our net income from the prior fiscal year 
the debt agreements discussed above also contain restrictive covenants which  among other matters  require us to maintain certain financial ratios  including debt to equity  minimum tangible net worth  cash flow leverage and interest coverage ratios 
we were in compliance with all such debt covenants at december  we have million in direct financing lease receivables from independent contractors as of december   compared with million in receivables as of december  these leases  which are collateralized by the tractors leased  are used to attract and retain qualified independent contractors 
we repurchased  shares of our common stock during the repurchased shares have been retired  reducing stockholders equity by million in we sold our maintenance facility in georgia and purchased a new maintenance facility  which is also in georgia  during for a net cash payment of approximately  cash flows from operations and proceeds from long term debt were used to fund these expenditures 
we are committed to a purchase million of new revenue equipment in  b provide revolving loans to mw logistics  llc totaling million through  and c operating lease obligations totaling  through we have historically met and expect to meet our working capital requirements by effectively utilizing our operating profits and our unsecured committed credit facility  maintaining short turnover in accounts receivable and adhering to prudent cash management practices 
we have not used and do not anticipate using short term borrowings to meet working capital needs 
we believe our liquidity will adequately meet expected near term operating requirements 
the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands and and thereafter total long term debt obligations purchase obligations for revenue equipment operating lease obligations total off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements during the three years ended december  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make decisions based upon estimates  assumptions  and factors it considers as relevant to the circumstances 
such decisions include the selection of applicable accounting principles and the use of judgment in their application  the results of which impact reported amounts and disclosures 
changes in future economic conditions or other business circumstances may affect the outcomes of management s estimates and assumptions 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those anticipated 
a summary of significant accounting policies followed in preparation of the financial statements is contained in note to the financial statements 
other footnotes describe various elements of the financial statements and the assumptions upon which specific amounts were determined 
our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition 
we record revenue and related expenses on the date shipment of freight is completed 
insurance and claims 
we self insure  in part  for losses relating to workers compensation  auto liability  general liability  cargo and property damage claims  along with employees health insurance 
we maintain insurance coverage for per incident and total losses in amounts we consider adequate based upon historical experience and our ongoing review 
however  we could suffer losses over our policy limits  which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results 
we have million in letters of credit to guarantee settlement of claims under agreements with our insurance carriers and regulatory authorities 
we reserve currently for anticipated losses 
the insurance and claims accruals in our balance sheets  which were million as of december  and million as of december   are computed by applying a combination of our internal and industry historical loss development factors to our identified losses 
we periodically evaluate and adjust our insurance and claims accruals for changes in identified losses and in historical loss development factors 
we believe that these loss development factors have historically been reasonable  as indicated by the adequacy of our insurance and claims accruals compared to settled claims 
ultimate results could differ from these current estimates 
property and equipment 
the transportation industry requires significant capital investments in revenue equipment 
our net property and equipment was million as of december  and million as of december  our depreciation expense was million for  million for and million for we compute depreciation of our property and equipment for financial reporting purposes based on the cost of each asset  reduced by its estimated salvage value  using the straight line method over its estimated useful life 
we determine and periodically evaluate our estimate of the projected salvage values and useful lives primarily by considering the market for used equipment  prior useful lives and changes in technology 
we believe that our past estimates have been reasonable  as evidenced by our gains and losses on disposition of revenue equipment 
ultimate results could differ from these current estimates 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell 
related party transactions we purchase fuel  tires and related services from a company in which one of our directors is the president and a stockholder 
our payments to that company were million in  million in and million in we acquired a percent equity interest in mw logistics  llc  or mwl  through an investment of  in november we earned million of our revenue in and million of our revenue in through transportation services arranged by mwl  a provider of logistics services to the transportation industry 
we also have a trade receivable of million from mwl as of december  we have a commitment subject to restrictive covenants through march to provide revolving loans to mwl in the amount of million 
we have informed mwl that we do not intend to call for payment of this loan before january  the balance of our revolving loan receivable from mwl was  as of december  we believe that these transactions with related parties are on reasonable terms which  based upon market rates  are comparable to terms available from unaffiliated third parties 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation elaborates on disclosure requirements for obligations by a guarantor under certain guarantees 
this interpretation also requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of an obligation undertaken in issuing a guarantee 
we will apply the provisions of interpretation no 
for initial recognition and measurement provisions to guarantees issued or modified after december   as required 
we did not have any guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  as of december  which would require disclosure under interpretation no 
forward looking statements and risk factors this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements 
such statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of any statements not of historical fact may be considered forward looking statements 
written words such as may  expect  believe  anticipate or estimate  or other variations of these or similar words  identify such statements 
forward looking statements in this annual report include  but are not limited to  the following the statement regarding our expected operating revenue appearing in the first paragraph under results of operations  the statement regarding our anticipated operating expenses appearing in the third paragraph under results of operations  the statements regarding our anticipated interest expense and expected interest income appearing in the fourth paragraph under results of operations  the statement regarding our anticipated effective income tax rate appearing in the fifth paragraph under results of operations  the statement regarding the adequacy of our liquidity appearing in the seventh paragraph under capital resources and liquidity  and the additional statements set forth below in this forward looking statements and risk factors section 
these statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties  and actual results may differ materially  depending on a variety of factors and risks  including but not limited to those discussed below 
we face accident risks  and our insurance costs are affecting our profitability 
we self insure  in part  for losses relating to workers compensation  auto liability  general liability  cargo and property damage claims  along with employees health insurance 
we maintain insurance coverage for per incident and total losses in amounts we consider adequate based upon historical experience and our ongoing review 
we reserve currently for anticipated losses 
the insurance and claims reserves are periodically evaluated and adjusted to reflect our experience 
however  ultimate results could differ from these current estimates and we could suffer losses over our policy limits  which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results 
in addition  our operating ratio has deteriorated in the last two years  in large part due to significant increases in our insurance and claims expense 
higher insurance premiums and claim retention levels along with an increase in accident and cargo claims caused this expense to significantly increase in and any future increase in our insurance and claims expense would have a negative impact on our profitability 
increases in diesel fuel prices may adversely affect our profitability 
our operations are heavily dependent upon the use of diesel fuel 
fuel and fuel taxes expense represented percent of our total operating revenue during the price and availability of diesel fuel can vary 
prices and availability of all petroleum products are subject to political  economic and market factors that are beyond our control 
significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
historically  we have been able to recover a portion of diesel fuel price increases from customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to collect fuel surcharges in the future 
our industry is prone to employee and independent contractor driver shortages and high turnover rates 
we and others in our industry often face employee and independent contractor driver shortages 
due in part to current economic conditions  including the cost of fuel and insurance  the available pool of independent contractor drivers is smaller than it has been historically 
accordingly  we may face difficulty increasing the number of our independent contractor drivers in  which is one of our principal sources of planned growth for in addition  we  along with others in our industry  face high turnover rates of drivers 
our turnover of drivers and independent contractors was percent in based on industry surveys  we believe our driver turnover rate is in line with the industry 
we believe that several factors  including our compensation structure for both employee drivers and independent contractors  will enable us to attract and retain high quality drivers and independent contractors 
however  we expect recruiting competition to remain high 
if we are unable to hire and retain sufficient numbers of drivers  our business could suffer 
we operate in a highly competitive and highly regulated industry  and the actions of competitors and regulatory officials could harm our business 
the trucking industry is highly competitive and contains relatively low barriers to entry 
trucking firms with which we compete  as well as new market entrants  could attempt to underprice us or otherwise reduce or eliminate our business opportunities 
for freight not requiring protective service trailers  our competitors also include dry freight truckload carriers and railroads 
additionally  we operate in a highly regulated industry 
we are regulated by the dot  fhwa and state and local authorities along our routes 
we must comply with the rules and regulations of the regulatory agencies governing us in order to maintain our operating authority 
any disruption in our operating authority could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to new epa regulations that will impact our fleet 
the environmental protection agency  or epa  recently adopted engine emission standards for newly manufactured truck engines 
engines manufactured in or after october are subject to these new standards 
compliance likely will cause tractor costs to increase substantially  with respect to acquisition costs  fuel efficiency and maintenance expenses 
to mitigate the immediate impact of these regulations  we increased our purchase of tractors manufactured prior to october we do not anticipate significant purchases of tractors in  but will need to purchase epa compliant engines in and beyond 
we face general economic risk 
the success of our business depends in large part on general business conditions of our customers and general and regional economic conditions 
if the economy slows  our customers may be expected to ship less volume or seek lower rates 
on the other hand  if the economy improves and unemployment rates decrease  it generally increases the trucking industry s driver shortage 
many other economic conditions affect our business  including fuel prices  possible military action in iraq and elsewhere  acts or threats of terrorism  interest rates and tax rates 
because we cannot control the economy  our business is subject to general economic volatility 
one particular area of volatility we face is volatility in the market for revenue equipment 
the transportation industry requires significant capital investments in revenue equipment 
as we replenish our fleet with new tractors and trailers  we dispose of our used revenue equipment 
if we overestimate the salvage value of our used revenue equipment  it would cause a future loss on disposition of our revenue equipment 
seasonality and the impact of weather can affect our profitability 
historically  the trucking industry has experienced seasonal fluctuations in revenue and expenses 
we normally experience revenue declines after the winter holiday season as customers reduce shipments 
the weather can also affect us 
generally  operating expenses temporarily increase in the winter due to reduced fuel efficiency and additional maintenance cost 
poor weather can increase our operating expenses  which in turn can decrease our profitability 
accordingly  prolonged poor weather can have an adverse effect on our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk our operations are heavily dependent upon the use of diesel fuel 
fuel and fuel taxes expense represented percent of our total operating revenue during the price and availability of diesel fuel can vary 
prices and availability of all petroleum products are subject to political  economic and market factors that are beyond our control 
significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
historically  we have been able to recover a portion of diesel fuel price increases from customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
we previously utilized commodity swap agreements to partially hedge our exposure to diesel fuel price fluctuations  but all such agreements have expired by december  effective january   we began recognizing the fair market value of commodity swap agreements 
the swap agreements were marked to market each quarter 
during  accumulated other comprehensive loss was reversed by   net of income taxes to reflect an unrealized gain and expiration of the remaining notional amount on our commodity swap agreements from january  to december  interest rate risk our credit facility described in note to the financial statements carries interest rate risk 
amounts borrowed under this agreement are subject to interest charges at a rate equal to either the london interbank offered rate plus applicable margins  or the bank s prime rate 
should the lenders prime rate change  or should there be changes to the london interbank offered rate  our interest expense will increase or decrease accordingly 
as of december   we had borrowed million subject to interest rate risk 
on this amount  each basis point increase in the interest rate would cost us  in additional gross interest cost on an annual basis
