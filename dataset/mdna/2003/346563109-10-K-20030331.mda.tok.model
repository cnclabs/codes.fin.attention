item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading independent emerging technology research firm that conducts research and analysis on the impact of emerging technologies on business  consumers  and society 
we provide our clients with an integrated perspective on technology and business  which we call the wholeview 
this approach provides companies with the strategies  data  and product evaluations they need to win customers  identify new markets  and gain competitive operational advantages 
our products and services primarily are targeted to benefit the senior management  business strategists  and marketing and technology professionals at billion plus companies who use our prescriptive  executable research to understand and capitalize on business models and emerging technologies 
we derive revenues from memberships to our core research and from our strategic services and forum and summit events 
we offer contracts for our products and services that are typically renewable annually and payable in advance 
research revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
accordingly  a substantial portion of our billings is recorded as deferred revenue 
billings attributable to advisory services are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue when performed 
similarly  forum and summit billings are initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized upon completion of each event 
our operating expenses consist of cost of services and fulfillment  selling and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and amortization 
cost of services and fulfillment represents the costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services  and it includes the costs of salaries  bonuses  and related benefits for research personnel and all associated editorial  travel  and support services 
selling and marketing expenses include salaries  employee benefits  travel expenses  promotional costs  sales commissions  and other costs incurred in marketing and selling our products and services 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of the technology  operations  finance  and strategy groups and our other administrative functions 
overhead costs are allocated over these categories according to the number of employees in each group 
we believe that the agreement value of contracts to purchase research and advisory services provides a significant measure of our business volume 
we calculate agreement value as the total revenues recognizable from all research and advisory service contracts in force at a given time  without regard to how much revenue has already been recognized 
agreement value decreased to million at december  from million at december  agreement value decreased to million at december  from million at december  no single client accounted for more than of agreement value at december  our historical experience is that a majority of client companies renew expiring contracts each year 
approximately   and of our client companies with memberships expiring during the years ended december    and  respectively  renewed one or more memberships for our products and services 
these renewal rates are not necessarily indicative of the rate of future retention of our revenue base 
the declines in agreement value and renewal rates are reflective of the more difficult economic environment and will lead to a decrease in revenue for reorganizations on july   we announced a reduction of our work force by approximately positions in response to conditions and demands of the market 
as a result  we recorded a reorganization charge of approximately million during approximately of the terminated employees had been members of the sales force  while had been in research and had held administrative roles 
the charge consisted primarily of severance and related benefits costs  office consolidation costs  such as contractual lease commitments for space that was vacated  the write off of related leasehold improvements  and other payments for professional services incurred in connection with the reorganization 
additional depreciable assets that were written off consisted primarily of computer equipment  software and furniture and fixtures related to vacated locations in connection with the reorganization 
total costs related to the july  reorganization are as follows accrued as of total non cash cash december  charge charges payments in thousands workforce reduction facility consolidation and other related costs depreciable assets total   there have been no changes in estimates during the periods presented 
the accrued costs related to the july  reorganization are expected to be paid in the following periods accrued as of december  in thousands workforce reduction facility consolidation and other related costs total on january   we announced a reduction of our work force by approximately positions in response to conditions and demands of the market and a slower economy 
as a result  we recorded an initial reorganization charge of approximately million in the three months ended march  approximately of the terminated employees had been members of the sales force  were in research and had held administrative roles 
the initial charge consisted primarily of severance and related benefits costs  office consolidation costs  such as contractual lease commitments for space that was vacated  the write off of related leasehold improvements  and other payments for professional services incurred in connection with the reorganization 
additional depreciable assets that were written off included computer equipment  software  and furniture and fixtures related to terminated employees and vacated locations in connection with the reorganization 
during the three months ended september   we revised our estimates of the january  reorganization charge to provide for additional losses for office consolidation costs and the write off of related leasehold improvements due to deteriorating real estate market conditions 
as a result  we recorded an additional reorganization charge of approximately  we also concluded that approximately  of the initial reorganization charge associated with severance was excess  and accordingly  reversed that amount through reorganization costs in the statement of income during the three months ended september  total costs related to the january  reorganization are as follows total accrued as of initial subsequent non cash cash december  charge revision charges payments in thousands workforce reduction   facility consolidation and other related costs   depreciable assets   total     the accrued costs related to the january  reorganization are expected to be paid in the following periods accrued as of december  in thousands facility consolidation and other related costs    on july   we announced a sales force reorganization and general work force reduction in response to conditions and demands of the market and a slower economy

this charge also included office consolidation costs  such as contractual lease commitments for space that was vacated  the write off of related leasehold improvements  and other payments for professional services incurred in connection with the reorganization 
additional depreciable assets that were written off included computer equipment  software  and furniture and fixtures related to terminated employees and vacated locations in connection with the reorganization

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  non marketable investments  and goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
for a discussion of our other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  beginning on page f revenue recognition 
we generally invoice our core research  advisory  and other services when orders are received 
the contract amount is recorded as accounts receivable and deferred revenue when the client is invoiced 
core research is generally recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the agreement 
advisory services are recognized as revenue during the period in which the services are performed 
revenue from events is recognized upon completion of the event 
furthermore  our revenue recognition determines the timing of commission expenses that are deferred and expensed to operations as the related revenue is recognized 
we evaluate the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date 
as of december   deferred revenues and deferred commissions totaled million and million  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make contractually obligated payments that totaled approximately  as of december  management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  current economic trends  and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
non marketable investments 
we hold minority interests in companies and equity investment funds that totaled approximately million as of december  our investments are in companies that are not publicly traded  and  therefore  no established market for these securities exists 
we have a policy in place to review the fair value of our investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of the investments in these companies 
we record an impairment charge when we believe that an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
we recorded impairment charges that totaled approximately million in and in future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
goodwill 
we have goodwill related to our european operations that totaled approximately million as of december  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized but instead be measured for impairment at least annually or whenever events indicate that there may be an impairment 
in order to determine if an impairment exists  we obtain an independent appraisal which determines if the carrying amount of the reporting unit with goodwill exceeds the fair value 
the estimates of the reporting unit s fair value are based on market conditions and operational performance 
we have selected november th as the date of performing the annual goodwill impairment test 
as of december   we believe that the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets is not impaired 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired business are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the loss is recognized 
income taxes 
we have deferred tax assets related to temporary differences between the financial statement and tax base of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss carryforwards that totaled approximately million as of december  in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible and the carryforwards expire 
although realization is not assured  based upon the level of historical taxable income of forrester and projections for forrester s future taxable income over the periods during which the deferred tax assets are deductible and the carryforwards expire  management believes it is more likely than not that forrester will realize the benefits of these deductible differences 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced

these same factors also resulted in a decrease in revenues from core research as a percentage of total revenues 
no single client company accounted for more than of revenues in advisory services and other revenues decreased to million in  from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to the smaller number of events we held in  which was six forums and eight summits  compared to nine forums and six summits held during the year ended december  the more difficult economic environment also resulted in a decrease in sales of advisory services 
in addition  the reduction of our research organization responsible for performing advisory services to at december  from at december  contributed to the decrease in advisory services performed

the decreases in these expenses in absolute dollars is primarily due to compensation related costs and travel and entertainment expense savings associated with the reduction in staffing in our research organization to at december  from at december  the decrease in expenses is also due to a reduction in events expense as we hosted fewer events and had a higher mix of lower costing summits in compared to selling and marketing

results of quarterly operations the following tables set forth a summary of our unaudited quarterly operating results for each of our eight most recently ended fiscal quarters 
we have derived this information from our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements  which  in the opinion of our management  have been prepared on a basis consistent with our financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report and include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states when read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
historically  our total revenues  operating profit  and net income in the fourth quarter have reflected the significant positive contribution of revenues attributable to advisory services performed and forum events held in the fourth quarter

in addition  we received million of net proceeds from our public offering of common stock in february  as well as proceeds from exercises of employee stock options and our employee stock purchase plan of million in and million in memberships for core research  which constituted approximately of our revenues for the year ended december   are annually renewable and are generally payable in advance 
we generated cash from operating activities of million in and million in this decline in cash from operations is primarily the result of the decrease in agreement value from million at december  to million at december  which is reflected in lower accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances as of december  and a decrease in net income from million in to  in such declines in key business metrics reflect the more difficult economic environment 
included in cash from operations are deferred tax benefits of million in and million in  which resulted primarily from stock option exercises 
these exercises have generated a cumulative tax deduction of approximately million for us 
the remaining million of this tax deduction will be carried forward to offset future taxable income 
the offset of these deferred tax benefits have been recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital within stockholders equity 
during  we used million of cash in investing activities  consisting primarily of million for purchases of property and equipment and million for purchases of non marketable investments offset by million of proceeds from net sales of marketable securities 
we regularly invest excess funds in short and intermediate term interest bearing obligations of investment grade 
during  we used million of cash in financing activities consisting of million for repurchases of our common stock and million for the investment in a structured stock repurchase program offset by million in proceeds from exercises of employee stock options and proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan 
in february  we acquired giga for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash pursuant to a tender offer and second step merger at a price of per share of giga common stock in cash 
the purchase price was paid out of our cash on hand 
in october  we announced a program authorizing the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
the shares repurchased will be used  among other things  in connection with our employee stock option and purchase plans and for potential acquisitions 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of million 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and marketable securities of million 
we do not have a line of credit and do not anticipate the need for one in the foreseeable future 
we plan to continue to introduce new products and services and to invest in our infrastructure during the next months 
we believe that our current cash balance  marketable securities  and cash flows from operations will satisfy working capital  financing activities  and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next two years including cash requirements related to the purchase of giga and our stock repurchase program 
during the three months ended september   we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement giving us the right to acquire shares of our common stock in exchange for an up front net payment of million 
upon expiration of the agreement in november  we received  shares of our common stock 
during the three months ended december   we entered into a similar agreement in exchange for an up front net payment of million 
pursuant to the agreement  if our stock price is above on the expiration date  we will have the investment of million returned with a premium 
if our stock price is below on the expiration date  we will receive  shares of our common stock 
the million up front net payment is recorded in stockholders equity as a reduction of additional paid in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance as of december  upon expiration of the agreement in february  we received  shares of our common stock 
in june  we committed to invest million in two private equity investment funds over a period of up to five years 
we have adopted a cash bonus plan to pay bonuses  after the return of invested capital  measured by the proceeds of a portion of the share of net profits from these investments  if any  to certain key employees  subject to the terms and conditions of the plan 
the payment of such bonuses would result in compensation expense with respect to the amounts so paid 
as of december   we had contributed approximately million to the funds 
in february  we contributed an additional million to the funds 
as of december   we had recorded total write downs to the private equity investment funds of million as a result of the permanent impairment of certain investments within the funds 
the timing of the recognition of future gains or losses from the investment funds is beyond our control 
as a result  it is not possible to predict when we will recognize such gains or losses  if we will award cash bonuses based on the net profit from such investments  or when we will incur compensation expense in connection with the payment of such bonuses 
if the investment funds realize large gains or losses on their investments  we could experience significant variations in our quarterly results unrelated to our business operations 
these variations could be due to significant gains or losses or to significant compensation expenses 
while gains may offset compensation expenses in a particular quarter  there can be no assurance that related gains and compensation expenses will occur in the same quarter 
as of december   we had contractual obligations as follows in thousands gross of estimated restructuring provisions payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases      the above table does not include the remaining million of capital commitments to the private equity investment funds described above due to the uncertainty in timing of capital calls made by such funds to pay this remaining capital commitment

we do not maintain any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
we hold minority interests in companies and equity investment funds having operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus 
during and  we recognized revenues of approximately  and  respectively  related to a core research with advisory services contract purchased by one of the private equity investment firms 
the remaining revenues will be recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy through the termination date of the contract in march the prices for these transactions were determined as a function of our list price 
we purchased data from companies in which we held a minority interest that totaled approximately  in   in  and  in we believe that the services received were on arm s length terms and at fair market value 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement supersedes emerging issues task force eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
under sfas no 
 a liability for a cost associated with a disposal or exit activity is recognized at fair value when the liability is incurred rather than at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan as required under eitf the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early adoption permitted 
we will apply the provisions of this standard to all restructuring activities initiated after january  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we will continue to account for stock based compensation in accordance with apb no 
as such  we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we adopted the disclosure only provision of sfas no 
as of december  in november  the eitf issued eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
under eitf  revenues for contracts which contain multiple deliverables are allocated among the separate units based on their relative fair values 
the provisions of eitf are effective for contracts entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  of eitf on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation for variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
which requires all variable interest entities vies to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial interest in the vie 
in addition  the interpretation expands the disclosure requirements for both variable interest entities that are consolidated as well as vies from which the entity is the holder of a significant amount of beneficial interests  but not the majority 
fin is effective for all vies created or acquired after january  for vies created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  the adoption of this interpretation is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
interest rate sensitivity 
we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of federal and state government obligations and corporate obligations  with a weighted average maturity of less than one year 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity except for any future acquisitions or mergers 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
the following table provides information about our investment portfolio 
for investment securities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
principal amounts by expected maturity in us dollars dollars in thousands fair value at year ending year ending year ending year ending year ending december  december  december  december  december  december  cash equivalents   weighted average interest rate investments       weighted average interest rate total portfolio       weighted average interest rate foreign currency exchange 
on a global level  we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
historically  our primary exposure had been related to non us dollar denominated operating expenses in canada  and asia where we sell primarily in us dollars 
the introduction of the euro as a common currency for members of the european monetary union took place in our fiscal year to date  neither the introduction of the euro nor the effect of changes in currency exchange rates has had a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
accordingly  we have not entered into any hedging agreements 
however  we are prepared to hedge against fluctuations that the euro  or other foreign currencies  will have on foreign exchange exposure if this exposure becomes material 
as of december   the total assets related to non us dollar denominated currencies was approximately million
