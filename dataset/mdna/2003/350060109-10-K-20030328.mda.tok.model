rail products net sales declined to million from the prior year 
this decline in sales can be primarily attributed to a continued depressed market for rail distribution products and rail projects 
in addition  management s decision to sell off large quantities of used rail inventory in contributed to an increase in rail sales 
despite the unavailability of steel sheet piling from the company s supplier for most of  construction products net sales increased to million from million in the increase resulted from a strong year end backlog of fabricated bridge products and the additional backlog received with the greulich bridge products acquisition 
the company expanded its bedford  pa fabricated bridge product facility to accommodate the increase in backlog 
the start up of precast concrete building production at the company s new hillsboro  tx facility also contributed to an increase in sales 
tubular products net sales declined due primarily to lower demand for pipe coating and threaded products

management believes its internal and external sources of funds are adequate to meet anticipated needs 
dakota  minnesota and eastern railroad the company maintains a significant investment in the dakota  minnesota eastern railroad corporation dm e  a privately held  regional railroad  which controls over  miles of track in eight states 
at december   the company s investment was comprised of million of dm e common stock  million of series b preferred stock and warrants  million of series c preferred stock and warrants  million of preferred series c stock and warrants  and million of series d preferred stock and warrants 
on july   the dm e announced the acquisition of a  mile regional railroad formerly owned by the i m rail link  llc 
the company participated in the financing of this acquisition with a million investment in series d preferred stock and warrants 
on a fully diluted basis  the company s ownership of the dm e is approximately 
in addition  the company has a receivable for accrued dividend income on preferred stock of approximately million 
in june  the dm e announced its plan to build an extension from the dm e s existing line into the low sulfur coal market of the powder river basin in wyoming  and to rebuild approximately miles of its existing track the project 
the estimated cost of this project is expected to be in excess of billion 
the project received final approval by the surface transportation board stb in january litigation has been initiated appealing the stb s approval of the project 
it is expected that the appeal will be decided during the third quarter of in addition  the state of south dakota has elected to appeal a federal court decision to enjoin it from enforcing an eminent domain statute 
no time frame for a decision is yet known 
if the project proves to be viable  management believes that the value of the company s investment in the dm e could increase significantly 
if the project does not come to fruition  management believes that the value of the company s investment is supported by the dm e s existing business 
other matters specialty trackwork sales of the company s rail segment depend primarily on one supplier 
in august  the company contributed a note  having a principal and interest value of approximately million  to a limited liability company created by the company and this trackwork supplier the llc in exchange for a ownership position 
of the million initial investment  approximately million represented goodwill 
at january   the company s net equity investment in the llc  net of goodwill amortization prior to the adoption of sfas  was approximately million 
during  the company recognized an impairment loss of the entire million and wrote off this investment 
the loss in value of this investment was driven by the continued deterioration of certain rail markets and was determined to be other than temporary based on discounted cash flow projections 
equity earnings from this investment during the three years ended december   and were immaterial 
the company has historically advanced progress payments to its principal trackwork supplier for the purpose of supporting working capital requirements and funding raw material purchases and product fabrication costs for company projects 
the timing differential created by these cash flows has resulted in a significant asset related to these advances 
at december  and  the company had advanced to the llc approximately million and million  respectively 
as a result of the operating and financial issues experienced by the llc  concerns regarding the recoverability of the advances led management to conclude that a full reserve was necessary 
a charge for this reserve was recorded in the fourth quarter of the company acknowledges the risk of loss that exists relative to these advances and believes that substantial uncertainty exists relative to the company s ability to realize any measurable amounts of these advances 
during  and  the volume of business the trackwork supplier conducted with the company was approximately  million  million  and million  respectively 
the company also has approximately million of contractual supply obligations with certain customers related to specialty trackwork 
if for any reason this supplier is unable to perform  it could have a negative impact on earnings and cash flows 
operations at the company s newport  ky pipe coating facility were suspended in in response to unfavorable market conditions 
in  the company recorded an impairment loss to reduce these assets to their anticipated market value 
the anticipated sale of these assets did not materialize 
therefore  during the fourth quarter of  the company removed the held for resale designation of these assets  reclassified them as in service  and immediately recorded a million write down to reflect depreciation not recorded while under the held for resale designation 
the company s efforts to sell these assets continues 
in  the company purchased assets  primarily comprised of intellectual property related to the business of supplying rail signaling and communication devices  for approximately million 
to date  this operation foster technologies  headquartered in canada  has not generated significant revenues 
during the fourth quarter of  the company began negotiations for the sale of substantially all assets of this business 
at december   the company recorded an impairment charge of approximately million for the excess of the book value over the expected realizable value 
in february  the company sold assets related to this business for million 
the company sold all of the assets related to its st 
marys  wv mine tie operation in the fourth quarter of for million  and recorded a nominal gain on this sale 
on january   the company acquired substantially all of the equipment  inventory  intellectual property  and customer backlog of the greulich bridge products division of harsco corporation 
the purchase price of approximately million consisted of equipment of million  inventory net of trade payables of million  intangible assets of million  and goodwill of million 
these assets are being utilized in the company s fabricated bridge products operations in the construction products segment  and the results of operations of these assets have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition 
management continues to evaluate the overall performance of its operations 
a decision to down size or terminate an existing operation could have a material adverse effect on near term earnings but would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company 
outlook the company is txi chaparral s exclusive distributor of steel sheet piling 
steel sheet piling production commenced in at txi chaparral s petersburg  va facility  but the quantity produced had not materially impacted results for or in december  the company announced the availability of a full range of z pile sheet piling products 
the company expects the availability of z piling to have a positive effect on earnings for the construction products segment 
however  if txi chaparral fails to produce substantial quantities of z piling products  earnings could be adversely impacted 
the company s cxt subsidiary and allegheny rail products division are dependent on one customer  which is a class i railroad  for a significant portion of their business 
cxt has a contract with this railroad for a minimum of  concrete ties per contract year  expiring in september of the company is currently negotiating a renewal of this contract with the railroad 
if this contract is not renewed  it could have a negative impact on the operating results of the company 
in addition  a substantial portion of the company s operations is heavily dependent on governmental funding of infrastructure projects 
significant changes in the level of government funding of these projects or the failure to negotiate contract renewals could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the operating results of the company 
additionally  governmental actions concerning taxation  tariffs  the environment or other matters could impact the operating results of the company 
the company s operating results may also be affected by adverse weather conditions 
although backlog is not necessarily indicative of future operating results  total company backlog at december  was approximately million 
the following table provides the backlog by business segment december  in thousands backlog rail products    construction products    tubular products    total backlog    the reduction in rail segment backlog reflects the weakness in the current rail market as well as the absence of firm renewal commitments on contracts under negotiation 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  management selects the principle or method that is appropriate in the company s specific circumstance 
application of these accounting principles requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the following critical accounting policies related to the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
asset impairment the company is required to test for asset impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
the company applies statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired 
this statement indicates that if the sum of the future expected cash flows associated with an asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying value  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to an asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate as it is highly susceptible to change from period to period  because it requires management to make assumptions about cash flows over future years 
these assumptions impact the amount of an impairment  which would have an impact on the income statement 
management s assumptions about future cash flows require significant judgment because actual operating levels have fluctuated in the past and are expected to do so in the future 
during the fourth quarter of  as a result of an ongoing evaluation of foster technologies  the company s rail signaling and communication device business  the company determined that it would pursue a potential sale of the business technology and long lived assets 
utilizing a negotiated sales price as an indicator of fair market value for these assets  the company determined that an impairment of million was required and recorded this charge in the fourth quarter of goodwill beginning in fiscal year  goodwill is required to be evaluated annually for impairment  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas 
sfas requires a two step process be performed to analyze whether or not goodwill has been impaired 
step one is to test for potential impairment  which requires that the fair value of the reporting unit be compared to its book value 
if the fair value is higher than the book value  no impairment occurs 
if the fair value is lower than the book value  step two must be performed 
step two requires measurement of the amount of impairment loss  if any  and requires that a hypothetical purchase price allocation be done to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
the resulting fair value is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is lower than the carrying value of the goodwill  an impairment must be recorded 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the discounted cash flow can change from period to period and these changes could cause a material impact to the income statement 
management s assumptions about discount rates  inflation rates and other internal and external economic conditions  such as expected growth rate  require significant judgment regarding fluctuating rates and anticipated future revenues 
additionally  sfas requires that the goodwill be analyzed for impairment on an annual basis using the assumptions that apply at the time the analysis is updated 
as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  goodwill recorded in the company s rail and construction segments was analyzed for impairment with the implementation of sfas the fair value of the goodwill associated with these segments was estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies and market comparable information 
based on the analysis  the implied fair value of the goodwill for certain product groups within these segments was less than the book value recorded for the goodwill 
therefore  the company recognized a pretax impairment charge of million  representing a complete write off of goodwill for those product groups for which an impairment was determined to exist 
in the fourth quarter of  the company performed the required annual impairment test of the carrying amount of goodwill for the product groups and concluded that no further impairment was required 
prior to the adoption of sfas  the company assessed the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value might not be recoverable 
no such events or indicators occurred  as prescribed by previous accounting guidance  which required the company to perform such an assessment 
allowance for bad debts the company s operating segments encounter risks associated with the collection of accounts receivable 
as such  the company records a monthly provision for accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision  the company reviews its accounts receivable aging and calculates an allowance through application of historic reserve factors to overdue receivables 
this calculation is supplemented by specific account reviews performed by the company s credit department 
as necessary  the application of the company s allowance rates to specific customers are reviewed and adjusted to more accurately reflect the credit risk inherent within that customer relationship 
the reserve is reviewed for reasonableness on a monthly basis 
an account receivable is written off against the allowance when management determines it is uncollectible 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for bad debts is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and the allowance could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement and working capital 
specific customer circumstances and general economic conditions may vary significantly from management s assumptions and may impact expected earnings 
at december   the company maintained an allowance for bad debts of million  and  for the year ended december   the company recognized bad debt expense of million 
pension plans the calculation of the company s net periodic benefit cost pension expense and benefit obligation pension liability associated with its defined benefit pension plans pension plans requires the use of a number of assumptions that the company deems to be critical accounting estimates 
changes in these assumptions can result in different pension expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ significantly from the assumptions 
the company believes that the two most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
the expected long term rate of return reflects the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plans to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability 
the company establishes the expected long term rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to the company at that time  including the plan s investment mix and the forecasted rates of return on these types of securities 
any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss 
the unrecognized actuarial gains or losses are amortized in accordance with statement no 
although the long term rate is intended to be fairly consistent  the company has reevaluated and reduced the rate in the expected long term rates of return determined by the company for and were and  respectively 
pension expense increases as the expected long term rate of return decreases 
therefore  the decline in this assumption had the effect of increasing the company s pension obligation and future pension expense 
the assumed discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension benefits could effectively be settled 
in estimating that rate  statement no 
requires the company look to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments 
the company discounted its future pension liabilities using rates of and as of december  and  respectively 
the company s pension liability increases as the discount rate is reduced 
therefore  the decline in this assumption had the effect of increasing the company s pension obligation and future pension expense 
deferred tax assets the recognition of deferred tax assets requires management to make judgments regarding the future realization of these assets 
as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  valuation allowances must be provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than percent that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
sfas requires management to evaluate positive and negative evidence regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
determination of whether the positive evidence outweighs the negative and quantification of the valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and judgments of future financial results 
the company believes that these estimates and judgments are critical accounting estimates 
cumulative losses in recent periods and other negative evidence further complicate these assessments 
the company s financial results in recent periods have generated operating loss carryforwards  particularly with regard to the operations of the company s discontinued foreign operation  foster technologies 
management has determined that it is more likely than not that the company may not realize a portion of the deferred tax assets generated by these losses 
therefore  the company has provided a valuation allowance for this deferred tax asset 
at december   the company maintained net operating loss carryforwards and a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively 
see note income taxes 
the company s future ability to realize the tax benefit from these net operating loss carryforwards may affect the company s reported income tax expense benefit and net income 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas provides accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets 
the obligations affected are those for which there is a legal obligation to settle as a result of existing or enacted law 
the company does not believe this standard will impact its consolidated financial statements 
in august the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this statement supersedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  and provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of 
on january   the company adopted sfas and the adoption did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
this statement supercedes eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  rather than at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the company does not expect this standard to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  and interpretation of arb no 
 fin 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  management is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin will have on its results of operations and financial condition 
the company has not identified any off balance sheet arrangements for which consolidation under fin is reasonably possible 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk 
market risk and risk management policies the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate exposure on variable rate debt  primarily by using interest rate collars and variable interest rate swaps 
effective september   in conjunction with the company s debt refinancing  the company discontinued cash flow hedge accounting treatment for its interest rate collars and recorded a cumulative charge to reflect mark to market accounting 
the application of mark to market accounting for the year ended december  has resulted in the recognition of a non cash charge of million which is recorded in other expense income on the consolidated statements of operations 
the company continues to apply cash flow hedge accounting to its other interest rate swap 
the company recognizes all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value 
fluctuations in the fair values of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  and reclassified into earnings as the underlying hedged items affect earnings 
to the extent that a change in interest rate derivative does not perfectly offset the change in value of the interest rate being hedged  the ineffective portion is recognized in earnings immediately 
the company attempts to maintain a reasonable balance between fixed rate and floating rate debt to keep financing costs as low as possible 
the company s primary source of variable rate debt comes from its revolving credit agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company had approximately million of floating rate debt outstanding under this agreement with an average interest rate of approximately 
while not specifically correlated with the revolving credit agreement  the company maintains an economic hedge of this variable rate through the maintenance of two interest rate collar agreements with a weighted average minimum annual interest rate of to a maximum weighted average annual interest rate of see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in note  these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting  as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
since the interest rate on this debt floats with the short term market rate of interest  the company is exposed to the risk that these interest rates may decrease below the minimum annual interest rates on the two interest rate collar agreements 
the effect of a percent decrease in rate of interest below the weighted average minimum annual interest rate on million of outstanding floating rate debt would result in increased annual interest costs of approximately million 
the company is not subject to significant exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates
