sophisticated store level information and distribution systems 
in recent years  we have made significant investments in sophisticated store level information systems and warehouse and distribution systems  in order to more effectively manage our inventory and increase the availability of products to our customers 
our sophisticated inventory management systems provide inventory movement forecasting based on history  trend and seasonality 
our systems have enhanced our ability to predict the size and timing of product requirements by closely monitoring service level goals  vendor lead times and cost of inventory assumptions 
our store level replenishment system generates orders based upon store on hand and store model stock quantities 
store model stock quantities are determined by an automatic model stock adjustment system  which utilizes historical sales patterns  seasonality and store presentation requirements 
we also maintain a store specific precision pricing program that seeks to optimize margins while maintaining price competitiveness 
our fully integrated warehouse and distribution network and our strategically located depots  which operate using state of the art technology  have allowed us to significantly improve distribution efficiency 
additionally  these investments have allowed us to both improve our in stock inventory levels and reduce delivery costs and times for products 
business strategy our business strategy includes the following key elements drive customer traffic and increase sales base

this initiative enables us to establish pricing levels at each store based upon that store s local market competition 
our entry level products offer excellent value by meeting standard quality requirements at low prices 
in addition  our sales associates are encouraged to offer alternative products at slightly higher price points 
these products typically provide extra features  improved performance  an enhanced warranty  or are nationally branded items

by leveraging our existing store network  we believe we can increase store operating profits as we expand our difm sales 
maximize customer satisfaction 
we aim to provide the highest level of customer service in our industry to generate repeat business 
we attempt to achieve this goal by staffing our stores with well trained associates  including an average of two ase certified technicians per store  which allows us to provide high quality diagnostic support 
another integral part of our focus on customer satisfaction includes utilizing our sophisticated product distribution and store level systems to provide our customers with a broad selection of parts and accessories on a timely basis 
improve profitability and cash flow 
we continually review our operations in order to ensure that we are optimally allocating our resources and have an appropriate cost structure that will enable us to grow our net sales  profitability  and free cash flow 
store operations our stores are divided into eight geographic regions southwest  rocky mountain  northwest  northern plains  southern california  coastal california  los angeles  and northern california 
each region is administered by a regional manager  each of whom oversees seven to eleven district managers 
each of our district managers has responsibility for between and stores 
the table below sets forth  as of february   the geographic distribution of our stores and the trade names under which they operated 
checker schucks kragen company auto parts auto supply auto parts total california washington arizona colorado minnesota oregon utah nevada wisconsin idaho new mexico texas alaska montana wyoming hawaii north dakota south dakota michigan total our stores are generally open seven days a week  with hours from am to am am to am on sundays

the stores  which range in size from  to  square feet  average approximately  square feet in size and offer a store specific mix of between  and  skus 
we have three prototype store designs  which are   and  square feet in size

real estate strategy our real estate strategy is focused on our existing or contiguous markets and includes opening new stores  relocating under performing stores with expiring leases to better locations  and expanding selected stores 
our market strategy group  which is a part of our real estate department  utilizes a sophisticated  market based approach that identifies and analyzes potential store locations based on detailed demographic and competitive studies 
these demographic and competitive studies include analysis of population density  growth patterns  age  per capita income  vehicle traffic counts and the number and type of existing automotive related facilities  such as automotive parts stores and other competitors within a pre determined radius of the potential new location 
these potential locations are compared to our existing locations to determine opportunities for opening new stores and relocating or expanding existing stores 
the following table sets forth our store development activities during the periods indicated fiscal year beginning stores new stores relocated stores acquired stores closed stores including relocated stores ending stores expanded stores total new  relocated and expanded stores we expect to open  relocate or expand approximately to stores in fiscal 
table of contents store merchandising our store merchandising program  which classifies our product mix into separate categories  is designed to determine the optimal inventory mix at each individual store based on that stores historical sales 
we believe that we can improve store sales  gross profit margin and inventory turnover by tailoring individual store inventory mix based on historical sales patterns for each of the product categories 
as part of our profitability enhancement program pep in fiscal  we completed a comprehensive review of slower selling items that met neither current return criteria nor our objective for inventory turns 
this review resulted in the elimination of certain merchandise  and the transfer of certain goods to stores that turn the merchandise satisfactorily 
purchasing merchandise is selected from over suppliers and purchased for all stores by personnel at our corporate headquarters in phoenix  arizona 
no one class of product and no single supplier accounted for as much as of our purchases in fiscal our inventory management systems include the e trim buying system  which provides inventory movement forecasting based upon history  trend and seasonality 
combined with service level goals  vendor lead times and cost of inventory assumptions  the e trim buying system determines the timing and size of purchase orders 
approximately of the dollar value of transactions are sent via electronic data interchange  with the remainder being sent by a computer facsimile interface 
our store replenishment system generates orders based upon store on hand and store model stock 
this includes an automatic model stock adjustment system utilizing historical sales  seasonality and store presentation requirements 
we also can allocate seasonal and promotional merchandise based upon a stores history of prior promotional and seasonal sales 
our stores offer products with nationally recognized  well advertised brand names  such as armor all  autolite  castrol  dayco  exide  fel pro  fram  havoline  mobil  monroe  pennzoil  prestone  quaker state  raybestos  stant  sylvania  turtle wax and valvoline 
in addition to brand name products  our stores carry a wide variety of high quality generic products 
because most of our generic products are produced by nationally recognized manufacturers that produce similar brand name products that enjoy a high degree of consumer acceptance  we believe that our generic products are of a quality that is comparable to such brand name products 
commercial sales program in addition to our primary focus on serving the do it yourself consumer  we have significantly increased our marketing directed at the commercial or difm customer in the automotive replacement parts market 
the commercial or difm market constitutes in excess of of the annual sales in the automotive aftermarket and is currently growing at a faster rate than the do it yourself market 
our commercial sales program  which is intended to facilitate penetration of this market  is targeted toward professional mechanics  auto repair shops  auto dealers  fleet owners  mass and general merchandisers with auto repair facilities and other commercial repair outlets located near our stores 
we have made a significant commitment to this portion of our business and upgraded the information systems capabilities available to the commercial sales group 
in addition  we employ one district sales manager for approximately every five stores with a commercial sales center 
this district sales manager is responsible for servicing existing commercial accounts and developing new commercial accounts 
in addition  at a minimum  each commercial sales center has a dedicated in store salesperson  driver and delivery vehicle 
we believe we are well positioned to effectively and profitably service commercial customers  who typically require a higher level of customer service and broad product availability 
the commercial market has traditionally been serviced primarily by jobbers 
recently  however  automotive specialty retailing chains  such as our company  have entered the commercial market 
the chains typically have multiple locations in given market areas and maintain a broad inventory selection 
we believe we have significant competitive advantages

many of our current associates have passed the ase p test  a nationally recognized certification for auto parts technicians 
competition we compete in both the diy and difm markets of the automotive aftermarket industry  which is highly fragmented and generally very competitive 
we compete primarily with national and regional retail automotive parts chains such as autozone  inc and the pep boys manny  moe and jack  inc  wholesalers or jobber stores some of which are associated with national automotive parts distributors or associations  such as napa  automobile dealers  and discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive replacement parts  maintenance items and accessories such as wal mart stores  inc

this stipulation and order has been signed by the court and we have paid the full settlement amount due to the plaintiffs 
we currently and from time to time are involved in other litigation incidental to the conduct of our business  including asbestos and similar product liability claims  slip and fall and other general liability claims  discrimination and employment claims  vendor disputes  and miscellaneous environmental and real estate claims

environmental matters we are subject to various federal  state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business  including those governing the handling  storage and disposal of hazardous substances  the recycling of batteries and used lubricants  and the ownership and operation of real property

such laws often impose joint and several liability and liability may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the release of such hazardous substances 
we have recorded no liabilities to provide for the cost of environmental remediation activities  as we do not believe that we have incurred any such liabilities pursuant to the existing accounting literature 
at some of our acquired locations  automobiles are serviced in automotive service facilities that we sublease to third parties 
as a result of investigations undertaken in connection with such acquisitions  we are aware that soil or groundwater may be contaminated at some of these properties 
although there can be no assurance  based on current information and  in some cases  indemnities we obtained from the former operators of these facilities  we believe that any such contamination will not result in any liabilities that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
as part of our operations  we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with  for example  our oil recycling program 
we currently provide a recycling program for batteries and for the collection of used lubricants at certain of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third party vendors 
the batteries and used lubricants are collected by our associates  deposited into vendor supplied containers pallets and then disposed of by the third party vendors 
in general  our agreements with such vendors contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination that may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to off site properties including as a result of waste disposal and to our properties  when caused by the vendor 
we do not believe that compliance with environmental laws and regulations has had a material impact on our operations to date  but there can be no assurance that future compliance with such laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our fiscal year ends on the sunday nearest to january and is named for the calendar year just ended 
occasionally this results in a fiscal year that is weeks long 
when we refer to a particular fiscal year we mean the following fiscal means the weeks ended february   fiscal means the weeks ended february   and fiscal means the weeks ended february  general csk auto corporation is the largest specialty retailer of automotive parts and accessories in the western united states and one of the largest retailers of these products in the united states based  in each case  on our number of stores 
as of february   we operated  stores under one fully integrated operating format and three brand names checker auto parts  founded in  with stores in the southwestern  rocky mountain and northern plains states and hawaii  schucks auto supply  founded in  with stores in the pacific northwest and alaska  and kragen auto parts  founded in  with stores primarily in california 
the discussion that follows includes several references to charges and effects relating to the following significant transactions that occurred during the period covered on july   we sold approximately million shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering at per share 
in addition  a selling stockholder sold approximately million shares in this offering and  together with other affiliated stockholders  this stockholder group sold their remaining approximately million shares on november  these transactions are referred to collectively as the secondary offerings 
in august  we initiated a refinancing of our capital structure that included the issuance of convertible notes  convertible debentures  a refinancing of our credit facility and the issuance of additional stock 
we refer to this as our refinancing 
in july  we implemented a profitability enhancement program to reduce costs  improve operating efficiencies and close under performing stores 
we refer to this as our pep 
in april  we acquired allcar stores the allcar stores and in we acquired al s and grand auto supply stores the aga stores and big wheel rossi stores the big wheel stores 
we refer to these transactions collectively as the acquisitions 
in march  we participated in the formation of a new joint venture  partsamerica

this joint venture terminated in the second quarter of fiscal 
table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth our statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year net sales cost of sales gross profit operating and administrative expenses store closing costs and other restructuring costs legal settlement goodwill amortization operating profit interest expense equity in loss of joint venture income loss before income taxes and extraordinary loss income tax expense benefit income loss before extraordinary loss extraordinary loss  net of income taxes net income loss net sales net sales and sales data for the prior three years were as follows sales in thousands net sales sales data retail sales commercial sales other sales net sales for weeks impact of rd week in fiscal total net sales sales growth all stores weeks sales growth comparable stores sales growth commercial sales weeks number of stores open at end of year net sales include the results of all stores from the date opened or acquired 
we also evaluate results for comparable or same store sales 
comparable store net sales data is calculated based on the change in net sales commencing after the time a new or acquired store has been open for twelve months 
therefore  sales for the first twelve months a new or acquired store is open are not included in the comparable store calculation 
stores that have been relocated are included in comparable store sales 
to evaluate sales levels  we have identified the net sales for the rd week in for comparison purposes so as to evaluate consistent week fiscal periods across all fiscal years presented 
net sales for all stores and comparable stores increased significantly in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to our improved liquidity which allowed us to replenish our store inventories to more 
table of contents normal levels of product availability  the commencement of a new merchandising program that features garage maintenance and organizational products  and an increased emphasis on promotional activities and promotional pricing to stimulate customer awareness and improve customer counts in our stores 
total commercial sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal retail sales growth was flat in fiscal compared to fiscal and comparable store sales increased over the same period 
excluding the rd week in  commercial sales for all stores and for comparable stores increased and  respectively  in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase resulted from the continued expansion of our commercial sales program 
gross profit gross profit consists primarily of net sales less the cost of sales and warehouse and distribution expenses 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by variations in our product mix  price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs and vendor programs 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal gross profit increased in fiscal over fiscal due to increased cash discounts and vendor allowances as a result of our improved sales volume and liquidity 
as a result of the lifo method of accounting for inventory and the ability to obtain lower product acquisition costs  we recorded reductions to cost of goods sold of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
in addition  gross profit in fiscal was negatively impacted by million of charges incurred relating to our pep 
gross profit in fiscal was million  or of nets sales  compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal gross profit decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of our pep  in which million of charges were incurred relating to reduction in inventory values and costs associated with inventory review and disposal 
as a result of the lifo method of accounting for inventory and the ability to obtain lower product acquisition costs  we recorded reductions to cost of goods sold of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
although we had anticipated higher gross profit levels for  we did not achieve this result because of lower than expected vendor volume purchase allowances and cash discounts during the year due principally to lower than typical in stock inventory levels in the period 
we have historically utilized prompt payment and other cash discount programs offered by vendors 
because of the need to pay for the class action lawsuit settlement see note to the consolidated financial statements and the term loan amortization payments  we made efforts to retain cash during most of fiscal and did not take full advantage of the contractual vendor allowances 
in addition  our change of advertising strategy to emphasize promotional discounts through newspaper advertising to increase retail customer count resulted in a reduction to the realized gross profit margin during the period 
operating and administrative expenses operating expenses consist of operating and administrative expenses and also include the costs of store closing and restructuring costs including the pep  legal settlements  and goodwill amortization in fiscal years prior to 
operating and administrative expenses are comprised of store payroll  store occupancy  advertising expenses  other store expenses and general and administrative expenses  including salaries and related benefits of corporate employees  administrative office occupancy expenses  data processing  professional expenses and other related expenses 
operating expenses decreased by approximately million to million  or of net sales  in fiscal from million  or of net sales  in fiscal operating expenses have decreased as a percent of sales as a result of cost reductions associated with our pep and the elimination of goodwill amortization during fiscal operating expenses have also decreased as a percent of sales due  in part  to 
table of contents the leveraging of our fixed costs over rising net sales 
in addition  the following items impacted the comparability of fiscal operating expenses a charge for workers compensation of approximately million reflecting increased loss reserves for claims incurred during plan years through and claims relating to the acquired paccar stores  in response to increasing medical and claims costs  primarily in california 
closed store charges of million due to revisions in reserves  primarily for the pep stores  relating to longer than anticipated vacancy periods and lower estimated sublease rates as a result of the economic slowdown 
operating expenses decreased by million to million  or of net sales  for fiscal from million  or of net sales  for fiscal the following items impacted the comparability of operating expenses for the fiscal years indicated implementation of our pep to reduce costs  improve operating efficiencies and close under performing stores which included approximately million of store closing and restructuring charges and million of other adjustments to prior estimates affecting the closed store reserve that were unrelated to the pep 
the sale of certain of our stores that we had planned to close as part of the pep 
we had expected to leave the stores vacant and incur rents through the expiration of the contracted leases  or to incur rental costs while negotiating with potential subtenants 
the costs were no longer required as we sold the stores and transferred the leases to the new owner 
results of operations in fiscal reflect a reduction in expenses of million resulting from this transaction 
settlement of two separate but similar lawsuits 
the lawsuits sought overtime pay for personnel that we had believed were exempt from overtime because they were part of our store management 
our operating results reflect the costs of settlement of million and million 
we have changed the manner in which we compensate certain members of our store management to avoid similar litigation in future periods 
over the past several years  we have completed a series of acquisitions 
upon completion of each acquisition  we incurred direct and incremental expenses for the transition of acquired stores to our operating format 
these expenses included the cost of re merchandising acquired inventories  training employees  grand opening advertising to generate name brand awareness in new markets and other expenses 
these expenses were typically incurred for a period of approximately six months following the acquisition  and totaled million and million 
we incurred charges of million relating to a loss on disposition of certain fixed assets in fiscal two of our commercial customers declared bankruptcy  requiring us to provide discrete provisions for bad debts of million in and million in in connection with the acquisitions  we identified certain stores in our existing chain for closure because they overlapped with better situated acquired stores 
we incurred related charges of million in fiscal we routinely incur other store closing costs  but have not identified these costs as special items because they are incurred in the normal course of updating and relocating stores to improve our business 
interest expense interest expense for fiscal increased to million from million for the comparable period of fiscal higher average interest rates  primarily on our fixed rated debt  and increased amortization of deferred financing fees as a result of our refinancing increased interest expense 
these increases were partially offset by reduced interest expense associated with lower average outstanding debt balances and less vendor interest on accounts payables because of our improved liquidity in fiscal during february  we 
table of contents entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert the interest rate payment obligation on million of our senior notes to a floating rate  set quarterly  equal to the month libor rate plus basis points 
for fiscal  we reduced interest expense by approximately million as a result of the interest rate swap 
net interest expense for fiscal totaled million compared to million for the weeks of fiscal interest expense decreased as a result of lower average interest rates and the fact that there was one less week in fiscal weeks relative to fiscal weeks 
these decreases were partially offset by higher interest expense in fiscal due to higher average outstanding loan balances and increased amortization of deferred financing fees as a result of our refinancing 
due to our liquidity issues during the year  we incurred vendor interest on accounts payable because we extended merchandise payment terms 
income tax expense income tax expense for fiscal was million or 
the effective tax rate in fiscal is lower than the effective benefit rate in the prior year due to the impact of state tax credits applied to our statutory rate in a year with a loss before income taxes 
income tax benefit for fiscal was million  reflecting the loss we incurred  compared to income tax expense of million for the fiscal period 
our effective tax rate was during fiscal our effective tax rate of in fiscal was not representative of our typical rate as a result of certain permanent items and tax credits that were relatively higher in proportion to our income before income taxes than in other years 
the rate also decreased in as a result of a reversal of prior reserves no longer required 
profitability enhancement program pep during the second quarter of fiscal  we implemented our pep to reduce costs  improve operating efficiencies and close under performing stores 
as a result of the pep  we recorded total restructuring and other charges of million  which are detailed in the following paragraphs 
the table below summarizes the charges relating to the pep amounts recorded as store closing and restructuring charges reserve for store closing costs write down for impairment of store site costs and store related property and equipment reserve for workforce reduction other total amounts recorded as charges to cost of sales provision for excess inventories actual costs incurred for inventory review and disposal total grand total store closing costs under the pep  we increased the store closing reserve by approximately million 
approximately million of the charge related to the planned closure of stores based on several factors including market saturation  store profitability  and store size and format 
of these planned closures  were closed as of february  and charges relating to of the stores were subsequently eliminated from the reserve upon the sale of these stores and the transfer of the lease commitments to the new owner 
in addition  we recorded an increase to the reserve for prior years plans of approximately million relating to existing closed stores 
table of contents that had longer than anticipated vacancy periods as a result of the continued economic slowdown 
the pep charge also includes a million write down for impairment of leasehold improvements and other store related property and equipment  which has been recorded as a direct reduction of net property and equipment balances 
see store closures in a subsequent section of this management discussion and analysis of financial condition for further discussion regarding the events and decisions made that result in strategic store closing plans and the related impact on our results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
other profitability enhancement program costs as a result of the consolidation of certain regional operations and general and administrative functions under our pep  we terminated employees and eliminated open positions 
the terminated employees worked primarily in human resources  information technology and real estate 
as a result of these actions  the restructuring charges included a provision for severance and benefits of approximately million 
we have also accrued other costs and charges incidental to the restructuring 
these costs include early termination fees for operating lease commitments and other asset impairments aggregating approximately million 
inventory and related charges we completed an inventory review to increase inventory turnover  provide an optimal inventory level at each store location  liquidate inventory not meeting our new asset return levels  and write down the carrying value of inventory relating to the stores planned for closure 
as a result of the analysis  we elected to establish a reserve for excess inventories resulting from the decision to eliminate certain product lines and to liquidate inventory from closed stores 
in conjunction with this decision  a provision of million was recorded to reduce inventory values 
in addition  we incurred actual costs of approximately million related to labor  warehouse and distribution  freight and other operating costs associated with the inventory review and disposal 
these costs are reflected as cost of sales in the accompanying statement of operations for fiscal impact of the pep based on the initiatives described above  the pep reduced fiscal operating expenses by approximately million  which related to the reduction of certain personnel  communications and transportation costs 
we anticipate that these cost savings will be applicable to future years as well 
in addition  the stores closed as a result of the pep incurred operating losses of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
certain of these stores incurred operating losses during fiscal as a result of the respective stores remaining open for a portion of the year 
all stores were closed prior to the end of fiscal liquidity and capital resources overview of liquidity our primary cash requirements include working capital primarily inventory  interest on our debt and capital expenditures 
we are not required to make any debt amortization payments prior to december other than for capital leases 
we intend to finance our cash requirements with cash flow from operations  borrowings under our senior credit facility and short term trade credit relating to extended payment terms for inventory purchases 
the following table outlines our working capital and liquidity in thousands as of year end net current assets cash availability under revolving line of credit total liquidity 
table of contents as of february   we had net working capital of approximately million  an increase of million  or  compared to february  working capital increased primarily due to a million increase in inventories consistent with our return to a more normal inventory in stock position and the acquisition of new product types in support of new merchandise programs  and a million increase in receivables primarily as a result of new vendor rebate and cooperative advertising programs 
these increases were partially offset by working capital decreases from a million increase in accounts payable relating to the increased inventory purchases and extended payment terms  an million change in net current deferred income taxes primarily as a result of inventory valuation differences  and an million increase in accrued payroll related expenses primarily as a result of increased workers compensation reserves 
as of february   we had total liquidity cash plus availability under our existing revolving credit facility of approximately million 
availability under our revolving credit agreement is controlled by borrowing base limitations applicable to that facility 
the borrowing base formula is equal to the lesser of million or the sum of certain percentages of our eligible inventory and accounts receivable 
as a result of the limitations imposed by the borrowing base formula  at february   we could only borrow up to million of the total million facility 
accordingly  we have million of additional borrowing capacity that has not been included in our liquidity calculation  but that may become available in the future  subject to the borrowing base calculation 
debt is an important part of our overall capitalization 
while we are still highly leveraged  our debt to equity ratio continues to improve 
our ratio has decreased as a result of our conversion of million in outstanding convertible subordinated debentures to common stock  our july stock offering and the subsequent retirement of approximately million of outstanding senior subordinated notes 
the table below details our debt to equity ratio in thousands as of year end debt  including capital lease obligations equity debt to equity ratio analysis of cash flows operating activities during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million of cash used in operating activities during fiscal the significant components of the change are net income for fiscal of million compared to a loss of million in the fiscal period  which is partially offset by million of non cash inventory and fixed asset charges during the period as a result of our pep  a reduction in cash used to support working capital as discussed above and net changes in other assets and liabilities  whereby million was used during fiscal compared to million during fiscal  a million premium payment made during fiscal as part of our retirement of million of outstanding senior subordinated notes  and an million payment made during fiscal as a result of our settlement of the class action lawsuits see note to the consolidated financial statements

table of contents during fiscal compared to million during fiscal  and the payment during fiscal with respect to the class action lawsuits described above 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities totaled million for fiscal compared to million used in investing activities during fiscal the decrease in cash used in investing activities during fiscal was the result of million in proceeds from the sale of stores in west texas in fiscal no such sale occurred in fiscal  and million less in capital expenditures in fiscal than in the comparable period 
these sources of cash were offset in part by million less in proceeds from assets held for sale in fiscal net cash used in investing activities totaled million for fiscal compared to million used in investing activities during fiscal the decrease in cash used in investing activities for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily the result of million less in capital expenditures 
we invested a greater amount in fiscal as part of the transition and integration of our acquisitions 
in addition  during fiscal we made a million investment in pa 
we did not make any acquisitions during fiscal or nor do we anticipate any significant acquisitions during fiscal we have budgeted approximately million for capital expenditures for fiscal  primarily for new stores and general corporate purposes 
we opened new  relocated or expanded stores in fiscal and expect to open  relocate or expand approximately to stores in fiscal we anticipate that the majority of these stores will be financed under arrangements structured as operating leases that require minimal capital expenditures for fixtures and store equipment 
for the remainder of our planned new  relocated or expanded stores  we expect to spend approximately  per store for leasehold improvements 
in addition to capital expenditures  each new store  except for relocated stores  will require an estimated investment in working capital  principally for inventories  of approximately  financing activities during fiscal  we completed a refinancing of our capital structure that resulted in the elimination of scheduled bank debt amortization payments prior to the end of  the extension of debt maturities and enhanced liquidity 
the refinancing consisted of the following the issuance of a million  convertible subordinated note  which was converted during fiscal into approximately million shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  a new three year million senior secured  asset based credit facility due in december comprised of a million non amortizing term loan and a million revolving credit facility  the issuance of million of senior notes  and the issuance of million of convertible subordinated debentures  which were converted at our election on may  into approximately million shares of our common stock at the conversion price of per share 
to continue to reduce debt and improve liquidity  on july   we sold approximately million shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering at per share 
proceeds from this offering were used to retire approximately million of our outstanding senior subordinated notes 
the early extinguishment of this debt resulted in an extraordinary loss of approximately million  net of approximately million of income tax benefit  primarily as a result of the payment of an early redemption 
table of contents premium and the write off of deferred debt issuance costs 
the sources and uses of funds of this transaction are as follows in thousands proceeds gross proceeds at per share underwriting discount net proceeds uses partial retirement of senior subordinated notes redemption premium on retired notes charged to extraordinary loss accrued interest on retired notes issuance costs general corporate purposes total use of funds net cash used in financing activities totaled million for fiscal compared to million provided by financing activities in fiscal our secondary offering in july provided the largest component of our financing cash flows during fiscal  while our refinancing provided the largest component during fiscal see table below 
in addition  the net payments made on our revolving credit facility during fiscal were million more than fiscal excluding the impact of the refinancing  resulting from our improved liquidity 
the following table highlights the components of our refinancing and its effect on our financing activities for fiscal in thousands non refinancing refinancing activity total borrowings under senior credit facility payments under senior credit facility payment of debt issuance costs issuance of convertible subordinated notes in august issuance of convertible subordinated debentures in december borrowings under senior notes payments on capital lease obligations recovery of stockholder receivable exercise of stock options other financing activities net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities totaled million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal summarized in the table above  our refinancing generated million in net financing cash inflows as compared to a net cash outflow of million relating to other financing activities 
the decrease in cash flows relating to other financing activities as compared to fiscal primarily relates to net payments on the senior credit facility during fiscal of million as compared to million of net borrowings on the senior credit facility during fiscal 
table of contents operating lease arrangements and contractual obligations we lease our office and warehouse facilities  all but one of our retail stores  and a majority of our equipment 
certain of the equipment leases are classified as capital leases and  accordingly  the equipment and related obligation are recorded on our balance sheet 
however  substantially all of our store leases are operating leases with private landlords and provide for monthly rental payments based on a contractual amount 
the majority of these lease agreements are for base lease periods ranging from to years  with three to five renewal options of five years each 
certain store leases also provide for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of sales in excess of a stipulated minimum 
we believe that the long duration of our store leases offer security for our store locations without the risks associated with real estate ownership 
we currently have leases for our corporate headquarters and an adjacent parking lot with a landlord which until november was a related party 
previously we had entered into sale leaseback or other financing arrangements with related parties 
we believe that the terms of the transactions with the related parties were no less favorable than terms we may have been able to receive from independent third parties at the time of the applicable transaction 
we also believe that these transactions as a whole are not material to our financial statements 
for more information on related party transactions  refer to note of the consolidated financial statements 
historically  we had an arrangement with a real estate investment company  under which we would identify a location for a new store and then that company would acquire the property 
we would then build our new store and lease the store from the real estate investment company under an operating lease 
this arrangement expired on december  during fiscal  two stores  which were previously committed under this facility  were funded 
we do not plan to negotiate another similar facility and do not believe that such a lease facility is critical to our store development plans for fiscal based on the limited number of projected store openings and the availability of other alternative financing arrangements  including sale leaseback financing transactions directly with individual investors 
we funded our new and relocated stores during fiscal under separate agreements with landlords and individual investors 
in order to facilitate an understanding of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  the following data is provided in thousands payments due by period within after total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total contractual obligations operating lease obligations are not offset by obligations of subtenants 
other commercial commitments consist of standby letters of credit totaling approximately million  all of which expire in store closures we provide an allowance for estimated costs and losses to be incurred in connection with store closures 
on an on going basis  store locations are reviewed and analyzed based on several factors including market saturation  store profitability  and store size and format 
in addition  we analyze sales trends and geographical and competitive factors to determine the viability and future profitability of our store locations 
if a store location does not meet our required projections  it is designated for closure 
as a result of our acquisitions over the last several years  we have closed numerous locations as a result of store overlap with previously existing store locations 

table of contents the allowance for store closing costs is included in accrued expenses and other long term liabilities in the accompanying financial statements and primarily consists of three components future rents to be paid over the remaining terms of the lease agreements for the stores net of estimated probable sublease recoveries  lease commissions associated with the anticipated store subleases  and occupancy expenses associated with the closed store vacancy periods 
prior to january   such costs were recognized when a store was specifically identified  costs could be estimated and closure was planned to be completed within the next twelve months 
no provision was made for employee termination costs 
for stores to be relocated  such costs were recognized when an agreement for the new location had been reached with a landlord and site plans met preliminary municipal approvals 
during the period that they remained open for business  the rent and other operating expenses for the stores to be closed continued to be reflected in normal operating expenses 
in july  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize the present value of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by the standard include lease rental and termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  store closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
sfas no 
is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december   with early implementation encouraged 
we did not incur any new liability related to a store closure between adoption of this statement and the end of our fiscal year 
the adoption of this pronouncement will impact the timing of recognition of future closed store charges  which will be recorded at fair value when a store is vacated 
as of february   we had a total of store locations included in the allowance for store closing costs 
of this total  locations were vacant  locations were subleased and locations were identified for closure but remained open as of year end 
in addition to these stores  we had service centers of which was vacant and were subleased 
future rents will be incurred through the expiration of the non cancelable leases  the longest of which runs through march activity in the provision for store closings and the related store closing costs for the three fiscal years ended february   including the pep  is as follows in thousands fiscal year balance  beginning of year store closing costs store closing costs  gross adjustments to prior plans revisions in estimates store closing costs  net purchase accounting adjustments als and grand auto supply total purchase accounting adjustments payments rent expense  net of sublease recoveries occupancy and other expenses sublease commissions and buyouts total payments balance  end of year 
table of contents during fiscal  we recorded the following gross store closing costs of million relating to the identification of stores for closure  an adjustment to prior plans of million primarily due to management s decision to utilize a warehouse and storage facility that was previously included within the plan year accrual in conjunction with purchase accounting adjustments as a result of our acquisitions  and revisions in estimates of million million for plan year  million for plan year and million for plan years prior to relating to existing closed stores that have had longer than anticipated vacancy periods as a result of the continued economic slowdown 
during fiscal  we recorded the following gross store closing costs of million million from the pep relating to the identification of stores for closure  an adjustment to prior plans of million due to two stores previously identified for closure under our pep that were subsequently removed as they were sold and the lease commitment was transferred to the new owner  and revisions in estimates of million million for plan year  million for plan year and million for plan years prior to relating to existing closed stores that have had longer than anticipated vacancy periods as a result of the economic slowdown 
during fiscal  we recorded the following gross store closing costs of million relating to the identification of stores for closure million of which relates to a closure plan for current stores that overlapped with the acquired aga stores  and purchase accounting adjustments of million relating to a closure plan of certain acquired aga stores 
on a store count basis  activity and the remaining number of stores to be closed are summarized as follows number of stores to be closed beginning stores plan stores balance to store count by fiscal year balance added amendments closed be closed at february   there were stores remaining to be closed under our store closing plans  comprised of the following stores in plan stores balance to store count by fiscal year of accrual closing plan amendments closed be closed we expect cash outflows for closed store locations of approximately million during fiscal and the remainder of cash outflows to occur during fiscal and we plan to fund these outflows from normal operating cash flows and borrowings under our senior credit facility 
we anticipate that we will close or relocate approximately stores during fiscal we anticipate that the majority of these closures will occur at the end of the lease term  resulting in minimal store closing costs 
outlook in fiscal  we expect to grow comparable stores sales by to 
we anticipate gross profit in fiscal to approximate the levels of fiscal and expect to pay down our long term debt by an additional million to million 
although this should result in reduced interest expense  any significant increase in the libor rate to which our variable rate debt is indexed  could mitigate this planned improvement 
any unusual weather conditions  competitive pressures  or other adverse changes to our business or the economy in general could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents factors affecting liquidity and capital resources sales trends our business is somewhat seasonal in nature  with the highest sales occurring in the months of june through october overlapping our second and third fiscal quarters 
in addition  our business is affected by weather conditions 
while unusually severe or inclement weather tends to reduce sales  as our customers are more likely to defer elective maintenance during such periods  extremely hot and cold temperatures tend to enhance sales by causing auto parts to fail and sales of seasonal products to increase 
as a result of our refinancing  we were able to improve relationships with our vendors and eliminate many out of stock conditions that pressured our sales 
since the completion of the refinancing  our same store sales increases have been in the mid to high single digits 
in addition  our same store retail customer counts have become positive 
this improved sales performance reflects our improved inventory position and the generally favorable dynamics in the us automotive aftermarket sector 
inflation we do not believe our operations have been materially affected by inflation 
we believe that we will be able to mitigate the effects of future merchandise cost increases principally through economies of scale resulting from increased volumes of purchases  selective forward buying and the use of alternative suppliers 
debt covenants our credit agreement contains negative covenants and restrictions on actions by us and our subsidiaries including  without limitation  restrictions and limitations on indebtedness  liens  guarantees  mergers  asset dispositions not in the ordinary course of business  investments  loans  advances and acquisitions  payment of dividends  transactions with affiliates as defined in the credit agreement  change in business conducted  and certain prepayments other than in the ordinary course of business and amendments of subordinated indebtedness 
our credit agreement requires that we meet certain financial covenants  ratios and tests  including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
the consolidated leverage ratio is consolidated total funded debt  as defined in the credit agreement  divided by consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement 
the interest coverage ratio is consolidated ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  divided by cash interest expense  as defined in the credit agreement 
at february   our consolidated leverage ratio was to  and our interest coverage ratio was to  both of which were in compliance with the related covenants 
we anticipate meeting all required covenants under our existing credit agreement in fiscal the following table shows the ratios that we need to meet through the life of our credit agreement 
interest leverage coverage ratio must ratio must be at or be at or fiscal year fiscal quarter below above first to to second to to third to to fourth to to first to to second to to third to to fourth to to a breach of the covenants  ratios  or restrictions contained in our credit agreement could result in an event of default thereunder 
upon the occurrence of such an event of default  the lenders under our credit agreement could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement  together with accrued 
table of contents interest  to be immediately due and payable 
if we were unable to repay those amounts  the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness 
if the lenders under the credit agreement accelerate the payment of the indebtedness  we cannot be assured that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness  which is secured by substantially all of our assets 
although we have significantly reduced our outstanding debt over recent years  we are still highly leveraged 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences on our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes 
a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of interest on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes 
we are substantially more leveraged than some of our competitors  which might place us at a competitive disadvantage to those competitors that have lower debt service obligations and significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do 
we may not be able to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and we may be more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business 
credit ratings currently  our debt instruments are rated by the major debt rating agencies 
the table below outlines our debt ratings 
description of debt moody s rating standard poor s term loan ba bb revolver ba bb notes b b notes b b interest rates financial market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
interest earned on our cash equivalents as well as interest paid on our variable rate debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
our variable rate debt relates to borrowings under our senior credit facility and our million rate swap agreement  which are primarily vulnerable to movements in the libor rate 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below for a more detailed explanation about our variable interest rate risk 
critical accounting matters we define a critical accounting matter as one that is both significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgements 
inventories and cost of sales net realizable value 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined utilizing the last in  first out lifo method 
our inventory levels have been generally consistent in recent years and thus  under lifo  costs of sales reflect the costs of the most currently purchased inventories 
inventory carrying balances on the other hand  reflect the costs relating to prices paid in prior years under the lifo method 
our costs of acquiring inventories through normal purchasing activities have been decreasing in recent years as our increased size and cash flows have enabled us to take advantage of volume discounts and lower product acquisition costs 
accordingly  it costs us less money to replace inventory today than the lifo balances carried for similar inventory in our financial statements 
as a result of the lifo method of accounting for inventory and the ability to obtain lower product acquisition costs  we recorded reductions to cost of goods sold of million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 

table of contents as a result of the above  the replacement cost of inventories approximated million and million at february  and february   respectively  as compared to financial statement carrying values of million and million 
while carrying balances are higher than replacement costs  such carrying balances are not higher than the net realizable value amount nrv we expect to earn by selling the inventory through our retail stores in the normal course of business 
under generally accepted accounting principles  nrv reflects the expected selling price of the inventories  less expected disposal costs and a normal profit margin 
we evaluate the difference between carrying balances and nrv of our inventories at each balance sheet reporting date 
at february   we estimated that the nrv of our inventories exceeded carrying balances by approximately million and thus no impairment is indicated 
if our evaluation in a future period were to indicate that carrying balances exceed the nrv of the inventories  the carrying balances of the inventory would be reduced to nrv  with a corresponding charge to operations 
vendor programs 
cost of sales includes product cost  net of earned vendor rebates  discounts and allowances 
we recognize vendor rebates  discounts and allowances based on the terms of written agreements 
such amounts may be amortized over the life of the applicable agreements  or recognized as inventory is sold 
certain vendor rebates are reimbursements for costs we incur to sell the vendor s products and are recognized as a reduction of selling expenses 
other rebates  including amounts received that are in excess of our costs  are presumed to be a reduction of the prices of the vendor s products and are accounted for as a reduction of our cost of sales 
at each balance sheet reporting date  we reduce inventory carrying balances by an estimate of purchase discounts and volume rebates that remain in ending inventory at period end  based upon inventory turnover rates 
such discounts and rebates reduced inventory balances by approximately million and million as of february  and february   respectively 
inventory handling costs 
certain operating and administrative costs associated with purchasing and handling of inventory are capitalized in inventories 
the amounts of such costs included in inventories as of february  and february  were approximately million and million  respectively 
deferred tax asset included in our net deferred tax liability are deferred tax assets of approximately million as of february   reflecting the benefit of federal and state tax loss carryforwards approximating million and million  which begin to expire in and  respectively 
realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the loss carryforwards 
utilization of certain of the net operating loss carryforwards may be limited under section of the internal revenue code 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
accordingly  we believe that no valuation allowance is required for deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
legal matters we currently and from time to time are involved in other litigation incidental to the conduct of our business  including asbestos and similar product liability claims  slip and fall and other general liability claims  discrimination and employment claims  vendor disputes  and miscellaneous environmental and real estate claims 
the damages claimed in some of this litigation are substantial 
based on an internal review  we accrue reserves using our best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable contingent liabilities 
although the amount of liability that may result from these matters cannot be ascertained  we do not currently believe that any of these legal claims  individually or in the aggregate  will result in liabilities material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  if our estimates related to these contingent liabilities are incorrect  the future results of operations for any particular fiscal quarter or year could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents self insurance reserves we purchase third party insurance for workers compensation  automobile  product and general liability claims that exceed a certain dollar threshold 
however  we are responsible for the payment of claims under these insured limits 
in estimating the obligation associated with incurred losses  we utilize loss development factors prepared by independent third party actuaries 
these development factors utilize historical data to project the future development of incurred losses 
loss estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims settlements and reported claims 
during fiscal we recorded million of workers compensation expense reflecting increased loss reserves for claims incurred during plan years through and claims relating to the acquired paccar stores  in response to increasing medical and claims costs  primarily in california 
store closing costs if a store location does not meet our required standards  it is designated for closure 
we provide an allowance for estimated costs and losses to be incurred in connection with store closures 
we establish this allowance based on an assessment of market conditions for rents and include assumptions for vacancy periods and sublease rentals 
in fiscal years and  we were required to make adjustments of million and million respectively to the allowance because actual market conditions were different from the assumptions we made at the time we established the allowance 
we may be required to make further adjustments in future periods 
there are several significant assumptions that underlie the estimates inherent in the closed store reserve 
these assumptions include real estate broker estimates for vacancy periods and estimated sublease rates based on the broker s experience and expertise  fulfillment by our subtenants of their lease obligations  estimates for occupancy expenses based on historical averages and  in the case of real estate taxes  subject to changes by taxing authorities 
accordingly  we continuously review these assumptions and revise the reserve as necessary 
in addition  there are certain assumptions that are sensitive to deviations and could produce actual results significantly different from management s original assumptions 
these assumptions may be revised as follows national or regional economic conditions that can shorten or lengthen vacancy periods  deterioration of neighborhoods surrounding store locations resulting in longer than anticipated vacancy periods  changing subtenant needs resulting in functional obsolescence of store locations  and subtenant defaults or bankruptcies resulting in vacant properties 
historically  we have recorded revisions in estimates to the closed store reserve that have resulted from these issues 
these revisions usually result from overall longer vacancy periods on store locations and realized sublease rates lower than originally anticipated 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement applies to all entities that have legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development or normal use of the asset 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements   and  amendment of fasb statement  and technical corrections 
sfas no 
updates  clarifies and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements and addresses the reporting of debt extinguishments and accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
by february  during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded an extraordinary loss of million net of income tax benefit relating to the early retirement of debt 
sfas no 
will require that this amount be reclassified to operations 

table of contents in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize the present value of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by the standard include lease rental and termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  store closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
sfas no 
is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december   with early implementation encouraged 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  we did not incur any new liability related to a disposal cost or exit activity between adoption of this statement and the end of our fiscal year 
the adoption of this pronouncement will impact the timing of recognition of future closed store charges  which will be recorded at fair value when a store is vacated 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
requires expanded and more prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method on reported results 
we adopted sfas no 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which addresses the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees 
fin no 
also requires the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of certain guarantees 
the initial measurement of this liability is the fair value of the guarantee at inception 
the recognition of the liability is required even if it is not probable that payments will be required under the guarantee or if the guarantee was issued with a premium payment or as part of a transaction with multiple elements 
we have adopted the disclosure requirements of fin no 
and will apply the recognition and measurement provisions for all guarantees entered into or modified after december  in the ordinary course of our business  from time to time  we enter into agreements with unrelated parties which may contain indemnity obligations triggered by pre existing conditions eg  environmental contamination  our prior performance or third party acts 
these indemnification provisions are the result of negotiated transactions and  in each such case  we have determined that the indemnity obligation is acceptable based on one or more factors  including the existence of an indemnification in our favor by an unrelated third party  availability of insurance coverage  the remote possibility that the triggering event would occur  and or the determination that the cost of performing the indemnity obligation would not be significant 
we are not aware of the occurrence of any triggering event or condition that would have a material adverse impact on our financial statements as a result of an indemnity obligation relating to any such triggering event or condition 
accordingly  the adoption of fin no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb 
the primary objectives of fin no 
are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the variable interest entity the primary beneficiary 
the transitional disclosure requirements of fin no 
take effect immediately and are required in all financial statements initially issued after january   if certain conditions are met 
we do not have any transactions or relationships with variable interest entities and  therefore  fin no 
will not impact our financial statements 
in march  the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb reached consensus on certain matters discussed in eitf  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain considerations received from a vendor 
under the eitf  rebates or allowances provided by our vendors are presumed to be a reduction in the costs of purchasing inventories to be recognized in costs of sales  except for that portion that is a reimbursement for costs incurred by us to sell the vendors products 
in order to qualify as a 
table of contents reimbursement  the costs must be specific  identifiable and incremental  and would be recognized as a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we have historically recognized almost all of our vendor rebates as a reduction in cost of sales  and therefore do not expect the adoption of the eitf to have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
we have also recognized certain vendor rebates  averaging approximately million annually  as reimbursement of costs to sell vendors products 
these amounts have been recorded as a reduction in advertising costs  which is a component of operating and administrative costs in our consolidated statement of operations 
in fiscal  we will evaluate any new or modified vendor contracts to determine if such reimbursements continue to qualify for recognition consistent with prior years 
to the extent such costs do not qualify as reimbursements  they will be reclassified and treated as a reduction in the costs of acquiring the related inventories 
since we expect to maintain relatively consistent levels of inventories  this reclassification of costs is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
however  it could result in a higher gross margin offset by higher advertising expenses to the extent that such costs are reclassified 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
we hold no securities for purposes of trading 
interest earned on our cash equivalents as well as interest paid on our variable rate debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
in february  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement which converted the interest payment obligation on million of our senior notes to a floating rate  set quarterly  equal to the month libor rate plus basis points 
our variable rate debt relates to borrowings under our senior credit facility and our rate swap agreement  which are primarily vulnerable to movements in the libor rate 
our variable and fixed rate debt at february  consisted of the following in thousands average interest fixed or debt facility balance rate variable senior credit facility term  variable senior credit facility revolver  variable senior notes  var fix unamortized original issue discount on senior notes fair market value of rate swap on million of senior notes sfas no 
hedge accounting adjustment senior subordinated notes  fixed capital leases  fixed total debt the coupon rate of these notes is  however the effective interest rate is due to amortization of the original issue discount net of the positive effect of the rate swap agreement on interest expense 
at february   including the million of senior notes that are part of the interest rate swap agreement  of our outstanding debt was at variable interest rates and of our outstanding debt was at fixed interest rates 
with million in variable rate debt outstanding  a change in the libor rate to which this variable rate debt is indexed would result in a million change in our annual interest expense 
this estimate assumes that our debt balance remains constant for an annual period and the interest rate change occurs at the beginning of the period
