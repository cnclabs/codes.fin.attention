this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation section should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and results appearing elsewhere in this report 
throughout the management s discussion section  we make forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of you can often identify these and other forward looking statements by terms such as becoming  may  will  should  predicts  potential  continue  anticipates  believes  estimates  seeks  expects  plans  intends  or using negative of such words  or comparable terminology 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are reasonable  and we have based these expectations on our beliefs and assumptions  such expectations may prove to be incorrect 
our actual results of operations and financial performance could differ significantly from those expressed in or implied by our forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to increasing competition in the electronic design automation market  the impact of the economic recession  the impact of sars on business activities in asia  effects that terrorist activities or events in the middle east may have on magma  its customers and industry  any delay of customer orders or failure of customers to renew licenses  weaker than anticipated sales of magma s products and services  weakness in the semiconductor or electronic systems industries  the ability to successfully manage magma s expanding operations  the ability to attract and retain the key management and technical personnel needed to operate magma successfully  the ability to continue to deliver competitive products to customers to help them get their products to market  and changes in accounting rules 
overview we provide design and implementation software that enables chip designers to reduce the time it takes to design and produce complex integrated circuits used in the communications  computing  consumer electronics  networking and semiconductor industries 
our products are used in all major phases of the chip development cycle  from initial design through physical implementation 
an important technical foundation of our software products is our patented fixedtiming methodology  which allows our customers to reduce iterations that are often required in conventional integrated circuit design processes 
our single data model architecture is a key enabler for this methodology and for our ability to deliver automated signal integrity detection and correction 
it contains logical and physical information about the design and is resident in core memory during execution  which makes it possible to analyze the design and make rapid tradeoff decisions during the physical design process 
our software products enable chip designers to meet critical time to market objectives  improve chip performance and handle chip designs involving millions of components 
blast create enables logic designers to visualize  evaluate and improve code quality  design constraints  testability and analysis 
blast create  blast fusion and blast fusion apx combine into one integrated chip design flow what traditionally had been separate logic design and physical design processes 
our integrated flow significantly reduces timing closure iterations  allowing our customers to accelerate the time it takes to design and produce deep submicron integrated circuits 

table of contents blast plan enables hierarchical planning and partitioning of a design into blocks that can be designed separately and later combined into a complex chip or system on a chip 
blast noise detects and corrects signal interference  or crosstalk  in physical designs 
blast rail is a correct by construction rail design solution that is integrated with our design implementation flow 
we provide consulting  training and services to help our customers more rapidly adopt our technology 
design services include assisting our customers in the utilization of our products for complex chip design challenges 
we also provide post contract support  or maintenance  for our products 
we license our software products to semiconductor manufacturers and electronic products companies around the world 
our customers include broadcom  infineon  nec  texas instruments  toshiba and vitesse 
nec and toshiba each accounted for at least of revenue  and together accounted for approximately of revenue  in fiscal we were incorporated in delaware in our principal executive offices are located at results way  cupertino  california and our telephone number is in the second quarter of fiscal  we transferred a number of research and development personnel who previously performed a combination of research and development and customer service activities to our service organization if their activities are limited to providing customer service 
accordingly  we have recorded their expenses into cost of sales 
on may   we repurchased  shares of common stock from roy jewell  magma s president and chief operating officer  for an aggregate purchase price of  or per share  which was the closing sale price of the common stock on that date  and mr 
jewell repaid his indebtedness to us in the same amount 
on that date  we also granted mr 
jewell an option to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  vesting monthly through march  in connection with the grant of the option  we expect to recognize approximately million of deferred stock based compensation over the month vesting period of the option 
on may   we issued million principal amount of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due may  the notes resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
the notes do not bear coupon interest and are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share  for an aggregate of  shares 
the notes are subordinated to our existing and future senior indebtedness and effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries 
magma may not redeem the notes prior to their maturity date 
magma paid approximately million in fees to the initial purchasers of the notes  which will be accounted for as debt discount and approximately million for debt issuance costs 
the shares issuable on the conversion of notes will be included in fully diluted shares outstanding under the as if converted method of accounting for purposes of our diluted earnings per share calculation 
in connection with the issuance and sale of the notes  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at a price of per share for a cash payment of approximately million from one of the initial purchasers of the notes and those shares were retired as of may  we also entered into an arrangement with credit suisse first boston international csfb international that is intended to limit potential dilution resulting from the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of the notes 
under this arrangement  which was consummated contemporaneously with the issuance of the notes  csfb international agreed to sell to magma  for per share  up to  shares of our common stock to cover our obligation to issue shares upon conversion of the notes 
in addition  we issued csfb international a warrant to purchase up to  shares of common stock for a purchase price of per share 
purchases and sales under this arrangement may be made only upon expiration of the notes or their earlier conversion to the extent therof 
our net cost incurred in connection with this arrangement was approximately million 

table of contents on june   we entered into an agreement to acquire aplus technologies inc for a combination of cash and shares of common stock  including up to approximately million in cash and up to  shares of our common stock  for an aggregate value of approximately million 
approximately of the aggregate purchase consideration will be payable at closing of the acquisition  which is expected to occur in the quarter ending september  the remaining of the purchase consideration is payable pursuant to an earnout arrangement  under which will be payable based upon aplus technologies bookings in fiscal  will be payable upon completion of certain technology milestones  and will be payable based on operating income targets no later than march  upon completion of the milestones  we will recognize additional purchase price equal to the fair value of the cash paid and stock issued to aplus shareholders on the date the milestones are achieved 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparing these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  and investments 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  as modified by sop  which generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements such as software products  upgrades  enhancements  maintenance  installation and training to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
the fair value of an element must be based on evidence that is specific to the vendor 
if evidence of fair value does not exist for all elements of a license agreement and maintenance is the only undelivered element  then all revenue for the license arrangement is recognized over the term of the agreement 
if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred until the delivery of the element and the remaining portion of the license fee is recognized as revenue 
license revenue we derive license revenue primarily from our design and implementation software and  to a much lesser extent  from our analysis and verification products 
we license our products under time based and perpetual licenses 
we recognize license revenue after the execution of a license agreement and the delivery of the product to the customer  provided that there are no uncertainties surrounding the product acceptance  fees are fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and there are no remaining obligations other than maintenance 
for licenses where we have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  or vsoe  for maintenance  we recognize license revenue using the residual method 
for these licenses  license revenue is recognized in the period in which the license agreement is executed assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
for licenses where we have no vsoe for maintenance  we recognize license revenue ratably over the maintenance period  or if extended payment terms exist  based on the lower of amounts due and payable or ratably over the contract period 

table of contents for transactions in which we bundle maintenance for the entire license term into a time based license agreement  no vsoe of fair value exists for each element of the arrangement 
for these agreements  where the only undelivered element is maintenance  we recognize revenue ratably over the contract term 
if an arrangement involves extended payment terms that is  where less than is due in one year from the contract date we recognize revenue to the extent of the lesser of the portion of the amount presently due and payable or the ratable portion of the entire fee 
for our perpetual licenses and some time based license arrangements  we unbundle maintenance  by including maintenance for only the first year of the license term  with maintenance renewable by the customer at the rate stated in their agreements with us 
in these unbundled licenses  the aggregate renewal period is greater than or equal to the initial maintenance period 
the stated rate for maintenance renewal in these contracts is vsoe of the fair value of maintenance in both our unbundled time based and perpetual licenses 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we changed our business practice for pricing of maintenance renewals from a fixed percentage of annual list price to a fixed percentage of the annual net license fee 
we believe these new pricing policies better reflect the underlying economics of our software license agreements as we enter into larger scale license arrangements with our customers  which include substantial discounts from our list prices 
where the only undelivered element is maintenance  we recognize license revenue using the residual method 
if an arrangement involves extended payment terms  revenue recognized using the residual method is limited to amounts due and payable 
services revenue we derive services revenue primarily from consulting and training for our software products and from maintenance fees for our products 
most of our license agreements include maintenance  generally for a one year period  renewable annually 
services revenue from maintenance arrangements is recognized on a straight line basis over the maintenance term 
because we have vsoe of fair value for consulting and training services  revenue is recognized as these services are delivered or completed 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate using the factors described above 
we also monitor our accounts receivable for concentration to any one customer  industry or geographic region 
to date our receivables have not had any particular concentrations that  if not collected  would have a significant impact on our operating income loss 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future 
investments we invest in debt and equity of privately held technology companies for business and strategic purposes 
these companies are typically in the early stage of development and are expected to incur substantial losses in the near term 
therefore  these companies may never become publicly traded 
even if they do  an active trading market for their securities may never develop and we may never realize any return on these investments 
further  if these companies are not successful  we could incur charges related to write downs or write offs of these investments 

table of contents we review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts based on information requested from these privately held companies on at least a quarterly basis 
assessing each investment s carrying value requires significant judgment by management 
if we determine that an other than temporary decline in fair value exists in a strategic investment  we write down the investment to its fair value and record the related expense in other income expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
during fiscal year  we determined that the decline in value of certain strategic investments was other than temporary and recorded write downs of these investments totaling  during fiscal and we recorded no investment write downs 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
however  adjustments could be required in the future if we determine that the amount to be realized is greater or less than the amount we have recorded 
valuation of long lived intangible assets as we acquire intangible assets through acquisitions  we will review long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived asset whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or asset  a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired business  difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired business or use of an asset 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth income statement data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated years ended march  revenue licenses services total revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring costs amortization of stock based compensation total operating expenses operating profit loss other income expense interest income other expense interest expense subordinated convertible promissory notes other income expense  net net income loss before income taxes income taxes net income loss less preferred stock dividend net income loss attributed to common stockholders fiscal years ended march  and revenue revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to the increases in both license and service revenue 
of the million of revenue recognized during fiscal  approximately million is license revenue 
the increase in revenue is due to sales to new customers  which increased by more than from the prior year  proliferation to additional design group designers in existing customers and the additions of new products 
our revenue consists of perpetual  bundled and unbundled time based license agreements 
revenue for bundled time based licenses is generally recognized over the contract period while revenue from unbundled time based and perpetual licenses are generally recognized at the beginning of the contract period 
pcs for unbundled time based and perpetual licenses is recognized over the contract period 
certain significant contracts with extended payment terms entered into in recent quarters provide for payments  which are weighted towards the latter part of the contract term 
accordingly  if the payment terms are extended  the revenue from these contracts is recognized as amounts become due and payable 
revenue recognized under these arrangements will be higher in the latter part of the contract term 
our ability to recognize revenue in the future on contracts with extended payment terms will be subject to the customer s continuing credit worthiness 
although we plan to enter into both bundled and unbundled time based license agreements and perpetual license 
table of contents agreements in the future  we expect to derive the majority of our revenue in the foreseeable future from unbundled time based license agreements 
license revenue license revenue increased  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal for fiscal  the increase was primarily due to increased license revenue from our design and implementation software products  specifically from the introduction of blast fusion apx as well as from existing products  such as blast fusion  blast noise and to a lesser extent from blast chip 
for the quarter ended september   we began to recognize revenue from perpetual and unbundled time based license agreements using the residual method under sop which revenue recognition is accelerated 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we changed our revenue model for maintenance from a fixed percentage of list price to a percentage of the net license fee 
we believe this methodology for recording maintenance is substantive and better reflects the underlying economics as the company enters into larger scale license arrangements with our customers 
we expect license revenue to continue to grow in absolute dollars during fiscal services revenue services revenue increased  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to consulting services provided to licensees of our design and implementation software products 
although we intend to continue to offer these consulting services  we expect consulting service revenue as a percent of total revenue to remain flat 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of cost of license revenue and  to a lesser extent  cost of consulting services for our design and implementation software products and amortization of technology acquired 
cost of revenue consists primarily of salary and related costs for engineers associated with technical services  including quality assurance  and cost of engineers associated with post contract customer support  consulting services  and amortization of acquired technology 
to date  the cost of service revenue for analysis and verification products has been insignificant 
cost of revenue increased in absolute dollars from million or of revenue in fiscal to million or of revenue in fiscal the increase is primarily due to costs associated with additional support required by our expanding customer base combined with costs related to increased design services 
the cost of sales relating to design services increased as a result of increased services revenue 
in addition  we transferred the costs associated with all research and development employees who work in design services to cost of sales at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal because such employees activities were revised and now only perform work on customer related activities 
we expect cost of sales to decline as a percentage of revenue due to the emphasis on higher margin software products 
operating expenses research and development during the second quarter of fiscal  we transferred the costs associated with all research and development employees who work in design services to cost of sales because such employees will only perform work on customer related activities 
research and development expense consists primarily of salaries  bonuses and benefits of engineering personnel  depreciation of engineering equipment  and outside engineering services from contractors and consultants as we continue to invest in our technology 
research and development expense increased in absolute dollars from million or of revenue in fiscal to million or of revenue in fiscal the fiscal increase of million was attributed to an increase in travel expense of million  payroll related expenses of million due to an increase in headcount  and outside services of consultants of million 
these increases were offset by million of costs transferred to cost of sales 
these costs were associated with a number of research and development personnel who previously performed a 
table of contents combination of research and development and services activities for our services organization 
their activities were changed limiting them to providing services only 
development costs incurred in the research and development of new technology and enhancements to existing technology are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility in the form of a working model has been established 
to date  we have not capitalized any costs for our software development as technological feasibility is established concurrently with the general release of the product 
although we expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars and that these expenses will fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue  our objective is to reduce research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue over time 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries  sales commissions  bonuses  benefits and related costs of sales and marketing personnel  tradeshows and other marketing activities 
sales and marketing expense increased from million or of revenue in fiscal to million or of revenue in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increases in payroll related expenses of million resulting from headcount increases to support the sales plan  advertising expense of million  third party sales representative commissions of million resulting from growth outside the united states  principally in asia  travel expense of million and office related expense of million 
in addition  an increase of million related to the change in business focus of the field application engineers toward sales support  from customer design services charged to cost of sales in the prior year 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction of million in commission expense resulting from a change in the compensation plan  million in industry tradeshow related expenses 
for fiscal year  the company is changing its sales compensation plan such the commissions earned on fiscal year orders will be equivalent to payments made 
payments will be spread on a ratable basis over two to six quarters depending on the dollar amount of an individual order 
we expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars in connection with the anticipated expansion of our customer base and the number and amount of our license agreements 

although we expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars and that these expenses will fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue  our objective is to reduce sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue over time 
general and administrative general and administrative expense consists of salaries  bonuses  benefits and related costs of finance and administrative personnel and outside service expenses including legal  accounting and recruiting services 
general and administrative expense increased from million or of revenue in fiscal to million or of revenue in fiscal of the net increase of million  million was related to the settlement with prolific  inc other increases include outside services of million primarily from legal and accounting services  insurance expense of million  bad debt expense of million  travel expenses of  office related expenses of million and payroll related expenses of million 
although we expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars and that these expenses will fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue  our objective is to reduce general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue over time 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense consists of the amortization of deferred stock based compensation resulting from the grant of stock options at exercise prices less than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the grant date for officers and employees and the fair value of the stock options granted to consultants and other non employees 
the options granted to officers and employees generally vest over four years  with vesting after one year and the balance vesting ratably over the remaining months 
stock based compensation declined  to million or of revenue in fiscal from million or of revenue in fiscal for the year ended march   stock based compensation included million related to employees  of which million was associated with our asset purchase of veratest  which occurred in fiscal and million expense related to consultant options 

table of contents other income expense  net other income expense  net was million in fiscal and million in fiscal interest income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to a change in the investment policy to include long term investments beginning in the fourth quarter and more funds being available for investment on average for the year ended march  interest and other expense decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a non cash charge of million related to the million subordinated convertible promissory notes issued in july and august such charges will not be incurred in future periods since the promissory notes were automatically converted into common stock on the completion of our initial public offering in november for the year ended march   we had an other than temporary decline in fair value of million related to two of our strategic investments 
income taxes prior to fiscal year  we have incurred net losses since inception for federal and state tax purposes and have not recognized any tax benefit 
we are in a net deferred tax asset position  which has been fully reserved 
we will continue to provide a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets until it becomes more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized 
the increase of income taxes of million between the years ended march  and is primarily due to foreign tax expenses and us federal alternative minimum tax 
as of march   we had approximately million of federal and million of state net operating loss carry forwards to offset future taxable income 
the federal net operating loss carry forwards expire on various dates from through the state net operating loss carry forwards expire on various dates from through utilization of net operating losses and credits is subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
fiscal years ended march  and revenue revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal of the million of revenue recognized during fiscal  approximately million is license revenue 
while to date we have focused primarily on time based license agreements on which revenue has been recognized ratably  we also began to enter into perpetual licenses and unbundled time based license agreements during the quarter ended september  for the year ended march   revenue from our ratable time based licenses accounted for approximately of our total revenue  and revenue from our perpetual and our unbundled time based license agreements accounted for approximately of our total revenue 
license revenue license revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in license revenue from our design and implementation software products  specifically from blast fusion and to a lesser extent from blast chip  which was first shipped in may in addition  beginning in the quarter ended september   we began to recognize revenue under perpetual and unbundled time based license agreements using the residual method under which revenue is recognized more rapidly 
for the year ended march   million and million  respectively  were derived from perpetual licenses and unbundled time based license agreements using the residual method

the risks described below may not be the only risks we face 
additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could suffer  and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 
we were incorporated in april and introduced our first principal software product  blast fusion  in april our business model is still emerging  and the revenue and income potential of our business and market is unproven 
we have a limited history of generating revenue from our software products 
as a result of our short operating history  we have limited financial data that can be used to evaluate our business 
our software products represent a new approach to the challenges presented in the electronic design automation market  which to date has been dominated by established companies with longer operating histories 
key markets within the electronic design automation industry may fail to adopt our proprietary technologies and software products 
any evaluation of our business and our prospects must be considered in light of our limited operating history and the risks and uncertainties often encountered by relatively young companies 
we have a history of losses prior to fiscal and had an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of march   if we do not increase profitability  our public stock trading price would be likely to decline 
we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of march  although we achieved profitability in fiscal  we incurred losses in prior years 
if we incur new losses  or do not increase profitability at a level expected by securities analysts or investors  the market price of our common stock is likely to decline 
if we incur net losses  we may not be able to maintain or increase our number of employees or our investment in capital equipment  sales  marketing  and research and development programs  and we may not be able to continue to operate 

table of contents our quarterly results are difficult to predict  and if we miss quarterly financial expectations  our stock price could decline 
our quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict  and fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
it is likely that our operating results in some periods will be below investor expectations 
if this happens  the market price of our common stock is likely to decline 
fluctuations in our future quarterly operating results may be caused by many factors  including size and timing of customer orders  which are received unevenly and unpredictably throughout a fiscal year  the mix of products licensed and types of license agreements  our ability to recognize revenue in a given quarter  timing of customer license payments  time based license agreements with graduated payment schedules that reflect phased deployment of our software and lower relative payments in the first years  the relative mix of time based licenses bundled with maintenance  unbundled time based license agreements and perpetual license agreements  each of which has different revenue recognition practices  the relative mix of our license and services revenues  our ability to win new customers and retain existing customers  changes in our pricing and discounting practices and licensing terms and those of our competitors  changes in the level of our operating expenses  including increases in incentive compensation payments that may be associated with future revenue growth  changes in the interpretation of the authoritative literature under which we recognize revenue  the timing of product releases or upgrades by us or our competitors  and the integration  by us or our competitors  of newly developed or acquired products 
customer payment defaults may cause us to be unable to recognize revenue from backlog and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
as of march   we had approximately million in backlog  which we define as non cancelable contractual commitments by our customers  through purchase orders or contracts that have no contingencies other than our performance 
we expect that we will ultimately be able to recognize this backlog as revenue 
however  if a customer defaults and fails to pay amounts owed  we may not be able to recognize expected revenue from backlog 
in the current economic environment it is possible that customers from whom we expect to derive revenue from backlog will default or that the level of defaults will increase 
any material payment default by our customers could reduce the amount of backlog we recognize as revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle  and the large size of some orders  makes it difficult for us to forecast revenue and increases the magnitude of quarterly fluctuations  which could harm our stock price 
customers for our software products typically commit significant resources to evaluate available software 
the complexity of our products requires us to spend substantial time and effort to assist potential customers in evaluating our software and in benchmarking it against our competition 
in addition  potential customers may be limited in their current spending by existing time based licenses with their legacy vendors 
in these cases  customers delay a significant new commitment to our software until the term of the existing license has expired 
also  because our products require a significant investment of time and cost by our customers  we must target 
table of contents those individuals within the customer s organization who are able to make these decisions on behalf of their companies 
these individuals tend to be senior management in an organization  typically at the vice president level 
we may face difficulty identifying and establishing contact with such individuals 
even after initial acceptance  the negotiation and documentation processes can be lengthy 
our sales cycle typically ranges between three and nine months  but can be longer 
any delay in completing sales in a particular quarter could cause our operating results to fall below expectations 
we rely on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue  and our revenue could decline due to delays of customer orders or the failure of existing customers to renew licenses or if we are unable to maintain or develop relationships with current or potential customers 
our business depends on sales to a small number of customers 
in fiscal  we had two customers that each accounted for more than of our revenue and that together accounted for approximately of our revenue 
in fiscal  we had two customers that each accounted for more than of our revenue and that together accounted for approximately of our revenue 
we expect that we will continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
if we fail to successfully sell our products and services to one or more customers in any particular period  or a large customer purchases less of our products or services  defers orders  or fails to renew licenses  our business and operating results would be harmed 
most of our customers license our software under a time based licensing agreement  with terms that typically vary from months to months 
most of our licensing agreements automatically expire at the end of the term unless the customer renews the license with us or purchases a perpetual license 
if our customers do not renew their licenses  we may not be able to maintain our current revenue or may not generate additional revenue 
some of our licensing agreements allow customers to terminate an agreement prior to its expiration under limited circumstances for example  if our products do not meet specified performance requirements or goals 
if these agreements are terminated prior to expiration or we are unable to collect under these agreements  our revenue may decline 
some contracts with extended payment terms provide for payments which are weighted toward the later part of the contract term 
accordingly  as the payment terms are extended  the revenue from these contracts is not recognized evenly over the contract term  but is recognized as the lesser of the cumulative amounts due and payable or ratably for bundled agreements  and as amounts become due and payable for unbundled agreements  at each period end 
revenue recognized under these arrangements will be higher in the later part of the contract term  which puts our revenue recognition in the future at greater risk of the customer s continuing credit worthiness 
in addition  some of our customers have extended payment terms  which creates additional credit risk 
we compete against companies that hold a large share of the electronic design automation market 
if we cannot compete successfully  we will not gain market share 
we currently compete with companies that hold dominant shares in the electronic design automation market  such as cadence and synopsys 
each of these companies has a longer operating history and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do  as well as greater name recognition and larger installed customer bases 
our competitors are better able to offer aggressive discounts on their products  a practice they often employ 
our competitors offer a more comprehensive range of products than we do  for example  we do not offer logic simulation  formal verification  full feature custom layout editing  analog or mixed signal products  which can sometimes be an impediment to our winning a particular customer order 
in addition  our industry has traditionally viewed acquisitions as an effective strategy for growth in products and market share and our competitors greater cash resources and higher market capitalization may give them a relative advantage over us in buying companies with promising new chip design products or companies that may be too large for us to acquire without a strain on our resources 
examples of acquisitions by our competitors 
table of contents include synopsys acquisition of avant and cadence s acquisition of getchip 
further consolidation in the electronic design automation market could result in an increasingly competitive environment 
competitive pressures may prevent us from gaining market share  require us to reduce the price of products and services or cause us to lose existing customers  which could harm our business 
to execute our business strategy successfully  we must continue to increase our sales worldwide 
if we fail to do so in a timely manner or at all  we may not be able to gain market share and our business and operating results could suffer 
also  a variety of small companies continue to emerge  developing and introducing new products 
any of these companies could become a significant competitor in the future 
we also compete with the internal chip design automation development groups of our existing and potential customers 
therefore  these customers may not require  or may be reluctant to purchase  products offered by independent vendors 
our competitors may develop or acquire new products or technologies that have the potential to replace our existing or new product offerings 
the introduction of these new or additional products by competitors may cause potential customers to defer purchases of our products 
if we fail to compete successfully  we will not gain market share and our business will fail 
we may not be able to hire the number of qualified engineering personnel required for our business  particularly field application engineering personnel  which would harm our ability to grow 
we continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining skilled engineers with appropriate qualifications to support our growth strategy 
our success depends on our ability to identify  hire  train and retain qualified engineering personnel with experience in integrated circuit design 
specifically  we need to attract and retain field application engineers to work with our direct sales force to technically qualify new sales opportunities and perform design work to demonstrate our products capabilities to customers during the benchmark evaluation process 
competition for qualified engineers is intense  particularly in silicon valley where our headquarters are located 
if we lose the services of a significant number of our engineers or we cannot hire additional engineers  we will be unable to increase our sales or implement or maintain our growth strategy 
because many of our current competitors have pre existing relationships with our current and potential customers  we might not be able to gain market share  which could harm our operations 
many of our competitors  including cadence and synopsys  have established relationships with our current and potential customers and can devote substantial resources aimed at preventing us from establishing or enhancing our customer relationships 
these existing relationships can make it difficult for us to obtain additional customers due to the substantial investment that these potential customers have already made in their current design flows 
if we are unable to gain market share due to these relationships with our potential customers  our operating results could be harmed 
our operating results will be significantly harmed if chip designers do not adopt blast fusion and blast fusion apx 
blast fusion and blast fusion apx have accounted for a significant majority of our revenue since our inception and we believe that revenue from blast fusion and blast fusion apx and related products will account for most of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
if integrated circuit designers do not adopt blast fusion and blast fusion apx  our operating results will be significantly harmed 
we must continue market penetration of blast fusion and blast fusion apx to achieve our growth strategy and financial success 
if the industries into which we sell our products experience recession or other cyclical effects affecting our customers research and development budgets  our revenue would be likely to decline 
demand for our products is driven by new integrated circuit design projects 
the demand from semiconductor and systems companies is uncertain and difficult to predict 
slower growth in the semiconductor 
table of contents and systems industries  a reduced number of design starts  reduction of electronic design automation budgets or continued consolidation among our customers would harm our business and financial condition 
we have experienced slower growth in revenue than we anticipated as a result of the prolonged downturn and decreased spending by our customers in the semiconductor and systems industries 
the primary customers for our products are companies in the communications  computing  consumer electronics  networking and semiconductor industries 
any significant downturn in our customers markets or in general economic conditions that results in the cutback of research and development budgets or the delay of software purchases would be likely to result in lower demand for our products and services and could harm our business 
for example  the united states economy  including the semiconductor industry  is currently experiencing a slowdown  which has negatively impacted and may continue to impact our business and operating results 
terrorist attacks in the united states  the aftermath of war with iraq and other worldwide events including in the middle east have increased uncertainty in the united states economy 
if the economy continues to decline as a result of the economic  political and social turmoil  existing customers may delay their implementation of our software products and prospective customers may decide not to adopt our software products  either of which could negatively impact our business and operating results 
in addition  the markets for semiconductor products are cyclical 
in recent years  some asian countries have experienced significant economic difficulties  including devaluation and instability  business failures and a depressed business environment 
these difficulties triggered a significant downturn in the semiconductor market  resulting in reduced budgets for chip design tools  which  in turn  negatively impacted us 
we have experienced delayed orders and slower deployment of our products under new orders as a result of reduced budgets for chip design tools 
in addition  the electronics industry has historically been subject to seasonal and cyclical fluctuations in demand for its products  and this trend may continue in the future 
these industry downturns have been  and may continue to be  characterized by diminished product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and subsequent erosion of average selling prices 
difficulties in developing and achieving market acceptance of new products and delays in planned release dates of our software products and upgrades may harm our business 
to succeed  we will need to develop innovative new products 
we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund all required future innovations 
also  any revenue that we receive from enhancements or new generations of our proprietary software products may be less than the costs of development 
if we cannot successfully develop and market new products  or if we fail to do so in a timely manner  our reputation and our business would suffer 
our costs of customer engagement and support are high  so our gross margin may decrease if we incur higher than expected costs associated with providing support services in the future or if we reduce our prices 
because of the complexity of our products  we typically incur high field application engineering support costs to engage new customers and assist them in their evaluations of our products 
if we fail to manage our customer engagement and support costs  our operating results could suffer 
in addition  our gross margin may decrease if we are unable to manage support costs associated with the mix of license and services revenue we generate or if we reduce prices in response to competitive pressure 
product defects could cause us to lose customers and revenue  or to incur unexpected expenses 
our products depend on complex software  both internally developed and licensed from third parties 
our customers may use our products with other companies products  which also contain complex software 
if our software does not meet our customers performance requirements  our customer relationships may suffer 
also  a limited number of our contracts include specified ongoing performance criteria 
if our products fail to meet these 
table of contents criteria  it may lead to termination of these agreements and loss of future revenue 
complex software often contains errors 
any failure or poor performance of our software or the third party software with which it is integrated could result in delayed market acceptance of our software products  delays in product shipments  unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to identify the source of errors or to correct errors  damage to our reputation  delayed or lost revenue  and product liability claims 
our product functions are often critical to our customers  especially because of the resources our customers expend on the design and fabrication of integrated circuits 
many of our licensing agreements contain provisions to provide a limited warranty  which provides the customer with a right of refund for the license fees if we are unable to correct errors reported during the warranty period 
if our contractual limitations are unenforceable in a particular jurisdiction or if we are exposed to product liability claims that are not covered by insurance  a successful claim could harm our business 
we currently do not carry product liability insurance 
much of our business is international  which exposes us to risks inherent to doing business internationally that could harm our business 
we also intend to expand our international operations 
if our revenue from this expansion does not exceed the expenses associated with this expansion  our business and operating results could suffer 
we generated of our total revenue from sales outside north america for fiscal  compared to in fiscal while all of our international sales to date have been denominated in us dollars  our international operating expenses have been denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies could increase the relative costs of our overseas operations  which could reduce our operating margins 
the expansion of our international operations includes the maintenance of sales offices in europe  the middle east  and the asia pacific region 
if our revenue from international operations does not exceed the expense of establishing and maintaining our international operations  our business could suffer 
additional risks we face in conducting business internationally include difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations across different geographic areas  changes in currency exchange rates and controls  uncertainty regarding tax and regulatory requirements in multiple jurisdictions  the possible lack of financial and political stability in foreign countries  preventing overseas sales growth  the aftermath of war in iraq  the effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  on business in the asia pacific region  and the effects of terrorist attacks in the united states and any related conflicts or similar events worldwide 
future changes in accounting standards  specifically changes affecting revenue recognition  could cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations 
future changes in accounting standards for interpretations thereof  specifically those changes affecting software revenue recognition  could require us to change our methods of revenue recognition 
these changes 
table of contents could result in deferral of revenue recognized in current periods to subsequent periods or in accelerated recognition of deferred revenue to current periods  each of which could cause shortfalls in meeting the expectations of investors and securities analysts 
our stock price could decline as a result of any shortfall 
future implementation of internal controls reporting and attestation requirements will impose additional financial and administrative obligations on us that could adversely affect our results 
changes in effective tax rates could affect our results of operations 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the following earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we are taxed at lower statutory rates as compared to the us tax rate  an increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes  including write offs of acquired in process technology  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  or changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws 
our success will depend on our ability to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technology standards of the semiconductor industry 
if we are unable to keep pace with rapidly changing technology standards  our products could be rendered obsolete  which would cause our operating results to decline 
the semiconductor industry has made significant technological advances 
in particular  recent advances in deep sub micron technology have required electronic design automation companies to continuously develop or acquire new products and enhance existing products 
the evolving nature of our industry could render our existing products and services obsolete 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to enhance our existing products and services  develop and introduce new products and services on a timely and cost effective basis that will keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards  address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers  and acquire other companies that have complementary or innovative products 
if we are unable  for technical  legal  financial or other reasons  to respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or customer requirements  our business and operating results could be seriously harmed 
because competition for qualified personnel is intense in our industry  we may not be able to recruit necessary personnel  which could impact the development or sales of our products 
our success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain senior management  sales  marketing and other key personnel 
because of the intense competition for such personnel  it is possible that we will fail to retain key technical and managerial personnel 
if we are unable to retain our existing personnel  or attract and train additional qualified personnel  our growth may be limited due to our lack of capacity to develop and market our products 
this could harm the market s perception of our business and our ability to achieve our business goals 
our success is highly dependent on the technical  sales  marketing and managerial contributions of key individuals  and we may be unable to recruit and retain these personnel 
we depend on our senior executives  and our research and development  sales and marketing personnel  who are critical to our business 
we do not have long term employment agreements with our key employees  and we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 
if we lose the services of any of these key executives  our product development processes and sales efforts could be slowed 
we may also incur increased operating 
table of contents expenses and be required to divert the attention of other senior executives to search for their replacements 
the integration of our new executives or any new personnel could disrupt our ongoing operations 
if we fail to maintain competitive stock option packages for our employees  or if our stock price declines materially for a protracted period of time  we might have difficulty retaining our employees and our business may be harmed 
in today s competitive technology industry  employment decisions of highly skilled personnel are influenced by stock option packages  which offer incentives above traditional compensation only where there is a consistent  long term upward trend over time of a company s stock price 
if our stock price declines due to market conditions  investors perceptions of the technology industry or managerial or performance problems we have  our stock option incentives may lose value to key employees  and we may lose these employees or be forced to grant additional options to retain them 
this in turn could result in immediate and substantial dilution to investors resulting from the grant of additional options necessary to retain employees  and potential compensation charges against the company  which could negatively impact our operating results 
in addition  if we are required to account for stock options as an operating expense  our net income would be reduced or net losses increased 
accordingly  our financial results would be adversely affected  particularly relative to companies that grant fewer stock options 
if we reduce our level of stock option grants  our ability to recruit and retain employees may be adversely affected 
if our sales force compensation arrangements are designed poorly  we may lose sales personnel and resources 
designing an effective incentive compensation structure for our sales force is critical to our success 
we have experimented  and continue to experiment  with different systems of sales force compensation 
if our incentives are not well designed  we may experience reduced revenue generation  and we may also lose the services of our more productive sales personnel  either of which would reduce our revenues or potential revenues 
fluctuations in our growth place a strain on our management systems and resources  and if we fail to manage the pace of our growth our business could be harmed 
periods of growth followed by efforts to realign costs when revenue growth is slower than anticipated have placed a strain on our management  administrative and financial resources 
for example  in the third quarter of fiscal year  we laid off employees 
over time we have significantly expanded our operations in the united states and internationally  and we plan to continue to expand the geographic scope of our operations 
to pace the growth of our operations with the growth in our revenue  we must continue to improve administrative  financial and operations systems  procedures and controls 
failure to improve our internal procedures and controls could result in a disruption of our operations and harm to our business 
if we are unable to manage our growth the execution of our business plan could be delayed 
we may have difficulty assimilating technology  personnel and operations from acquisitions  and these difficulties may disrupt our business and divert management s attention 
we have made acquisitions and we may continue to pursue acquisitions that we believe may complement our business 
if we do acquire additional companies  the integration of the separate operations of our company and an acquisition partner may result in problems related to integration of technology and management teams  either of which could divert management s attention from day to day operations 
we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of acquisitions  and we may not be able to retain key management  technical and sales personnel after an acquisition 
our products incorporate software licensed from third parties  and if we lose or are unable to maintain any of these software licenses  our product shipments could be delayed or reduced 

table of contents we use software  such as front end language processing  license keying software and schematic viewing software that we license from third parties 
we have also licensed the rights to some technologies from various universities  including the technical university of eindhoven  delft university and the university of california  berkeley 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
if we cannot maintain existing third party technology licenses or enter into licenses for other existing or future technologies needed for our products  we could be required to cease or delay product shipments while we seek to develop alternative technologies 
if chip designers and manufacturers do not integrate our software into existing design flows  or if other software companies do not cooperate in working with us to interface our products with their design flows  demand for our products may decrease 
to implement our business strategy successfully  we must provide products that interface with the software of other electronic design automation software companies 
our competitors may not support our or our customers efforts to integrate our products into their existing design flows 
we must develop cooperative relationships with competitors so that they will work with us to integrate our software into a customer s design flow 
currently  our software is designed to interface with the existing software of cadence  synopsys and others 
if we are unable to convince customers to adopt our software products instead of those of competitors offering a broader set of products  or if we are unable to convince other semiconductor companies to work with us to interface our software with theirs to meet the demands of chip designers and manufacturers  our business and operating results will suffer 
we may not obtain sufficient patent protection  which could harm our competitive position and increase our expenses 
our success and ability to compete depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our software and other proprietary technology 
we currently have a few issued patents in the united states  particularly few in relation to our competitors 
these legal protections afford only limited protection for our technology 
in addition  rights that may be granted under any patent application that may issue in the future may not provide competitive advantages to us 
further  patent protection in foreign jurisdictions where we may need this protection may be limited or unavailable 
it is possible that our pending us and us patent applications may not be issued  competitors may design around our present or future issued patents or may develop competing non infringing technologies  present and future issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary rights  and present and future issued patents could be successfully challenged for validity and enforceability 
we believe the patent portfolios of our competitors are far larger than ours  and this may increase the risk that they may sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent cross licenses 
we rely on trademark  copyright and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights  and if these rights are not sufficiently protected  it could harm our ability to compete and generate income 
to establish and protect our proprietary rights  we rely on a combination of trademark  copyright and trade secret laws  and contractual restrictions  such as confidentiality agreements and licenses 
our ability to compete and grow our business could suffer if these rights are not adequately protected 
we seek to protect our source 
table of contents code for our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws 
we license our software pursuant to agreements  which impose certain restrictions on the licensee s ability to utilize the software 
we also seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements 
our proprietary rights may not be adequately protected because laws and contractual restrictions in us and foreign jurisdictions may not prevent misappropriation of our technologies or deter others from developing similar technologies  competitors may independently develop similar technologies and software code  for some of our trademarks  federal us trademark protection may be unavailable to us  our trademarks may not be protected or protectable in some foreign jurisdictions  the validity and scope of our us and foreign trademarks could be successfully challenged  and policing unauthorized use of our products and trademarks is difficult  expensive and time consuming  and we may be unable to determine the extent of this unauthorized use 
the laws of some countries in which we market our products may offer little or no protection of our proprietary technologies 
reverse engineering  unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technologies could enable third parties to benefit from our technologies without paying us for it  which would harm our competitive position and market share 
we may face intellectual property infringement or other claims against us or our customers that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights 
many of our contracts contain provisions in which we agree to indemnify our customers from third party intellectual property infringement claims 
other parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers  and our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 
we have also acquired or may hereafter acquire software as a result of our past or future acquisitions  and we may be subject to claims that such software infringes the intellectual property rights of third parties 
if we become involved in litigation  we could lose our proprietary rights and incur substantial unexpected operating costs 
intellectual property litigation is expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention from our business 
if there is a successful claim of infringement  we may be required to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or license agreements  which may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
our failure to develop non infringing technologies or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis would harm our business 
our products may infringe third party patents that may relate to our products 
also  we may be unaware of filed patent applications that relate to our software products 
we believe the patent portfolios of our competitors are far larger than ours  and this may increase the risk that they may sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent cross licenses 
we may also become involved in litigation unrelated to intellectual property infringement claims 
for example  in august  a complaint was filed against us alleging breach of contract  among other things 
this litigation was recently settled 
we may not be successful in defending other claims that may be made against us 
regardless of the outcome  litigation can result in substantial expense and could divert the efforts of our management and technical personnel 
our directors  executive officers and principal stockholders own a substantial portion of our common stock and this concentration of ownership may allow them to elect most of our directors and could delay or prevent a change in control of magma 
our directors  executive officers and stockholders who currently own over of our common stock beneficially own a substantial portion of our outstanding common stock 
these stockholders  if they vote 
table of contents together  will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval 
for example  they may be able to elect most of our directors  delay or prevent a transaction in which stockholders might receive a premium over the market price for their shares or prevent changes in control or management 
our stock price may decline significantly because of stock market fluctuations that affect the prices of technology stocks 
a decline in our stock price could result in securities class action litigation against us  that could divert management s attention and harm our business 
the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have adversely affected the market prices of common stock of technology companies 
these broad market fluctuations may reduce the market price of our common stock 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company after periods of volatility in the market price of securities 
we may in the future be a target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could harm our ability to execute our business plan 
we may need additional capital in the future  but there is no assurance that funds would be available on acceptable terms 
in the future we may need to raise additional capital in order to achieve growth or other business objectives 
this financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us and may be dilutive to existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to expand  develop or enhance services or products  or respond to competitive pressures would be limited 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware corporate law contain anti takeover provisions which could delay or prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 
we could also adopt a stockholder rights plan  which could also delay or prevent a change in control 
delaware law  as well as our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  contain anti takeover provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company  even if the change of control would be beneficial to the stockholders 
these provisions could lower the price that future investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock 
these anti takeover provisions authorize the board of directors without prior stockholder approval to to create and issue preferred stock that can issued by increasing the number of outstanding shares and deter or prevent a takeover attempt  prohibit stockholder action by written consent  thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders  establish a classified board of directors requiring that not all members of the board be elected at one time  prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates  limit the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  and require advance notice for nominations for election to the board of directors and proposals that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law and the terms of our stock option plans may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
that section generally prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for three years after the date the stockholder became an interested stockholder 
also  our stock option plans include change in 
table of contents control provisions that allow us to grant options or stock purchase rights that will become vested immediately upon a change in control of us 
the board of directors also has the power to adopt a stockholder rights plan  which could delay or prevent a change in control even if the change in control appeared to be beneficial to stockholders 
these plans  sometimes called poison pills  are sometimes criticized by institutional investors or their advisors and could affect our rating by such investors or advisors 
if the board were to adopt such a plan it might have the effect of reducing the price that new investors are willing to pay for shares of our common stock 
we are subject to risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we transact some portions of our business in various foreign currencies 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to operating expenses in the united kingdom  europe and japan  which are denominated in the respective local currencies 
as of december   we had no hedging contracts outstanding 
we do not currently use financial instruments to hedge operating expenses in the united kingdom and japan denominated in the respective local currency 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
the convertible notes we issued in may are debt obligations that must be repaid in cash in may if they are not converted into our common stock at an earlier date  which is unlikely to occur if the price of our common stock does not exceed the conversion price 
in may  we issued million principal amount of our zero coupon convertible notes due may we will be required to repay that principal amount in full in may unless the holders of those notes elect to convert them into our common stock before the repayment date 
the conversion price of the notes is per share 
if the price of our common stock does not rise above that level  conversion of the notes is unlikely and we would be required to repay the principal amount of the notes in cash 
there have been previous quarters in which we have experienced shortfalls in revenue and earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and investors  which have had an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
in addition  the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and trading volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock  regardless of our operating performance 
because the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock  volatility or depressed prices for our common stock could have a similar effect on the trading price of the notes 
hedging transactions and other transactions may affect the value of our common stock and our convertible notes 
we entered into hedging arrangements with credit suisse first boston international at the time we issued our convertible notes  with the objective of reducing the potential dilutive effect of issuing common stock upon conversion of the notes 
these hedging arrangements are likely to have caused credit suisse first boston international and others to take positions in our common stock in secondary market transactions or to enter into derivative transactions at or after the sale of the notes 
any market participants entering into hedging arrangements are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock or other securities  which may increase the volatility and reduce the market price of our common stock 
our convertible notes are subordinated and there are no financial covenants in the indenture 
our convertible notes are general unsecured obligations of magma and are subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness  which we may incur in the future 
in the event of our 
table of contents bankruptcy  liquidation or reorganization  or upon acceleration of the notes due to an event of default under the indenture and in certain other events  our assets will be available to pay obligations on the notes only after all senior indebtedness has been paid 
as a result  there may not be sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the outstanding notes 
in addition  we will not make any payments on the notes in the event of payment defaults or other specified defaults on our designated senior indebtedness 
neither we nor our subsidiaries are restricted under the indenture for the notes from incurring additional debt  including senior indebtedness 
if we or our subsidiaries incur additional debt or other liabilities  our ability to pay our obligations on the notes could be adversely affected 
we expect that we and our subsidiaries from time to time will incur additional indebtedness and other liabilities 
we may be unable to meet the requirements under the indenture to purchase our convertible notes upon a change in control 
upon a change in control  as to which is defined in the indenture to include some cash acquisitions and private company mergers  note holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes they hold 
if a change in control were to occur  we might not have enough funds to pay the purchase price for all tendered notes 
future credit agreements or other agreements relating to our indebtedness might prohibit the redemption or repurchase of the notes and provide that a change in control constitutes an event of default 
if a change in control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from purchasing the notes  we could seek the consent of our lenders to purchase the notes or could attempt to refinance this debt 
if we do not obtain a consent  we could not purchase the notes 
our failure to purchase tendered notes would constitute an event of default under the indenture  which might constitute a default under the terms of our other debt 
in such circumstances  or if a change in control would constitute an event of default under our senior indebtedness  the subordination provisions of the indenture would possibly limit or prohibit payments to note holders 
our obligation to offer to purchase the notes upon a change in control would not necessarily afford note holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction  reorganization  merger or similar transaction involving us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in widely diversified short term and long term investments  consisting primarily of investment grade securities  substantially all of which mature within the next twenty four months 
a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate  decline less than in the fair value of our available for sale securities 
foreign currency exchange risk we transact some portions of our business in various foreign currencies 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to operating expenses in the united kingdom and japan  which are denominated in the respective local currency 
as of march   we had no hedging contracts outstanding 
we do not currently use financial instruments to hedge operating expenses in the united kingdom and japan denominated in the respective local currency 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis
