results of operations demand for the company s mineral exploration drilling services depends upon the level of mineral exploration and development activities conducted by mining companies  particularly with respect to gold and copper 
mineral exploration is highly speculative and is influenced by a variety of factors  including the prevailing prices for various metals that often fluctuate widely 
in this connection  the level of mineral exploration and development activities conducted by mining companies has had  and could continue to have  a material adverse effect on the company 
overview of reportable operating segments the company is a multinational company which provides sophisticated services and related products to a variety of markets 
during fiscal  management redefined the company s operational organization structure into discrete divisions based on its primary product lines 
each division comprises a combination of individual district offices  which primarily offer similar types of services and serve similar types of markets 
although individual offices within a division may periodically perform services normally provided by another division  the results of those services are recorded in the offices own division 
for example  if a water resources division office performed geoconstruction services  the revenues would be recorded in the water resources division rather than the geoconstruction services division 
should an office s primary responsibility move from one division president to another  that office s results going forward would be reclassified between divisions at that time 
the company s reportable segments under the new operational structure are defined as follows water resources division this division provides a full line of water related services and products including hydrological studies  site selection  well design  drilling and well development  pump installation  and repair and maintenance 
the division s offerings include design and construction of water treatment facilities and the manufacture and sale of products to treat volatile inorganics in groundwater 
the division also offers environmental services to assess and monitor groundwater contaminants 
mineral exploration division this division provides a complete range of drilling services for the mineral exploration industry 
its aboveground and underground drilling activities include all phases of core drilling  diamond  reverse circulation  dual tube  hammer and rotary air blast methods 
geoconstruction services division this division focuses on services that improve soil stability  primarily jet grouting  grouting  vibratory ground improvement and ground freezing services 
the division also manufactures a line of high pressure pumping equipment used in grouting operations and geotechnical drilling rigs used for directional drilling 
energy services and production division this division offers a variety of specialized services including shallow gas and tar sands exploration drilling  conventional oilfield fishing services  coil tubing fishing services  resonance technology solutions for stuck tubulars and land based oil and gas search and development 
the division s land based oil and gas search and development activities focus primarily on natural gas properties  principally coalbed methane projects located in the midwest region of the united states 
products and other this grouping has historically included the company s supply operation which distributed drilling equipment  parts and supplies  a manufacturing operation producing diamond drilling rigs  diamond bits  core barrels and drill rods christensen products and other miscellaneous operations which do not fall into the above divisions 
on january   the company sold its supply operations to boart longyear 
upon the sale  the results of operations were reclassified to discontinued operations for all years presented see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on august   the company sold its christensen products business to a subsidiary of atlas copco see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

the increase in unallocated corporate expenses was primarily the result of increased employee benefit and insurance premium costs 
fluctuation in quarterly results the company historically has experienced fluctuations in its quarterly results arising from the timing of the award and completion of contracts  the recording of related revenues and unanticipated additional costs incurred on projects 
the company s revenues on large  long term drilling contracts are recognized on a percentage of completion basis for individual contracts based upon the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
contract price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as work progresses and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenues and gross profit in the reporting period when such estimates are revised 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
a significant number of the company s contracts contain fixed prices and assign responsibility to the company for cost overruns for the subject projects  as a result  revenues and gross margin may vary from those originally estimated and  depending upon the size of the project  variations from estimated contract performance could affect the company s operating results for a particular quarter 
many of the company s contracts are also subject to cancellation by the customer upon short notice with limited damages payable to the company 
in addition  adverse weather conditions  natural disasters  force majeure and other similar events can curtail company operations in various regions of the world throughout the year  resulting in performance delays and increased costs 
moreover  the company s domestic drilling activities and related revenues and earnings tend to decrease in the winter months when adverse weather conditions interfere with access to drilling sites and the ability to drill  as a result  the company s revenues and earnings in its second and third quarters tend to be higher than revenues and earnings in its first and fourth quarters 
accordingly  as a result of the foregoing as well as other factors  quarterly results should not be considered indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any full fiscal year 
see the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
inflation management believes that the company s operations for the periods discussed have not been adversely affected by inflation or changing prices from its suppliers 
liquidity and capital resources the primary source of the company s liquidity in fiscal  and was its cash from operating activities of   and  respectively 
the decrease in cash from operations in was primarily attributable to incentive compensation payments paid in related to fiscal  note payments to ausdrill limited and payment of closing costs related to certain subsidiaries closed at the end of fiscal in fiscal  cash from operations was primarily used to pay debt issuance costs related to the credit agreement  a prepayment penalty on early redemption of the senior notes  and additions to property and equipment of  capital expenditures during the fiscal years were directed primarily toward expansion and upgrading of the company s equipment and facilities and the company s expansion into coalbed methane exploration and production 
in fiscal  the company expects to accelerate its expansion into the production of coalbed methane gas 
capital expenditure estimates for fiscal include up to  related to the company s coalbed methane development efforts and approximately  to upgrade equipment and facilities in the company s water resources  mineral exploration  and geoconstruction divisions 
as of january   the company had no material commitments outstanding for capital assets 
the company maintains a cash borrowing facility the credit agreement comprised of a term loan and a  revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the credit agreement were used to refinance borrowings outstanding under the company s previous credit facilities 
the company s borrowings under the credit agreement were  at january  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s working capital as of january   and  was   and  respectively 
working capital at january  was reduced by outstanding balances of  under its previous revolving credit facility  which was refinanced during the company believes it will have sufficient cash from operations and access to credit facilities to meet the company s operating cash requirements and to fund its budgeted capital expenditures for fiscal the company also expects to defray the cash cost of its fiscal incentive compensation awards by making a portion of the payments in common stock 
the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments are summarized as follows payments expiration by period less than total year years years contractual obligations and other commercial commitments debt     operating leases     ausdrill promissory note total contractual cash obligations     standby letters of credit   total contractual obligations and commercial commitments     critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accounting policies are more fully described in note to the financial statements  located elsewhere in this annual report on form k for the year ended january  we believe that the following represent our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized on large  long term contracts using the percentage of completion method based upon materials installed and labor costs incurred 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions  and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
goodwill and other intangibles in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 which was effective for the company as of february  sfas no 
substantially changes the accounting for goodwill  requiring that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives cease to be amortized  and  instead periodically tested for impairment 
this statement also requires that within six months of adoption  goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level as of the date of adoption 
as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements  the company had goodwill of  at january  the goodwill was primarily attributable to the company s mineral exploration division 
the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of the company s reporting units 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations  and assumptions about the company s strategic plans with regard to its operations 
the company completed the initial assessment of goodwill during the second quarter of fiscal year and determined a transitional impairment charge was required 
as a result  the company recorded a non cash charge of  which was recorded  net of taxes of  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with sfas no 
the company completed its annual impairment test as of december  and no further impairment was indicated 
we believe at this time that the carrying value of the remaining goodwill is appropriate  although to the extent additional information arises or the company s strategies change  it is possible that the company s conclusions regarding impairment of the remaining goodwill could change and result in a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
other long lived assets in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of long lived assets  we perform an analysis of the anticipated future net cash flows of the related long lived assets and reduce their carrying value by the excess  if any  of the result of such calculation 
we believe at january  that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives continue to be appropriate 
accrued insurance expense we record estimates for certain health and welfare  workers compensation  and casualty insurance costs that are self insured programs 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or costs of the medical profession increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional costs to the consolidated financial statements could be required 
costs estimated to be incurred in the future for employee medical benefits  workers compensation and casualty insurance programs resulting from claims which have occurred are accrued currently 
under the terms of the company s agreement with the various insurance carriers administering these claims  the company is not required to remit the total premium until the claims are actually paid by the insurance companies 
these costs are not expected to significantly impact liquidity in future periods see note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes income taxes are provided using the asset liability method  in which deferred taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability and valuation allowances are provided as necessary 
provision for us income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and foreign affiliates is made only on those amounts in excess of those funds considered to be invested indefinitely see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
litigation and other contingencies the company is involved in litigation incidental to its business  the disposition of which is expected to have no material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company s assumptions related to these proceedings 
the company accrues its best estimate of the probable cost for the resolution of legal claims 
such estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel handling these matters and are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
to the extent additional information arises or the company s strategies change  it is possible that the company s estimate of its probable liability in these matters may change 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and their impact on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks to which the company is exposed are interest rate risk on variable rate debt  equity risk on marketable investments  and foreign exchange rate risk that could give rise to translation and transaction gains and losses 
the company centrally manages its debt and investment portfolios considering overall financing strategies and tax consequences 
a description of the company s variable rate debt and an associated interest rate swap agreement appear in note to the consolidated financial statements of this form k 
assuming then existing debt levels and the swap agreement  an instantaneous change in interest rates of one percentage point would impact the company s annual interest expense by  and  at january  and  respectively 
the company s investments are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
marketable investments are carried at market value and are held for long term investing purposes rather than trading purposes 
operating in international markets involves exposure to possible volatile movements in currency exchange rates 
currently  the company s primary international operations are in australia  africa  mexico  canada and italy 
the operations are described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s affiliates also operate in chile  peru  mexico and panama see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the majority of the company s contracts in africa and mexico are us dollar based  providing a natural reduction in exposure to currency fluctuations 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of the company s international operations into us dollars may affect year to year comparability of operating results 
we estimate that a change in foreign exchange rates would not significantly impact income from continuing operations for the years ended january  and this quantitative measure has inherent limitations  as it does not take into account any governmental actions  changes in customer purchasing patterns or changes in the company s financing and operating strategies 
foreign exchange gains and losses in the company s consolidated statements of income reflect transaction gains and losses and translation gains and losses from the company s mexican and african operations which use the us dollar as their functional currency 
net foreign exchange gains and losses for  and were not significant
