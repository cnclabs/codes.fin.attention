interland s business is rapidly evolving as a result of the acquisitions detailed above

the company s annual hosting revenue growth has been the result of its acquisitions

as a result  the company does not believe its historical financial results are indicative of expected future results

corporate strategy interland s continuing strategic objective is to be the leading provider of standardized web hosting and online solutions to small and medium sized businesses 
the company intends to serve profitably its target market by maintaining scale and efficiency in its operations  while employing technology to deliver an attractive value proposition to its customers 
interland believes the most profitable segment of the web solutions and hosting market is serving small and medium sized businesses 
this market is large  growing  and may be served with standardized products and services 
standardization of products and services permits the use of standardized processes  and of a higher degree of automation in many areas of operation  including the web site design process 
this approach stands in sharp contrast to that of other web hosting companies  which focus on providing labor intensive  customized solutions to larger enterprises 
by delivering business class web solutions for smbs in a scalable and efficient manner  interland believes that it can offer better value to its customers  leading to growing market share and profits 
on the other hand  certain aspects of the smb market present substantial challenges and risks 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors interland s ability to significantly organically grow revenue is dependent on successful penetration of the mainstream market of small and medium sized businesses lacking an effective web presence 
at the beginning of fiscal year the company implemented a strategic plan designed to build the market leader in online solutions for smbs  aimed at targeting this high growth market opportunity 
a fundamental element of the plan was to develop a business model based on economies of scale resulting in attractive profit margins 
this three 
table of contents year strategic plan resulted in an intense acquisition phase followed by an equally intense integration phase in the first two years 
in fiscal  the company s objective was to achieve the scale required for profit rapidly through acquisitions  and begin the integration process 
in fiscal  the company s objective was to complete the integration process to reach attractive levels of positive ebitda and begin preparing the organic growth engine 
having successfully achieved the first two phases of the plan with the achievement of positive ebitda results in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company is now focused on the final phase of its original plan organic growth 
beginning in fiscal year  the company s focus is on organic growth by maintaining leadership in the early adopter market and by developing  testing and growing distribution channels for the offering and delivery of professionally designed web sites to the mainstream market 
products and services interland offers an integrated suite of web hosting  web site design  applications hosting and related business services designed to specifically address the needs of small and medium sized businesses 
these services include shared hosting  dedicated hosting and managed services  web site design services  web site promotion services  e commerce and other applications hosting services  domain name registration services  and other web hosting related products and services 
most of the company s hosting revenues are generated from recurring monthly fees 
the remainder is derived from one time setup fees for installation and other related product and services 
the company generally sells its services under agreements having terms of one to twenty four months  nonetheless  the customer may often be permitted to cancel during an initial thirty day period 
customers pay for the services either in a lump sum in advance  or monthly 
during fiscal  the company derived of its revenues from hosting and other hosting related services compared to in fiscal the balance of the revenues had been generated primarily by other network related services 
shared hosting shared hosting services range from entry level starter packages to business e commerce shared web hosting products 
interland s shared hosting packages minimize the cost for customers by providing hosting services for multiple customers on a single shared server  spreading the cost of the service over many users 
starter packages are designed for web sites with relatively low volumes of traffic and provide a web presence at minimal cost 
the company s products are scalable solutions that make it simple to upgrade to more full featured services 
the majority of the company s customers currently use its shared hosting services 
interland s services feature easy to use control panels and extensive on line documentation that allow customers to control easily their own applications 
business e commerce packages feature important e commerce services including secure socket layer encryption for e commerce transactions  shopping carts and database technology to conduct product and service sales online 
through some of the company s business relationships  its customers can also obtain merchant account and online payment processing services 
on september   the company introduced its bluehalo shared hosting architecture  which was designed to integrate network operations onto a common architecture and to implement a full suite of internal systems to support the company s hosting services 
key technical features of the bluehalo architecture include redundant firewall protection  load balancing  multiple web server arrays  duplicate network attached storage units and a disk backup system 
dedicated hosting in contrast to a shared hosting environment  which hosts multiple customers on one server  dedicated hosting employs one or more servers dedicated to a single customer 
dedicated hosting provides a customer with increased 
table of contents performance  server access  the ability to use custom applications  greater security and higher levels of technical support 
interland provides both managed and unmanaged dedicated services 
for managed dedicated hosting services  the company monitors  administers and troubleshoots the software that operates the client server 
for unmanaged dedicated hosting services  the customer administers the server remotely  with the company providing the hardware monitoring and network and hardware support 
dedicated hosting services are targeted for web sites that generally require sophisticated databases for critical application needs or typically experience high user traffic volumes 
the company s managed services are targeted to those who need the complex services required for mission critical web sites  but do not want to administer their own server 
the dedicated services come with proprietary control panel technology  which enables customers to setup and maintain web sites on the server 
interland offers dedicated web hosting services for major computer platforms  including microsoft nt  windows and linux 
since its acquisition of dialtone  interland has achieved a leadership position in the dedicated hosting market 
web site design services following its acquisition of trellix  interland recently introduced professional web site development services 
this expansion of our services beyond our core hosting products is a recognition of the market s evolving dynamics 
industry analysts estimate that nearly of all smbs in the united states do not have a web presence 
the company believes that the primary barriers to adoption of online solutions by smbs have been their lack of technical expertise and the cost barrier to trial  that is  the initial cost of developing a web site 
today  before being able to evaluate the benefits of a solid online presence  an smb would have to expend thousands of dollars or devote numerous hours to deploy complex technology 
as a result  penetration has remained low 
the company believes that the key to penetrating the estimated million smbs who have no online presence and those among the million whose online presence is not regarded as effective is to deliver an affordable and easy to use total solution 
the company refers to this business opportunity as the mainstream market 
although our core hosting business is limited to providing hosting services only to customers that already have a web site  with the new software tools available since the acquisition of trellix  the company is able to target smbs without a web site 
interland s in house designers use the suite of trellix development tools to build full featured  professional smb web sites 
interland designed web site functionality includes features such as e commerce  scheduling  auctions  online chat and coupons 
because the design tool was developed with non technical end users in mind  customers are able to make simple changes to their web sites and manage their online presence 
web site promotion services in order to benefit fully from a professional web presence  smbs need assistance in promoting their web site 
interland offers a broad range of online marketing and promotions services  including online search  directory registration  email and coupon marketing 
interland is targeting the mainstream smb market with a unique value proposition offering a bundle of services  site hosting as well as professional design  all for an attractive fixed monthly cost 
e commerce and other applications hosting services interland s applications hosting services allow customers to outsource to it the deployment  configuration  hosting  management and support of various software applications 
the company s applications hosting services allow customers to deploy a software application more quickly and with reduced initial costs 
in addition  many small and medium sized businesses do not have the internal technical resources to support multiple software applications 
the company therefore believes that outsourcing these functions to it is a desirable alternative for these businesses 
the types of applications the company hosts for customers include collaboration tools  business tools  mail service tools and e commerce applications 
currently  the applications that the company hosts consist of web site building tools  online storefront and e commerce solutions and a suite of managed services all of which help businesses succeed online 
other web hosting related products and services interland also makes available other complementary products and services including domain name registration and technical consulting 
the company believes these value added products and services enable it to provide its 
table of contents customers the necessary tools to create  host and maintain a successful web presence 
the company believes that the outsourcing of these functions is a desirable and increasingly preferred alternative for smbs

mainstream market services channels since its acquisition of trellix  the company has been developing sales channels aimed at distributing its new integrated online solutions services 
these channels include a direct sales force  online and telephone sales 
the company also intends to test a variety of other distribution channels 
direct sales force based on in depth market research  the company concluded that the best way to develop an effective portfolio of distribution channels to the mainstream market was to first establish a direct sales effort 
this way  the company would be able to control all aspects of this channel s development as well as be as close as possible to its target customers 
as a result  starting in the spring of  the company began building a direct sales force dedicated to the mainstream market 
the company is planning on continuing the rollout of this sales force through fiscal year online and telephone sales in parallel with the development of its direct mainstream sales force  the company is leveraging its experience in online and telephone sales by making this new suite of products available through these established channels 
other mainstream sales channels during the course of fiscal  the company intends on testing a number of other potential distribution channels for its mainstream solutions 
potential channel candidates include retail partners  sales seminars  strategic partners  agents and franchisees 
the company also intends to leverage its network of thousands of hosting resellers 
the company s objective for is to identify and begin implementing complementary distribution channels enabling it to cost effectively distribute its suite of integrated online solutions to the mainstream smb market

other marketing activities include participation in industry events and affiliate relationships  including cooperative marketing with related services

these relationships enable the company to more quickly gain access to innovative technologies  to provide more creative solutions for its customers and to allow it to offer its customers resources that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive for them to acquire

the company believes that these relationships will enable it to continue to provide its customers with the necessary tools to create  host and maintain a successful web presence and to have access to sophisticated e commerce and applications solutions 
these relationships also provide the company with opportunities to market to customers to which it might not otherwise have access 
microsoft corporation interland is a microsoft certified solution partner and is currently engaged in several initiatives with microsoft  including developing windows server product offerings and promotions for both dedicated and shared hosting customers

as of august   the company had approximately  paid shared hosting customer accounts and managed nearly  dedicated servers compared to  paid shared hosting customer accounts and  dedicated servers as of august  additionally  the company hosts web sites under plans formerly marketed by trellix 
network infrastructure  technology and operations to provide a secure and reliable hosting environment  interland has constructed a managed infrastructure  consisting of data centers  a redundant internet communications backbone  enterprise management software and an advanced network 
data centers the company has a total of almost  square feet of data center floor space 
these data centers  located in atlanta  georgia  sq 
ft  miami  florida  sq

proprietary technology in addition to the bluehalo architecture  interland has developed various proprietary technologies that are designed to allow customers to order  change and manage their web hosting accounts easily regardless of their level of technical expertise 
proprietary technologies also enable the company to automate a number of back end functions and processes 
for example  the company s provisioning system automatically activates customer initiated web site changes within minutes of its entry 
the company s administration page technology lets customers modify their web sites from the internet without having to contact the company s support staff 
this technology provides the company with the opportunity to achieve greater operational efficiencies and allows the customer to change passwords  protect specific directories  and to create database sources without the assistance of the company s technical support staff 
although the company believes that its suite of technology offers its customers significant benefits  the company does not believe that its competitive advantage materially depends upon protected intellectual property 
network operations centers interland monitors its network operations hours a day  every day of the year with technical experts in windows and linux operating platforms 
the network operations center personnel monitor each piece of equipment  including routers  switches and servers  as well as all internet and communication connections

international revenues are denominated and paid in us dollars 
these amounts represent revenues from international customers generated and supported in the us as the company has no network operations outside of the united states 
competition interland believes that the primary competitive factors in the technical segment of its business are reliability  technical support and price 
although the market is intensely competitive  the company believes that it compares favorably with its competition on these dimensions 
in the smb mainstream market segment  the company believes that critical success factors are the bundling of a complete web site design and hosting solution combined with a personalized approach to sales and customer support 
the company believes it is unique in the marketplace in its offering of such a service at a price attractive to the majority of smbs 
the smb hosting market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors  most of which have market share of less than 
interland believes it has a market share of approximately  placing the company in the industry s leading position  and that its next closest competitor is ntt verio 
a number of other companies offer web hosting in addition to their core products and services 
current and potential competitors in the market include web hosting service providers  applications hosting providers  internet service providers  telecommunications companies  large information technology firms that provide a wide array of information technology services  computer hardware suppliers and internet centric companies 
the company does not consider itself to be in direct competition with companies such as ibm  digex  globix or navisite 
those companies provide high end services that are highly customized  require the user to have technical expertise and generally charge several thousand dollars per month 
interland s solutions are standardized  do not require the user to have technical expertise  and generally sell for less than per month 
interland believes that it can sell standardized solutions to a larger customer base on a more efficient and profitable basis than can providers of high end  customized solutions 
intellectual property interland relies on a combination of laws including patent  copyright  trademark  service mark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in its services 
as of august   the company owned eight issued us patents and had several additional patent applications on file but not yet issued 
interland has entered into confidentiality and other agreements with its employees and contractors  including agreements in which the employees and contractors assign their rights in inventions to it

nonetheless  neither the intellectual property laws nor contractual arrangements  nor any of the other steps the company has taken to protect its intellectual property can ensure that others will not use its technology or that others will not develop similar technologies 
interland licenses or leases many technologies used in its internet application services 
the company expects that it and its customers increasingly will be subject to third party infringement claims as the number of web sites and third party service providers for web based businesses grows 
although the company does not believe that its technologies or services infringe the proprietary rights of any third parties  the company cannot ensure that third parties will not assert claims against it in the future or that these claims will not be successful 
although it has discontinued operations as a manufacturer of personal computers in the electronics industry  the company is nonetheless subject to litigation arising from its past activities 
it is not uncommon in the electronics industry for patent  trademark and other intellectual property rights claims to be asserted against companies  including component suppliers and personal computer manufacturers 
periodically  the company is made aware that technology it has used in these discontinued operations may have infringed on intellectual property rights held by others 
the company has evaluated all such claims and  if necessary and appropriate  sought to obtain licenses for the use of such technology 
if the company or its suppliers were unable to obtain licenses necessary to use 
table of contents intellectual property in its discontinued operations products or processes  it may be legally liable to the owner of such intellectual property 
moreover  even in those instances where the company is justified in denying claims that it has infringed on the intellectual property rights of others  it may nonetheless be forced to defend legal actions taken against the company relating to allegedly protected technology  and such legal actions may require the company to expend substantial funds

government regulation interland is not currently subject to direct federal  state or local government regulation  other than regulations that generally apply to publicly registered businesses 
this could change in the future see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors interland s business operates in an uncertain legal environment where future government regulation and lawsuits could restrict interland s business or cause unexpected losses

in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  the company believes it has adequately reserved for the contingencies arising from the above legal matters where an outcome was deemed to be probable and the loss amount could be reasonably estimated

the company has a limited operating history as a provider of standardized business class online solutions to smbs 
the company s revenue growth is attributable to its acquisitions 
as a result  the company does not believe its historical financial results are indicative of expected future results 
the company does not anticipate making further acquisitions as a means of growing revenue  but rather it intends to pursue organic growth strategies  including execution of its plans to offer combined web site design  development  and management tools to small and medium sized businesses  also referred to as its mainstream market initiative 
critical accounting policies and estimates management based this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation of accounts receivable  property  plant and equipment  long lived assets  intangible assets  and contingencies 
estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 

table of contents the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
these judgments and estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
revenue recognition revenues from continuing operations are primarily generated from shared and dedicated internet web hosting  managed services  e commerce services  applications hosting  domain name registrations  and web site development services 
revenues are recognized as the services are provided 
hosting contracts generally are for service periods ranging from one to twenty four months and sometimes require up front set up fees  which are deferred and recognized ratably over the customers first year of service 
deferred revenues represent the liability for advance billings to customers for services not yet provided 
the company may permit an early termination of a term contract subject to penalties 
valuation of accounts receivable judgment is required when the company assesses the likelihood of ultimate realization of recorded accounts receivable  including assessing the likelihood of collection and the credit worthiness of customers 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate or their operating climate were to change  resulting in an impairment of either their ability or willingness to make payments  an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts would be required 
similarly  a change in the payment behavior of customers generally may require an adjustment in the calculation of an appropriate allowance 
the majority of customer payments are made by credit card 
each month management reviews customer payment patterns  historical credit card charge backs  customer cancellation trends  and comparative aged receivables balances in order to determine the appropriate amount of allowance for doubtful accounts receivable to record 
as a result of these analyses  the company believes that the current allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is adequate to cover a reasonably expected level of un collectible accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date 
property  plant  equipment and long lived assets the company utilizes significant amounts of property  plant and equipment in providing service to its customers 
for financial statement reporting purposes  the company uses straight line depreciation for property and equipment over our estimate of their useful lives 
the company uses estimated useful lives of three to seven years for equipment and software 
changes in technology or changes in the intended use of property  plant and equipment may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change 
the company performs an annual analysis to confirm the appropriateness of estimated economic useful lives for each category of property  plant  and equipment 
additionally  long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  the company periodically evaluates goodwill and intangible assets for potential impairment 
the company tests for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets annually by determining whether the company s carrying value exceeds its fair value 
fair value is ascertained by using quoted values of the company s stock and by using discounted values of expected future cash flows 
if impairment of carrying value based on the calculated fair value exists  the company measures the impairment through the use of discounted cash flows 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions  and operational considerations 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and other intangible assets associated with acquired businesses are impaired 
goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead is subject to impairment tests at least annually 
the company generally performs the annual test on may st 
other intangible assets are amortized over an estimate of their period of benefit 
contingencies the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to class action lawsuits and other legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes of these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of the loss accrual required  if any  for these contingencies  is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the company consults with legal counsel and other experts where necessary to assess any 
table of contents contingencies 
the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
discontinued operations during fiscal  the company discontinued the operations of its pc systems and spectek business segments 
these segments have been accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with apb no 
and in this regard an estimate of all retained liabilities was recorded 
the amounts recorded as of the subsequent reported balance sheet dates represent the estimated remaining liabilities 
these amounts are subject to final settlement  which could result in a revision to the estimated loss on the final disposal of these discontinued operations 
related amounts in the financial statements and corresponding notes for all periods presented have been classified as part of discontinued operations 
restructuring and acquisition related liabilities the company has remaining reserves related to our restructuring program approved and implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal year in connection with our acquisition of interland ga 
the company also incurred liabilities related to the integration of acquired business during fiscal and these remaining liabilities represent our estimate of future lease payments for data centers and office facilities being exited that cannot be recovered through subleases  employee termination  and termination penalties for bandwidth and data connectivity contracts we are no longer utilizing 
results of continuing operations the company s consolidated financial information presents the net effect of discontinued operations separate from the results of the company s continuing operations

net proceeds from the sale of the spectek assets under the purchase agreement were million 
comparison of the years ended august    and revenues total revenues increased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal fiscal year ended august  august  august  revenues hosting revenue other revenue total revenue hosting revenues increased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal hosting revenues are comprised of shared  dedicated  and application hosting services and domain name registrations 
the growth in hosting revenues  which is attributable to acquisitions  continues to be partially offset by account cancellations  net of new customers obtained through sales and marketing activities 
these cancellations occur as a result of a customer action  b termination by the company for non payment  or c termination by the company as a result of a decision to no longer provide a particular service 
the company has not  during its current acquisition and integration phases  focused on organic growth  and has as a result of increased efficiency  reduced its spending on marketing and advertising from the amounts spent in fiscal consequently  the company has  aside from acquisitions  yet to achieve sustained overall growth in revenue 
the company does not expect to make further acquisitions  although the recent acquisition of hostcentric is expected to provide additional revenue 
the company does expect to achieve modest organic revenue growth sometime during fiscal in both its core hosting business and its mainstream market initiative by which it will offer web site design  development  and management tools to small and medium sized businesses 
the increase from to was primarily related to the additional subscribers obtained from various acquisitions made by the company 
other revenues increased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal  which had decreased from million in fiscal other revenues are primarily comprised of consulting  internet connectivity fees  co location services  and web based business solution services 
the increase in other revenues during fiscal is due to an increase in consulting services and the inclusion of trellix revenues  partially offset by a decrease in co location services revenue 
the decrease from to was the result of the sale of consumer dial up accounts in and and the company s strategy to move away from the sale of hardware 
as of august   the company had approximately  paid shared hosting customer accounts and managed nearly  dedicated servers many of which host multiple web sites compared to  paid shared hosting customer accounts and  dedicated servers at august  the decrease in shared hosting customer accounts is primarily due to customer churn caused by breakage experienced as accounts were migrated to other data centers during the integration process  as well as the company s more stringent termination policies 
table of contents applied to delinquent accounts 
the increase in dedicated servers is primarily attributable to the hostcentric acquisition and improved sales performance 
operating costs and expenses network operating costs network operating costs decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which had increased from million in fiscal the decrease in networking operating costs is most directly related to the data center consolidation  which was a critical part of the company s restructuring and integration initiative 
that initiative also accounted for a million reduction in bandwidth connectivity costs  a million reduction in service fees  and a million reduction in employee related costs 
in addition the company reduced operating lease costs by million as a result of purchasing the underlying leased equipment 
these cost savings were partially offset by a million increase in software costs necessary to support customer product offerings  a million increase in repair and maintenance costs to maintain network reliability  a million increase in professional fees to upgrade network security  and a million increase in domain registration costs 
the increase from to was primarily related to expenses such as rent  telecommunications and internet access costs from acquired companies and their associated data center facilities 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses decreased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal  which had increased from million in fiscal the company s sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to during fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in sales and marketing expenses is directly attributable to functional centralization and much greater use of on line advertising and customer initiated on line sales  and a reduction in reliance on more expensive print advertising and direct mail 
the increase from to reflects the addition of the sales and marketing cost structure of the companies acquired during technical support technical support expenses decreased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal  which had increased from million in fiscal the company s technical support expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to during fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in technical support costs is caused by a million reduction in service fees paid to third party providers for support of acquired accounts  a million reduction in professional fee expenses associated with process reengineering initiatives  a million reduction in employee related expenses  and million savings in repairs and maintenance costs 
partially offsetting these reductions were increases in contracted labor expenses of million and occupancy expenses of million 
the increase from to reflected the additional resources needed to support the increased size of the customer account base generated by company acquisitions 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal  which had increased from million in fiscal the company s general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to during fiscal from in fiscal and down from in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to a million increase in professional fees primarily related to process improvements  the initial design requirements of a new billing system and the development of the mainstream market initiative  a million increase in legal fees associated with litigation arising from the integration of recent acquisitions and related security registrations costs  an additional million in salary and benefit costs associated with the acquired workforces of innerhost  trellix  and hostcentric  a million increase in staffing relocation costs necessary to complete consolidation initiatives  and a million increase in premiums for director and officer liability insurance 
partially offsetting these increases was a million decrease in occupancy costs associated with office consolidation  a million decrease in allocated service fees  and a million decrease in communication costs as a result of renegotiated contracts with telecom providers 
the increase from to was primarily related to increased administrative costs attributable to the acquisitions made by the company and an adjustment to reserves required for disposal of abandoned facilities 

table of contents bad debt expense bad debt expense decreased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal  which had increased from million in fiscal the company s bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues decreased to during fiscal from in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in bad debt expense is directly attributable to the implementation of more aggressive collection strategies and more stringent non paying account deactivation termination policies 
generally services are suspended when an account becomes thirty days past due and services are terminated if an account ages beyond sixty days 
the increase in bad debt expense during fiscal was primarily related to the acquisitions of customer accounts of interland ga  communitech 
net  dialtone  interliant  and at t 
following these transactions the company experienced short term customer churn and breakage during the account integration and migration process 
in connection with the acquisition of interland ga and the restructuring plan  which included the consolidation of data centers and internal business systems  the company also addressed internal customer credit and billing function issues 
the combination of higher than expected customer churn and the integration and consolidation of our billing and collection functions during the year resulted in unusually high bad debt expense for the year ended august  in response to the higher bad debt expense  the company increased its collection efforts in the third quarter of fy to bring the past due accounts back down to a more normal level 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal  which had increased from million in fiscal the company s depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to during fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in annual depreciation and amortization expense is due to a million of accelerated depreciation on the assets associated with closed data centers in seattle  los angeles and kansas city  b million of accelerated amortization of software products acquired through business combinations  and  c million additional depreciation and amortization charges associated with acquired entities and purchased assets 
the increase from to was primarily related to depreciation of acquired data centers and equipment  increased amortization expense pertaining to the acquisition of customer accounts 
this amortization can arise both from transactions in which we acquire only customer accounts and from acquisitions of customer accounts in connection with the acquisition of a corporation through merger or stock purchase 
restructuring costs restructuring costs increased to million during fiscal from a million gain in fiscal  which had decreased from million in fiscal during fiscal the company adopted a consolidation and restructuring plan  which led to the closure of redundant data centers and the consequent establishment and recording of appropriate reserves 
the restructuring costs in fiscal year were composed of million for the termination of bandwidth connectivity contracts  million for facility lease termination charges  million for equipment related charges and million for employee related severance expenses 
during fiscal the company recognized a write down of million against the restructuring reserve established in august coincident with the acquisition of interland georgia 
this write down pertained to the settlement of a previously disputed tenant improvement allowance  settlement of bandwidth connectivity contracts for less than previously estimated  and the assignment of certain other data connectivity contracts to a third party 
during the fourth quarter of  the company approved and implemented a restructuring program in connection with its acquisition of interland georgia 
this finalized restructuring plan  for which all payments are expected to be completed by december st   provides for the consolidation of the company s operations and elimination of duplicative facilities obtained as a result of previous business acquisitions 
in accordance with eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit and activity  the restructuring costs  excluding asset impairments  were recognized as liabilities at the time management committed to the plan 
management determined that these costs provided no future economic benefit  they were incremental to other costs incurred by the company prior to the restructuring  or were contractual obligations that existed prior to the date the plan was approved and were either continued after the exit plan was completed with no economic benefit to the company or were non cancelable without a penalty  and they were incurred as a direct result of the plan to exit the identified activities 
the asset impairments were accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of

the plan provided for the closure of three data center facilities  a reduction of those related workforces of approximately employees  and the termination of bandwidth and data connectivity contracts in place at these and other facilities 
the company exited all three data centers by june the following table shows a reconciliation of the beginning and ending liability balances from august  through august   related to all restructuring activities recorded by the company under both of the restructuring programs described in the above two paragraphs

the company s market price of its stock has experienced significant volatility over the last fiscal year and closed as of august   with a market value significantly less that the value at the beginning of the fiscal year 
management retained valuation specialists to assist in the valuation of its tangible and identifiable intangible assets for purposes of determining the implied fair value of goodwill at may  upon completion of the annual assessment  interland recorded a non cash impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its estimated fair value of million 
intangible asset impairment the company s aggressive acquisition strategy over the last two years resulted in significant accumulated customer and product related intangible asset balances 
the company continued to monitor the performance of these acquired identifiable intangible assets  and during the third quarter the company determined that the related discounted present value of future cash flows from its interliant  at t and burlee customer account acquisitions  as well as the value of the customer relationship intangible assets from its communitech 
net  innerhost and dialtone acquisitions were materially less than previously estimated  due primarily to customer cancellations and company initiated account terminations 
as a result of this assessment  the company determined that these identifiable intangible assets were worth less than their carrying value  and the company consequently recorded a non cash impairment charge of million to reduce the asset value to its newly assessed value

the cause for the increase in net interest expense is primarily due to the lower levels of funds available for investment and lower interest rates experienced during fiscal and income tax provision the effective income tax expense rate on continuing operations was approximately for fiscal  compared to an effective income tax benefit rate of for fiscal and benefit of for fiscal giving rise to the income tax expense in fiscal is an adjustment to a previously recorded tax benefit receivable 
the effective rates principally reflect the federal statutory rate  net of the effect of state taxes  tax exempt securities and non deductible goodwill amortization 
the change in the effective income tax rates primarily reflects tax benefits resulting from a change in the internal revenue code regarding the carry back of net operating losses  as well as a valuation allowance on certain tax assets 
on march   a tax law entitled the job creation and worker assistance act of was passed

table of contents the ability to carry back tax losses to the previous five years

earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda ebitda is defined as net income from continuing operations less i interest income or expense  ii income taxes  and iii depreciation and amortization 
ebitda is not an indicator of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and may not be comparable to similarly captioned information reported by other companies 
in addition  it does not replace net income loss  operating income loss  or cash flows from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity 
the effect of taxes and interest on interland s net loss is not significant  but depreciation and amortization  primarily as a result of acquisitions  is significant 
the company believes that measuring the performance of the business without regard to non cash depreciation and amortization can make trends in operating results more readily apparent  and when considered with other information  assist investors and other users of the company s financial statements who wish to evaluate the company s ability to generate future cash flows 
the company s ebitda loss increased to a loss of million during fiscal from losses of million in fiscal  which had decreased from losses of million in fiscal the primary cause for the increased ebitda loss during fiscal was the million and million asset impairment charges recorded against goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  respectively 
the decrease in the ebitda loss from to was due to the successful execution of the company s merger  integration and restructuring plans  in conjunction with additional revenues and gross margins for the periods offset by increased sales  technical support  general and administrative personnel costs pertaining to and generated by the company s acquisitions of interland ga  communitech

management believes that the pre split share count of approximately million shares was too high for a company of interland s size  and that a reduced share count will permit meaningful changes in net income in the future to be reflected in meaningful changes in earning per share

fin clarified the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated support from other parties

risk factors you should carefully consider the following factors and all other information contained in this form k for the fiscal year ending august  before you make any investment decisions with respect to the company s securities 
the risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only risks the company faces 
interland has incurred losses since inception and could incur losses in the future 
interland has incurred net losses and losses from operations for all but one of each quarterly period from its inception through the fourth quarter of fiscal a number of factors could increase its operating expenses  such as adapting network infrastructure and administrative resources to accommodate additional customers and future growth  developing products  distribution  marketing  and management for the mainstream market  
table of contents broadening customer technical support capabilities  and improving network security features 
to the extent that increases in expenses are not offset by increases in revenues  operating losses will increase 
ours is a recurring revenue subscriber business and as such the effects of a net loss of monthly recurring revenue are magnified 
a large majority of our revenue is derived from the monthly recurring charges mrc incurred by owners of hosted websites 
accordingly  the termination of a single account paying per month will affect revenue every month in the future 
the loss of such a customer at the beginning of a fiscal year will result in a twelve fold reduction in revenue for that fiscal year  and the loss of even one such customer each month of the fiscal year will result in a diminution of times the monthly recurring revenue  or  over the entire fiscal year 
absent the addition of customers through acquisitions  interland has consistently incurred a net loss in mrc  and this situation may continue with material negative effects on reported revenue and net income 
although reductions in mrc may be offset for a time by increases in revenue derived from one time or non recurring charges  the compounding effect of mrc losses will almost certainly eventually result in a meaningful reduction of reported revenue 
moreover  because of interland s relatively low percentage of variable costs  a concomitantly high percentage of the amount of revenue loss results in a loss of ebitda and of net income 
there can be no assurance that interland s efforts to reduce the loss of mrc will be successful 
because interland s historical financial information is not representative of its future results  investors and analysts will have difficulty analyzing interland s future earnings potential 
because the company has grown through acquisition and its past operating results reflect the costs of integrating these acquisitions  historical results are not representative of future expected operating results 
furthermore  the company s historical annual financial results reflect only the partial impacts of recent acquisitions 
in addition  because the company will be seeking to drive revenue growth primarily through its mainstream market initiative  which is a new market for the company  it will be challenging to predict future revenues 
as a result  investors and their advisors will find it challenging to predict future operating income 
interland has a limited operating history and its business model is still evolving  which makes it difficult to evaluate its prospects 
interland s limited operating history makes evaluating its business operations and prospects difficult 
its range of service offerings has changed since inception and its business model is still developing 
interland has changed from being primarily a seller of personal computers and related accessories to being primarily a web hosting and web based value added business solutions provider to small and medium sized businesses company 
because some of its services are new  the market for them is uncertain 
as a result  the revenues and income potential of its business  as well as the potential benefits of its acquisitions  may be difficult to evaluate 
quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate  which could cause interland s stock price to be volatile 
past operating results have fluctuated significantly on a quarterly and an annual basis 
quarterly and annual operating results may continue to significantly fluctuate due to a wide variety of factors 
because of these fluctuations  comparing operating results from period to period is not necessarily meaningful  and it would not be meaningful to rely upon such comparisons as an indicator of future performance 
factors that may cause its operating results to fluctuate include  but are not limited to demand for and market acceptance of the company s services and products  introduction of new services or enhancements by interland or its competitors  costs of implementing new network security features  crm systems  and billing modules  technical difficulties or system downtime affecting the internet generally or its hosting operations specifically  
table of contents customer retention  increased competition and consolidation within the web hosting and applications hosting markets  changes in its pricing policies and the pricing policies of its competitors  and gains or losses of key strategic partner relationships 
interland cannot provide any assurances that it will succeed in its plans to increase the size of its customer base  the amount of services it offers  or its revenues during the next fiscal year and beyond 
in addition  relatively large portions of its expenses are fixed in the short term  and therefore its results of operations are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in revenues 
also  if it cannot continue using third party products in its service offerings  its service development costs could increase significantly 
interland s stock price may be volatile which could cause an investment in its common stock to decrease significantly 
the market price of its common stock has experienced a significant decline 
the price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
the following are examples of factors or developments that would likely cause the company s stock price to continue to be volatile variations in operating results and analyst earnings estimates  the volatility of stock within the sectors within which it conducts business  announcements by interland or its competitors regarding introduction of new services  general decline in economic conditions  reductions in the volume of trading in its common stock and  the company s inability to reduce the rate of account cancellations  or to increase the rate of account additions  or both 
during the weeks ended august   the high and low closing price for interland common stock on nasdaq was and  respectively 
interland operates in a new and evolving market with uncertain prospects for growth and may not be able to generate and sustain growth in its customer base 
the market for web hosting and applications hosting services for small and medium sized businesses  and especially for the mainstream solutions  has only recently begun to develop and is evolving rapidly 
interland s future growth  if any  will depend upon the willingness of small and medium sized businesses to purchase web and applications services  interland s ability to increase or at least maintain its average monthly revenue per user arpu  and its ability to retain its core customer base 
for the fiscal year  interland s average monthly revenue per customer account was for shared hosting services and for dedicated hosting services 
these figures  when compared to those of prior periods  reflect the stability of the shared hosting arpu and the decline in dedicated hosting arpus made possible by sharp declines in the past few years of hardware and bandwidth prices  enabling the company to lower dedicated service prices while maintaining attractive margins 
for the fiscal year  interland s average monthly customer turnover was for shared hosting services and for dedicated hosting services 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  the company s average monthly churn was less than for shared hosting and less than for dedicated hosting 
the higher levels of customer churn experienced in the subsequent quarters are believed to be the direct result of the company s integration activities in the second and third quarters of fiscal when the company shut down seven of its data center facilities  moved over  servers to its current facilities and migrated more than of the shared customer base 
the market for interland s services may not develop further and consumers may not widely adopt its services 
if this market fails to develop further or develops more slowly than expected  or if interland s services do not achieve broader market 
table of contents acceptance  interland will not be able to grow its customer base 
in addition  interland must be able to differentiate itself from its competition through its service offerings and brand recognition 
these activities may be more expensive than interland anticipates  and interland may not succeed in differentiating itself from its competitors  achieving market acceptance of its services  or selling additional services to its existing customer base 
interland s ability to significantly organically grow revenue is dependent on successful penetration of the mainstream market of small and medium sized businesses lacking an effective web presence 
the mainstream market of small and medium sized businesses lacking an effective web presence has only been evaluated with limited market research and trials 
in addition  the company is dependent upon the successful broader market introduction of the company s software based web site development product offerings 
delays in seizing this market initiative and or in the related product introduction will limit the company s future revenue growth 
interland s mainstream market initiative could cause losses for interland  particularly within the next fiscal year 
the company has initiated a product line and marketing program directed at the mainstream market of smbs without an effective web presence 
this initiative is described in detail at item business 
the company is committing substantial resources to this initiative  and if it is unsuccessful in obtaining a significant number of new customers in this market  the company could suffer substantial net losses 
in addition  this is a new product line  and the products and services in this line may prove unprofitable to the company unless it is successful in implementing them and achieving economies of scale 
even if the company is successful in these efforts  the company anticipates that the introduction of the new line will contribute net losses and negative cash flow from continuing operations through at least fiscal year while the company completes the implementation of the new services and achieves a sufficient volume of business to cover the additional fixed costs 
because interland s target markets are volatile  the company may face a loss of customers or a high level of non collectible accounts 
the company intends to continue to concentrate on serving the small and medium sized business market 
this market contains many businesses that may not be successful  and consequently present a substantially greater risk for non collectible accounts receivable and for non renewal 
moreover  a significant portion of this target market is highly sensitive to price  and may be lost to a competitor with a lower pricing structure 
because few businesses in this target market employ trained technologists  they tend to generate a high number of customer service and technical support calls 
the expense of responding to these calls is considerable  and the expense is likely to increase in direct proportion to revenue  potentially limiting the scalability of the business 
additionally  if the customer becomes dissatisfied with the company s response to such calls  cancellation  non payment  or non renewal becomes more likely 
interland s strategy for minimizing the negative aspects of its target market include increased expenditures on sales and marketing programs to replace failing customers  capitalizing on infrastructure efficiencies to become a profitable provider at the lowest sustainable price  automating customer care and technical support to reduce the cost per call  and to minimize the time spent by company personnel  and  intensive training and supervision of customer care and technical support personnel to maximize customer satisfaction 
the company can give no assurance  however  that any of these measures will be successful  and the company s failure to manage these risks could decrease revenues and profitability 
interland could incur liabilities in the future relating to its pc systems business  which could cause additional operating losses 
interland could incur liabilities from the sale of the pc systems business to gtg pc 
according to the terms of its agreement with gtg pc  it retained liabilities relating to the operation of the pc systems business prior to the 
table of contents closing of the transaction including liabilities for taxes  contingent liabilities and liabilities for accounts payable accrued prior to the closing 
it also agreed to indemnify gtg pc and its affiliates for any breach of its representations and warranties contained in the agreement for a period of two years  or for the applicable statute of limitations for matters related to taxes 
its indemnification obligation is capped at million 
except for claims for fraud or injunctive relief  this indemnity is the exclusive remedy for any breach of its representations  warranties and covenants contained in the agreement with gtg pc 
accordingly  it could be required in the future to make payments to gtg pc and its affiliates in accordance with the agreement  which could adversely affect its future results of operations and cash flows 
to date it has not had to satisfy any such claims 
because interland faces intense competition  it may not be able to operate profitably in its markets 
the web hosting and applications hosting markets are highly competitive  which could hinder interland s ability to successfully market its products and services 
the company may not have the resources  expertise or other competitive factors to compete successfully in the future 
because there are few substantial barriers to entry  the company expects that it will face additional competition from existing competitors and new market entrants in the future 
many of interland s current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry and greater resources 
as a result  these competitors may be able to develop and expand their network infrastructures and service offerings more rapidly  adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements more quickly  and  devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their services and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than the company can 
current and potential competitors in the market include web hosting service providers  applications hosting providers  internet service providers  telecommunications companies  large information technology firms and computer hardware suppliers 
these competitors may operate in one or more of these areas and include companies such as ntt verio  affinity internet  and earthlink 
impairment of interland s intellectual property rights could negatively affect its business or could allow competitors to minimize any advantage that interland s proprietary technology may give it 
the company currently has no patented technology that would preclude or inhibit competitors from entering the web hosting market that it serves 
while it is the company s practice to enter into agreements with all employees and with some of its customers and suppliers to prohibit or restrict the disclosure of proprietary information  the company cannot be sure that these contractual arrangements or the other steps it takes to protect its proprietary rights will prove sufficient to prevent illegal use of its proprietary rights or to deter independent  third party development of similar proprietary assets 
effective copyright  trademark  trade secret and patent protection may not be available in every country in which its products and services are offered 
interland currently is  and in the future may be  involved in legal disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of its intellectual property rights or those of a third party 
intellectual property litigation is typically extremely costly and can be disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel 
in addition  any adverse decisions could subject it to significant liabilities  require it to seek licenses from others  prevent it from using  licensing or selling certain of its products and services  or cause severe disruptions to operations or the markets in which it competes which could decrease profitability 
periodically  it is made aware of claims  or potential claims  that technology it used in its discontinued operations may have infringed on intellectual property rights held by others 
the company has accrued a liability and charged operations for the estimated costs of settlement or adjudication of several asserted and unasserted claims for alleged infringement relating to its discontinued operations prior to the balance sheet date 
resolution of these claims could be costly and decrease profitability 

table of contents unfavorable results of existing litigation may cause interland to have additional expenses or operating losses 
interland is defending an employee class action lawsuit filed in the us district court for idaho 
in this case  five individual plaintiffs claim that when they were employees of micron electronics inc mei between and april  they and other similarly situated employees did not receive overtime pay to which they were entitled under the fair labor standards act 
interland disputes these claims and believes the plaintiffs are not entitled to any material additional wages 
the opt in period for potential class members has closed and discovery continues on the merits of the case 
interland believes that expenses or losses associated with the case will not have a material adverse effect on interland 
this potential liability remains with interland even though it sold the pc systems business 
in february of  the company filed a lawsuit in cobb county  georgia against mr 
gabriel murphy  one of the former principals of interland s subsidiary  communitech 
net  inc communitech  which was acquired by interland in february the company s lawsuit claims  among other things  that mr

kocher made inaccurate disclosures in connection with interland s acquisition of communitech 
the complaint asks for compensatory and punitive damages in an unspecified amount 
interland believes that these claims are without merit and will not have a material adverse effect on interland and intends to vigorously defend the claims 
on march   halo management  llc  filed a suit against interland in the us district court for the northern district of california 
the suit alleges that interland s use of bluehalo us patent and trademark office serial no

 registration no 

the suit seeks a permanent injunction against interland s use of its bluehalo mark and money damages 
in a motion after the suit was filed  the plaintiff also requested a preliminary injunction against interland s use of its bluehalo mark 
on november  the court denied plaintiff s motion 
in rendering its opinion  the court specifically held that the plaintiff had engaged in so called naked licensing and  as a consequence  had forfeited its rights in the halo trademark 
consequently  interland continues to believe it has meritorious defenses  plans to continue to defend the matter vigorously and believes that no material adverse effect on interland will occur as a result of this litigation 
periodically  the company is made aware that technology it used in its discontinued operations may have infringed on intellectual property rights held by others 
the company has evaluated all such claims and  if necessary and appropriate  sought to obtain licenses for the use of such technology 
if the company or its suppliers were unable to obtain licenses necessary to use intellectual property in its discontinued operation s products or processes  it may be forced to defend legal actions taken against it relating to allegedly protected technology 
the company evaluates all such claims and has accrued a liability and charged discontinued operations for the estimated costs of settlement or adjudication of claims for alleged infringement as of the respective dates of the balance sheets included in this report 
as of august   the company had an aggregate amount of million accrued for such matters 
the company is also a defendant in a number of other lawsuits which the company regards as minor and unlikely to result in any material payment  nonetheless  the outcome of litigation may not be assured  and the company s cash balances could be materially affected by an adverse judgment 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  the company believes it has adequately reserved for the contingencies arising from the above legal matters where an outcome was deemed to be probable and the loss amount could be reasonably estimated 
as such  the company does not believe that the anticipated outcome of the aforementioned proceedings will have a materially adverse impact on its results of operations  its financial condition or its cash flows 
if interland is unable to attract and retain key personnel  it may not be able to compete effectively in its market 
the future success of interland will depend  in part  on its ability to attract and retain key management  technical  and sales and marketing personnel 
the company attempts to enhance its management and technical expertise by 
table of contents recruiting qualified individuals who possess desired skills and experience in certain targeted areas 
the company experiences strong competition for such personnel in the web hosting industry 
the company s inability to retain employees and attract and retain sufficient additional employees  information technology  engineering  and technical support resources could adversely affect its ability to remain competitive in its markets 
the company has and may continue to face the loss of key personnel  which could limit the ability of the company to develop and market its products and services 
interland depends on its reseller sales channel to market and sell many of its services 
interland does not control its resellers  and if it fails to develop or maintain good relations with resellers  it may not achieve the growth in customers and revenues that it expects 
an element of the strategy for the company s growth is to further develop the use of third parties that resell its services 
many of these resellers are web development or web consulting companies that also sell interland s web hosting services  but that generally do not have established customer bases to which they can market these services 
the company is not currently dependent on any one reseller to generate a significant level of business  but it has benefited and continues to significantly benefit from business generated by the reseller channel 
although interland attempts to provide its resellers with incentives such as price discounts on its services that the resellers seek to resell at a profit  the failure of its services to be commercially accepted in some markets  whether as a result of a reseller s performance or otherwise  could cause its current resellers to discontinue their relationships with the company 
interland is vulnerable to system failures  which could harm its reputation  cause its customers to seek reimbursement for services  and cause its customers to seek another provider for services 
the company must be able to operate the systems that manage its network around the clock without interruption 
its operations will depend upon its ability to protect its network infrastructure  equipment and customer files against damage from human error  fire  earthquakes  hurricanes  floods  power loss  telecommunications failures  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
although the company has attempted to build redundancy into its networks  its networks are currently subject to various points of failure 
for example  a problem with one of its routers devices that move information from one computer network to another or switches could cause an interruption in the services the company provides to a portion of its customers 
in the past  the company has experienced periodic interruptions in service 
the company has also experienced  and in the future it may continue to experience  delays or interruptions in service as a result of the accidental or intentional actions of internet users  current and former employees  or others 
any future interruptions could cause customers or end users to seek damages for losses incurred  require the company to replace existing equipment or add redundant facilities  damage the company s reputation for reliable service  cause existing customers to cancel their contracts  or make it more difficult for the company to attract new customers 
interland s data centers and network vulnerability to security breaches could cause disruptions in its service  liability to third parties  or loss of customers 
a significant barrier to electronic commerce and communications is the need for secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
some of the company s services rely on security technology licensed from third parties that provides the encryption and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of confidential information 
despite the design and implementation of a variety of network security measures by the company  unauthorized access  computer viruses  accidental or intentional actions and other disruptions could occur 
in addition  inappropriate use of the network by third parties could also potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information  such as credit card and bank account numbers stored in the company s computer systems 
these security problems could result in the company s liability and could also cause the loss of existing customers and potential customers 

table of contents although the company continues to implement industry standard security measures  third parties may be able to overcome any measures that it implements 
the costs required to eliminate computer viruses and alleviate other security problems could be prohibitively expensive and the efforts to address such problems could result in interruptions  delays or cessation of service to customers  and harm the company s reputation and growth 
concerns over the security of internet transactions and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of the internet  especially as a means of conducting commercial transactions 
disruption of interland s services caused by unknown software or hardware defects could harm its business and reputation 
the company s service offerings depend on complex software and hardware  including proprietary software tools and software licensed from third parties 
complex software and hardware may contain defects  particularly when first introduced or when new versions are released 
the company may not discover software or hardware defects that affect its new or current services or enhancements until after they are deployed 
although interland has not experienced any material software or hardware defects to date  it is possible that defects may exist or occur in the future 
these defects could cause service interruptions  which could damage its reputation or increase its service costs  cause it to lose revenue  delay market acceptance or divert its development resources 
providing services to customers with critical web sites and web based applications could potentially expose interland to lawsuits for customers lost profits or other damages 
because the company s web hosting and applications hosting services are critical to many of its customers businesses  any significant interruption in those services could result in lost profits or other indirect or consequential damages to its customers as well as negative publicity and additional expenditures for it to correct the problem 
although the standard terms and conditions of the company s customer contracts disclaim liability for any such damages  a customer could still bring a lawsuit against it claiming lost profits or other consequential damages as the result of a service interruption or other web site or application problems that the customer may ascribe to it 
a court might not enforce any limitations on its liability  and the outcome of any lawsuit would depend on the specific facts of the case and legal and policy considerations even if the company believes it would have meritorious defenses to any such claims 
in such cases  it could be liable for substantial damage awards 
such damage awards might exceed its liability insurance by unknown but significant amounts  which would seriously harm its business 
interland could face liability for information distributed through its network 
the law relating to the liability of online services companies for information carried on or distributed through their networks is currently unsettled 
online services companies could be subject to claims under both united states and foreign law for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  violation of securities laws or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials distributed through their networks 
several private lawsuits seeking to impose such liability upon other entities are currently pending against other companies 
in addition  organizations and individuals have sent unsolicited commercial e mails from servers hosted by service providers to massive numbers of people  typically to advertise products or services 
this practice  known as spamming  can lead to complaints against service providers that enable such activities  particularly where recipients view the materials received as offensive 
the company may  in the future  receive letters from recipients of information transmitted by its customers objecting to such transmission 
although the company prohibits its customers by contract from spamming  it cannot provide assurances that its customers will not engage in this practice  which could subject it to claims for damages 
in addition  the company may become subject to proposed legislation that would impose liability for or prohibit the transmission over the internet of some types of information 
other countries may also enact legislation or take action that could impose liability on the company or cause it not to be able to operate in those countries 
the imposition upon the company and other online services of potential liability for information carried on or distributed through its systems could require it to implement measures to reduce its exposure to this liability  which may require it to expend substantial resources  or to discontinue service offerings 
the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of these lawsuits and legislative proposals also could affect the rate of growth of internet use 

table of contents interland s business operates in an uncertain legal environment where future government regulation and lawsuits could restrict interland s business or cause unexpected losses 
due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  laws and regulations with respect to the internet may be adopted at federal  state and local levels  covering issues such as user privacy  freedom of expression  pricing  characteristics and quality of products and services  taxation  advertising  intellectual property rights  information security and the convergence of traditional telecommunications services with internet communications 
the company cannot fully predict the nature of future legislation and the manner in which government authorities may interpret and enforce such legislation 
as a result  interland and its customers could be subject to potential liability under future legislation  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the adoption of any such laws or regulations might decrease the growth of the internet which in turn could decrease the demand for the company s services  or increase the cost of doing business 
in addition  applicability to the internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyright and other intellectual property issues  taxation  libel  obscenity and personal privacy is uncertain 
these laws generally pre date the advent of the internet and related technologies and  as a result  do not consider or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
resolving remaining weaknesses in disclosure and internal controls could require more time than anticipated  distract management s attention from interland s ongoing operations  or prove to be more costly than expected 
interland disclosed in its form k for the fiscal year ending august  that it had material weaknesses in its internal and disclosure controls and procedures 
in part iii item of this form k  the company reports significant progress in most areas 
in addition  management believes that its use of alternative mitigating disclosure and reporting processes have been sufficient to provide it with a good faith belief that there are no material inaccuracies or omissions from its most recent sec filings 
however  management recognizes that further improvements in its disclosure and internal controls and procedures are appropriate 
the implementation of these remaining improvements will be time consuming and expensive 
in this regard management is unable to estimate the financial impact of a delay in the implementation of remaining necessary internal and disclosure control improvements  the effects of management s distraction caused by the implementation of the procedural improvements  and  the ongoing cost inefficiencies caused by employment of mitigating controls and procedures necessary to address the remaining existing weaknesses in disclosure and internal controls pending completion of the requisite improvements 
furthermore  uncertainty over these factors and the delay in implementation may cause additional volatility in interland s stock price 
substantial future sales of shares by shareholders could negatively affect interland s stock price 
if the company s shareholders sell substantial amounts of its common stock in the public market  the market price of its common stock could decline 
only a small portion of the company s issued and outstanding shares is subject to any restriction on resale 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of the company s liquid investments and a majority of its debt are at fixed interest rates  and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of august   approximately of the company s liquid investments mature within three months and mature within one year 
the majority of the company s long term debt is comprised of fixed rate capital leases used to finance equipment purchases 
in this regard the underlying debt instruments are not marketable and  therefore  there is no 
table of contents associated market risk 
as of august   management believes the reported amounts of liquid investments and debt to be reasonable approximations of their fair values 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate investment securities will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the portfolio has been primarily comprised of commercial paper rated a p  bank certificates rated aa or better  and corporate medium term notes rated aa or better 
at august   the company s investment portfolio included fixed rate securities with an estimated fair value of million 
the interest rate changes affect the fair market values but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt exclusive of capital leases is also subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of the company s long term debt at august  was million
