revenue recognition casino revenue is the net win from gaming activities  which is the difference between gaming wins and losses 
management and consulting fees are recognized as revenue as services are provided 
the incremental amount of unpaid progressive jackpots is recorded as a liability and a reduction of casino revenue in the period during which the progressive jackpot increases 
promotional allowances reduce revenues in determining net operating revenue 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company s goodwill results from the acquisitions of casino and hotel operations 
effective january  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards board sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses the methods used to capitalize  amortize and to assess impairment of intangible assets  including goodwill resulting from business combinations accounted for under the purchase method 
effective with the adoption of sfas no 
 the company no longer amortizes goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  principally unamortized casino license costs 
in evaluating the company s capitalized casino license cost related to ccal  which comprises principally all of its other intangible assets  management considered all of the criteria set forth in sfas no 
in determining its useful life 
of particular significance in that evaluation was the existing regulatory provision for annual renewal of the license at minimal cost and the current practice of the western cape gambling and racing board board of granting such renewals as long as all applicable laws are complied with as well as compliance with the original conditions of the casino operator license as set forth by the board 
based on that evaluation  the company has deemed the casino license costs to have an indefinite life as of january  included in assets at december  is unamortized goodwill of approximately  and unamortized casino license costs of approximately  in accordance with sfas no 
 the company completed step one of the impairment test on each of the reporting units for which it has recorded goodwill as of january  during the second quarter of the company contracted third party valuation firms to complete the analysis of each reporting unit 
in completing its analysis of the fair value of wmck venture corporation  parent company of womacks casino and hotel  the company used the discounted cash flow dcf method in which the reporting unit is valued by discounting the projected cash flows  to a period in which the annual growth rate is expected to stabilize  to their present value based on a risk adjusted discount rate 
projected cash flows through  are based on historical results  adjusted based on management s conservative projection of future revenue growth given existing market conditions 
a risk adjusted discount rate of  which estimates the return demanded by third party investors  taking into account market risks  and the cost of equity and after tax debt in the optimal hypothetical capital structure  was used in the dcf calculation of wmck venture corp 
in completing its analysis of the fair market value of century casinos caledon pty ltd  the owner of the caledon casino  hotel spa  the company also applied the dcf method and the results were compared to other methods of valuation  most notably the net asset value of caledon in order to further justify the range of values 
cash flows were projected through the end of a risk adjusted rate of  taking into account risk free rates of return  the return demanded by the south african equity market and a risk factor which measures the volatility of caledon relative to the equity markets  was used in the dcf calculation of caledon 
the company also tested for impairment as of january  its previously recognized intangible asset deemed to have an indefinite useful life unamortized casino license costs 
as a result of the analysis  the company has determined that there is no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 
in accordance with the sfas no 
 the company has completed its assessment of the goodwill and other intangibles for impairment at december  and determined that there have been no significant changes in the fair value of the assets  no adverse changes in the projected cash flows or any events or circumstances that would lead management to believe that the fair value of the assets as determined at january  is less than the current carrying value of the reporting units 
the company will continue to assess goodwill and other intangibles for impairment at least annually hereafter 
foreign exchange current period transactions affecting the profit and loss of operations conducted in foreign currencies are valued at the average exchange rate for the period in which they are incurred 
except for equity transactions and balances denominated in us dollars  the balance sheet is re valued based on the exchange rate at the end of the period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk principally related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate some of these risks  we utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge these exposures 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on information available at december  actual results may differ materially 
interest rate sensitivity the company is subject to interest rate risk on the outstanding borrowing under a revolving line of credit facility with wells fargo bank 
interest on the agreement is variable based on the interest rate option selected by the company  whereby the interest on the outstanding debt is subject to fluctuations in the prime interest rate as set by wells fargo  or libor 
in order to minimize the risk of increases in the prime rate or libor the company has entered into two interest rate swap agreements on a total of million notional amount of debt 
in  the company entered into a five year interest rate swap agreement which matures on october  on million notional amount of debt under the rcf  whereby the company pays a libor based fixed rate of and receives a libor based floating rate reset quarterly based on a three month rate 
in may  the company entered into a second five year interest rate swap agreement which matures on july  on million notional amount of debt under the rcf  whereby the company pays a libor based fixed rate of and receives a libor based floating rate reset quarterly based on a three month rate 
generally  the swap arrangement is advantageous to the company to the extent that interest rates increase in the future and disadvantageous to the extent that they decrease 
therefore  by entering into the interest rate swap agreements  we have a cash flow risk when interest rates drop 
for example  for each hypothetical basis points decrease in the three month libor rate below the fixed rate paid by the company less the applicable margin results in an increased use of in cash on an annual basis 
foreign currency exchange risk the majority of our revenue  expense  and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  since a portion of our operations are conducted outside of the us  we enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily the south african rand 
fluctuations in the rand affect the value of the company s investment in the caledon casino  hotel spa 
a hypothetical devaluation of in the dollar vs 
the rand based on the exchange rate as of december  would reduce the value of the company s investment by approximately foreign currency fluctuations also have an impact on reported earnings  primarily those of the company s south african subsidiary 
fluctuations in foreign currency rates did not have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations during the years  and
