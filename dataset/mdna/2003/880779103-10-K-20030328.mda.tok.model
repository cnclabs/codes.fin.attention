critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
changes in the estimates and assumptions used by management could have significant impact on the company s financial results 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company believes that the following are among its most significant accounting polices which are important in determining the reporting of transactions and events and which utilize estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and therefore are based on management judgment 
please refer to note a significant accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a complete listing of the company s accounting policies 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
in valuing inventory  management is required to make assumptions regarding the level of reserves required to value potentially obsolete or over valued items at the lower of cost or market 
the valuation of used equipment taken in trade from customers requires the company to use the best information available to determine the value of the equipment to potential customers 
this value is subject to change based on numerous conditions 
inventory reserves are established taking into account age  frequency of use  or sale  and in the case of repair parts  the installed base of machines 
while calculations are made involving these factors  significant management judgment regarding expectations for future events is involved 
future events which could significantly influence management s judgment and related estimates include general economic conditions in markets where the company s products are sold  new equipment price fluctuations  competitive actions including the introduction of new products and technological advances  as well as new products and design changes introduced by the company 
at december   reserves for excess and obsolete inventory totaled million 
accounts receivable management is required to make judgments relative to the company s ability to collect accounts receivable from the company s customers 
valuation of receivables includes evaluating customer payment histories  customer leverage  availability of third party financing  political and exchange risks and other factors 
many of these factors  including the assessment of a customer s ability to pay  are influenced by economic and market factors which cannot be predicted with certainty 
at december   reserves for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable totaled million 
guarantees the company has issued guarantees of customer financing to purchase equipment as of december  the company must assess the probability of losses or non performance in ways similar to the evaluation of accounts receivable  including consideration of a customer s payment history  leverage  availability of third party finance  political and exchange risks and other factors 
many of these factors  including the assessment of a customer s ability to pay  are influenced by economic and market factors that cannot be predicted with certainty 
to date  losses related to guarantees have been negligible 
customers of the company from time to time may fund the acquisition of the company s equipment through third party finance companies 
in certain instances  the company may provide a credit guarantee to the finance company  by which the company agrees to make payments to the finance company should the customer default 
the maximum liability of the company is limited to the remaining payments due to the finance company at the time of default 
in the event of customer default  the company is generally able to dispose of the equipment with the company realizing the benefits of any net proceeds in excess of the remaining payments due to the finance company 
as of december   the company s maximum exposure to such credit guarantees is million 
total credit guarantees issued by demag and genie as of december  totaled million and million  respectively 
the terms of these guarantees coincide with the financing arranged by the customer and generally does not exceed five years 
given the company s position as the original equipment manufacturer and its knowledge of end markets  the company  when called upon to fulfill a guarantee  generally has been able to liquidate the financed equipment at a minimal loss  if any  to the company 
the company  through its genie subsidiary  issues residual value guarantees under sales type leases 
a residual value guarantee involves a guarantee that a piece of equipment will have a minimum fair market value at a future point in time 
as described in note l net investment in sales type leases in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company s maximum exposure related to residual value guarantees at december  is million 
the company is able to mitigate the risk associated with these guarantees because the maturity of the guarantees is staggered  which limits the amount of used equipment entering the marketplace at any one time 
the company from time to time guarantees that it will buy equipment from its customers in the future at a stated price if certain conditions are met by the customer 
such guarantees are referred to as buyback guarantees 
these conditions generally pertain to the functionality and state of repair of the machine 
as of december   the company s maximum exposure pursuant to buyback guarantees is million 
the company is able to mitigate the risk of these guarantees by staggering the timing of the buybacks and through leveraging its access to the used equipment markets provided by the company s original equipment manufacturer status 
the company recognizes a loss under a guarantee when the company s obligation to make payment under the guarantee is probable and the amount of the loss can be estimated 
a loss would be recognized if the company s payment obligation under the guarantee exceeds the value the company can expect to recover to offset such payment  primarily through the sale of the equipment underlying the guarantee 
revenue recognition revenue and costs are generally recorded when products are shipped and invoiced to either independently owned and operated dealers or to customers 
certain new units may be invoiced prior to the time customers take physical possession 
revenue is recognized in such cases only when the customer has a fixed commitment to purchase the units  the units have been completed  tested and made available to the customer for pickup or delivery  and the customer has requested that the company hold the units for pickup or delivery at a time specified by the customer 
in such cases  the units are invoiced under the company s customary billing terms  title to the units and risks of ownership pass to the customer upon invoicing  the units are segregated from the company s inventory and identified as belonging to the customer and the company has no further obligations under the order 
revenue generated in the united states is recognized when title and risk of loss pass from the company to its customers which occurs upon shipment when terms are fob shipping point which is customary for the company and upon delivery when terms are fob destination 
the company also has a policy requiring it to meet certain criteria in order to recognize revenue  including satisfaction of the following requirements a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  c collectibility is reasonably assured  and d the company has no significant obligations for future performance 
in the united states  the company has the ability to enter into a security agreement and receive a security interest in the product by filing an appropriate uniform commercial code ucc financing statement 
however  a significant portion of the company s revenue is generated outside of the united states 
in many countries outside of the united states  as a matter of statutory law  a seller retains title to a product until payment is made 
the laws do not provide for a seller s retention of a security interest in goods in the same manner as established in the ucc 
in these countries  the company retains title to goods delivered to a customer until the customer makes payment so that the company can recover the goods in the event of customer default on payment 
in these circumstances  where the company only retains title to secure its recovery in the event of customer default  the company also has a policy which requires it to meet certain criteria in order to recognize revenue  including satisfaction of the following requirements a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  d collectibility is reasonably assured  e the company has no significant obligations for future performance  and f the company is not entitled to direct the disposition of the goods  cannot rescind the transaction  cannot prohibit the customer from moving  selling  or otherwise using the goods in the ordinary course of business and has no other rights of holding title that rest with a titleholder of property that is subject to a lien under the ucc 
in circumstances where the sales transaction requires acceptance by the customer for items such as testing on site  installation  trial period or performance criteria  revenue is not recognized unless the following criteria have been met a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  d collectibility is reasonably assured  and e the customer has given their acceptance  the time period for acceptance has elapsed or the company has otherwise objectively demonstrated that the criteria specified in the acceptance provisions have been satisfied 
in addition to performance commitments  the company analyzes factors such as the reason for the purchase to determine if revenue should be recognized 
this analysis is done before the product is shipped and includes the evaluation of factors that may affect the conclusion related to the revenue recognition criteria as follows a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and d collectibility is reasonably assured 
goodwill acquired intangible assets goodwill represents the difference between the total purchase price paid in the acquisition of a business and the fair value of the assets  both tangible and intangible  and liabilities acquired by the company 
acquired intangible assets generally include trade names  technology and customer relationships and are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the company is required annually to review the value of its recorded goodwill and intangible assets to determine if either is potentially impaired 
the initial recognition of intangible assets  as well as the annual review of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets  requires that the company develop estimates of future business performance 
these estimates are used to derive expected cash flow and include assumptions regarding future sales levels  the impact of cost reduction programs  and the level of working capital needed to support a given business 
the company relies on data developed by business segment management as well as macroeconomic data in making these calculations 
the estimate also includes a determination of the company s weighted average cost of capital 
the cost of capital is based on assumptions about interest rates as well as a risk adjusted rate of return required by the company s equity investors 
changes in these estimates can impact the present value of the expected cash flow that is used in determining the fair value of acquired intangible assets as well as the overall expected value of a given business 
impairment of long lived assets the company s policy is to assess its ability to realize on its long lived assets and to evaluate such assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets or group of assets may not be recoverable 
impairment is determined to exist if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows is less than its carrying value 
future cash flow projections include assumptions regarding future sales levels  the impact of cost reduction programs  and the level of working capital needed to support each business 
the company relies on data developed by business segment management as well as macroeconomic data in making these calculations 
there are no assurances that future cash flow assumptions will be achieved 
the amount of any impairment then recognized would be calculated as the difference between estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
accrued warranties the company records accruals for potential warranty claims based on the company s prior claim experience 
warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized 
however  adjustments to the initial warranty accrual are recorded if actual claim experience indicates that adjustments are necessary 
these warranty costs are based upon management s assessment of past claims and current experience 
however  actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated  as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty  including the performance of new products  models and technology  changes in weather conditions for product operation  different uses for products and other similar factors 
accrued product liability the company records accruals for potential product liability claims based on the company s prior claim experience 
accruals for product liability claims are valued based upon the company s prior claims experience  including consideration of the jurisdiction  circumstances of the accident  type of loss or injury  identity of plaintiff  other potential responsible parties  analysis of outside counsel  analysis of internal product liability counsel and the experience of the company s director of product safety 
the company provides self insurance accruals for estimated product liability experience on known claims 
actual product liability costs could be different due to a number of variables such as the decisions of juries or judges 
pension benefits pension benefits represent financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements 
because of the uncertainties involved in estimating the timing and amount of future payments  significant estimates are required to calculate pension expense and liabilities related to the company s plans 
the company utilizes the services of several independent actuaries  whose models are used to facilitate these calculations 
several key assumptions are used in actuarial models to calculate pension expense and liability amounts recorded in the financial statements 
management believes the three most significant variables in the models are expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate  and the expected rate of compensation increase 
the actuarial models also use assumptions for various other factors including employee turnover  retirement age and mortality 
the company s management believes the assumptions used in the actuarial calculations are reasonable and are within accepted practices in each of the respective geographic locations in which the company operates 
the expected long term rates of return on pension plan assets were for us plans and to for international plans at december  these rates are determined annually by management based on a weighted average of current and historical market trends  historical portfolio performance and the portfolio mix of investments 
the discount rates for pension plan liabilities were for u 
s 
plans and to for international plans at december  these rates are used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities and are determined annually by management based on market yields for high quality fixed income investments on the measurement date 
the expected rates of compensation increase for the company s pension plans were for us plans and to for international plans at december  these estimated annual compensation increases are determined by management every year and are based on historical trends and market indices 
income taxes at december  the company had deferred tax assets of million million  net of valuation allowances 
income tax benefit was million for the year ended december  the company estimates income taxes based on diverse and complex regulations that exist in various jurisdictions where it conducts business 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent tax benefits or obligations that arise from temporary timing differences due to differing treatment of certain items for accounting and income tax purposes 
the company evaluates deferred tax assets each period to ensure that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character eg  capital gain versus ordinary income treatment  amount and timing to result in their recovery 
to the extent that the company estimates recovery is not likely  then the company establishes a valuation allowance to reduce the assets to their realizable value 
considerable judgments are required in establishing deferred tax valuation allowances and in assessing possible exposures related to tax matters 
tax returns are subject to audit and local taxing authorities could challenge tax positions 
the company s practice is to review tax filing positions by jurisdiction and to record provisions for probable tax assessments  including interest and penalties  if applicable 
the company believes it records and or discloses such potential tax liabilities as appropriate and has reasonably estimated its income tax liabilities and recoverable tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources net cash of million was provided by operating activities during the year ended december  reduced working capital needs provided approximately million of cash 
the company defines working capital as the sum of accounts receivable and inventory less accounts payable 
net cash used in investing activities was million during the year ended december   primarily related to the acquisitions of genie and demag

acquisitions and new product development have been important components of the company s growth strategy 
although the company may make additional acquisitions in the future  particularly those that would complement the company s existing operations  the company is currently focused on completing the integration of its recent acquisitions 
debt reduction and an improved capital structure are major focal points for the company 
the company regularly reviews its alternatives to improve its capital structure and to reduce debt service through debt refinancings  issuances of equity  asset sales  including strategic dispositions of business units  or any combination thereof 
on april   the company issued approximately million shares of its common stock in a public offering with net proceeds to the company of million 
on july   the company entered into an amended and restated credit facility with its bank lending group 
the revised agreement provides for million of term debt maturing in june and a revolving credit facility of million that is available through june the facility also included provisions for an additional million of term borrowing by the company on terms similar to the current term loan debt under the facility 
on september   the company consummated an incremental term loan borrowing of million under this facility to acquire genie  to refinance some of genie s debt and for other general corporate purposes 
in addition to providing the company with additional funds  the revised credit agreement also amended certain covenants and other provisions to allow the company greater flexibility 
this added flexibility included changes to increase the company s ability to make acquisitions  participate in joint ventures and take other corporate actions 
adjustments were also made to financial covenant ratios  including the company s consolidated total leverage ratio  consolidated interest coverage ratio and consolidated senior leverage ratio  that permit the company to maintain additional debt for a longer period of time

the company s businesses are working capital intensive and require funding for purchases of production and replacement parts inventories  capital expenditures for repair  replacement and upgrading of existing facilities  as well as trade financing for receivables from customers and dealers 
the company has significant debt service requirements  including semi annual interest payments on its senior subordinated notes and monthly interest payments on its bank credit facilities 
other than default under the terms of the company s debt instruments  there are no other events that would accelerate the repayment of the company s debt 
in the event of default  these borrowings could become payable on demand 
management believes that cash generated from operations  together with the company s bank credit facilities and cash on hand  provides the company with adequate liquidity to meet the company s operating and debt service requirements 
the company s main sources of funding are cash generated from operations and access to the company s bank credit facilities  as well as the company s ability to access the capital markets 
additionally  the company sells customer accounts receivable  substantially all of which are insured  to third party institutions to accelerate the collection of cash 
cash generated from operations is directly tied to the company s sales 
a decrease in sales will have a negative impact on the company s ability to derive liquidity from its operations 
sales are subject to decline for a number of reasons  including economic conditions  weather  competition and foreign currency fluctuations 
a significant portion of sales are financed by third party finance companies in reliance on the credit worthiness of the company s customers and the estimated residual value of its equipment 
deterioration in the credit quality of the company s customers or the estimated residual value of its equipment could negatively impact the ability of such customers to obtain the resources needed to make purchases from the company and could have a material adverse impact on results of operations or financial condition of the company 
the recent economic climate has had a negative effect on cash generated from operations  as consumer confidence remains fragile  many of the company s customers have delayed purchasing decisions and the availability of third party financing has become more limited 
the company s ability to borrow under its existing bank credit facilities is subject to the company s ability to comply with a number of covenants 
the company s bank credit facilities include covenants that require the company to meet certain financial tests  including a pro forma consolidated leverage ratio test  a consolidated interest ratio test  a consolidated fixed charge ratio test  a pro forma consolidated senior secured debt leverage ratio test and a capital expenditures test 
these covenants require quarterly compliance and become more restrictive annually 
maintaining compliance with these ratios depends on the future performance of the company and the achievement of cost savings and earning levels anticipated in acquisitions 
the company is currently in compliance with its financial covenants under its bank credit facilities 
the company s ability to remain compliant with its covenants in the future is dependent on its ability to maintain its earnings  including its ability to generate cash flow from working capital reductions  realize cost savings at recently acquired units  realize the benefit of its restructuring programs and maintain an appropriate level of operating profits 
the interest rates charged are subject to adjustment based on the company s consolidated leverage ratio 
the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding portion of the revolving credit component of the company s bank credit facility was at december  the company s ability to access the capital markets to raise funds  through the sale of equity or debt securities  is subject to various factors  some specific to the company and some impacted by general economic and or financial market conditions

however  the company does not believe that these contingencies and uncertainties will  in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on the company 
when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and possible to make reasonable estimates of the company s liability with respect to such matters  a provision is recorded for the amount of such estimate or for the minimum amount of a range of estimates when it is not possible to estimate the amount within the range that is most likely to occur
