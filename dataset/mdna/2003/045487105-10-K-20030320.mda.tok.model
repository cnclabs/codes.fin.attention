item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is management s analysis to assist in the understanding and evaluation of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of associated banc corp the parent company  together with all its subsidiaries the corporation 
it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report 
during the second quarter of  the parent company merged its minnesota bank subsidiaries associated bank minnesota  signal bank national association  and signal bank south national association into a single national banking charter under the name associated bank minnesota  national association 
during  the corporation merged its wisconsin bank subsidiaries associated bank south central  associated bank north  associated bank milwaukee  associated bank  national association  associated bank lakeshore  national association  and associated bank green bay  national association into a single national banking charter  headquartered in green bay  wisconsin  under the name associated bank  national association 
certain nonbank subsidiaries associated leasing  inc  associated banc corp services  inc  and associated commercial mortgage  inc 
also merged with and into the resultant bank  becoming operating divisions of associated bank  national association 
the financial discussion that follows may refer to the effect of the corporation s business combination activity  detailed under section  business combinations  and note  business combination  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the detailed financial discussion focuses on results compared to discussion of results compared to is predominantly in section compared to critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and revenues and expenses for the period 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the determination of the allowance for loan losses  mortgage servicing rights  derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  and income taxes 
the consolidated financial statements of the corporation are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates 
this preparation requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  actual results could differ from the estimates  assumptions  and judgments reflected in the financial statements 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and  as such  have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
management believes the following policies are both important to the portrayal of the corporation s financial condition and results and require subjective or complex judgments and  therefore  management considers the following to be critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses subject to the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments is management s evaluation process used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses which combines several factors management s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio  consideration of past loan loss experience  trends in past due and nonperforming loans  risk characteristics of the various classifications of loans  existing economic conditions  the fair value of underlying collateral  and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect probable credit losses 
because current economic conditions can change and future events are inherently difficult to predict  the anticipated amount of estimated loan losses  and therefore the adequacy of the allowance  could change significantly 
as an integral part of their examination process  various regulatory agencies also review the allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require that certain loan balances be charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management  based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
the corporation believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate and properly recorded in the financial statements 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  loans  of the notes to consolidated financial statements and section allowance for loan losses 
mortgage servicing rights valuation the fair value of the corporation s mortgage servicing rights asset is important to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements in that mortgage servicing rights are subject to a fair value based impairment standard 
mortgage servicing rights do not trade in an active open market with readily observable prices 
as such  like other participants in the mortgage banking business  the corporation relies on an internal discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights 
while the corporation believes that the values produced by its internal model are indicative of the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights portfolio  these values can change significantly depending upon the then current interest rate environment  estimated prepayment speeds of the underlying mortgages serviced  and other economic conditions 
the proceeds that might be received should the corporation actually consider a sale of the mortgage servicing rights portfolio could differ from the amounts reported at any point in time 
the corporation believes the mortgage servicing rights asset is properly recorded in the financial statements 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  goodwill and other intangible assets  of the notes to consolidated financial statements and section noninterest expense 
derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting in various aspects of its business  the corporation uses derivative financial instruments to modify exposures to changes in interest rates and market prices for other financial instruments 
substantially all of these derivative financial instruments are designated as hedges for financial reporting purposes 
the application of the hedge accounting policy requires judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness  identification of similar hedged item groupings  and measurement of changes in the fair value of hedged items 
however  if in the future the derivative financial instruments used by the corporation no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment and  consequently  the change in the fair value of hedged items could be recognized in earnings  the impact on the consolidated results of operations and reported earnings could be significant 
the corporation believes hedge effectiveness is evaluated properly in the consolidated financial statements 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  derivative and hedging activities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income tax accounting the assessment of tax liabilities involves the use of estimates  assumptions  interpretations  and judgments concerning certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax codes 
there can be no assurance that future events  such as court decisions or positions of federal and state taxing authorities  will not differ from management s current assessment  the impact of which could be significant to the consolidated results of operations and reported earnings 
the corporation believes the tax liabilities are adequate and properly recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  income taxes  and section income taxes 
segment review as described in note  segment reporting  the corporation s primary reportable segment is banking  conducted through its bank and lending subsidiaries 
banking includes a community banking lending and deposit gathering to businesses including business related services such as cash management and international banking services and to consumers including mortgages and credit cards  and b corporate banking specialized lending such as commercial real estate  lease financing  and banking to larger businesses and metro or niche markets  and the support to deliver banking services 
the corporation s profitability is primarily dependent on net interest income  noninterest income  the level of the provision for loan losses  noninterest expense  and taxes of its banking segment 
the consolidated discussion is therefore predominantly describing the banking segment results 
performance summary the corporation recorded net income of million for the year ended december   an increase of million or over the million earned in basic earnings per share for were  a increase over basic earnings per share of 
earnings per diluted share were  a increase over diluted earnings per share of 
with the required adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas and sfas  which eliminated the amortization of goodwill effective january   basic earnings per share of in represented a increase over and diluted earnings per share of in were higher than as presented in table

the increase in taxable equivalent net interest income was due to changes in interest rates adding million and increased volume of earning assets and liabilities  together with changes in product mix adding million 
average earning assets increased billion to billion  including the impact of the acquisition of signal financial corporation signal on february  see section business combinations 
net interest income and net interest margin were impacted in by the low interest rate environment  competitive pricing pressures  higher earning asset balances  and funding strategies to take advantage of lower interest rates

to take advantage of the lower rate environment  the corporation increased long term debt by million and issued million of company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities 
asset quality was affected by the impact of challenging economic conditions on customers 
the provision for loan losses increased to million compared to million in net charge offs were million  an increase of million over  due primarily to the charge off of several commercial credits 
net charge offs were of average loans compared to in the ratio of allowance for loan losses to loans was and at december  and  respectively 
nonperforming loans were million  representing of total loans at year end  compared to million or of total loans last year 
noninterest income was million for  million or higher than  led by strong results in mortgage banking and service charge revenue 
mortgage banking revenue increased by million driven by strong secondary mortgage production  while service charges on deposit accounts were up million over noninterest expense was million  up million or over adjusting for goodwill amortization  as described above  noninterest expense was million or higher in  due principally to the corporation s larger operating base and increases in mortgage servicing rights expense 
personnel expense rose million or  reflecting the expanded employee base  as well as higher base salaries and fringe benefit costs 
mortgage servicing rights expense increased million  a function of increases to both the valuation allowance and higher amortization of the mortgage servicing rights asset 
income tax expense increased to million  up million from the increase was primarily attributable to higher net income before tax 
the effective tax rate in was compared to for business combinations on february   the corporation consummated its acquisition of of the outstanding common shares of signal  a financial holding company headquartered in mendota heights  minnesota 
signal operated banking branches in nine locations in the twin cities and eastern minnesota 
as a result of the acquisition  the corporation expanded its minnesota presence  particularly in the twin cities area 
the signal transaction was consummated through the issuance of approximately million shares of common stock and million in cash for a purchase price of million 
the value of the shares was determined using the closing stock price of the corporation s stock on september   the initiation date of the transaction 
there were no business combinations during or the corporation s business combination activity is further summarized in note  business combination  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income statement analysis net interest income net interest income is the primary source of the corporation s revenue 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense on interest bearing deposits and other borrowings  used to fund interest earning and other assets or activities 
the amount of net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and by the amount and composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
additionally  net interest income is impacted by the sensitivity of the balance sheet to changes in interest rates which factors in characteristics such as the fixed or variable nature of the financial instruments  contractual maturities  and repricing frequencies 
net interest income in the consolidated statements of income which excludes the taxable equivalent adjustment was million  compared to million last year 
the taxable equivalent adjustments the adjustments to bring tax exempt interest to a level that would yield the same after tax income had that income been subject to taxation using a tax rate of million for and million for resulted in fully taxable equivalent net interest income of million and million  respectively 
taxable equivalent net interest income was million for  an increase of million or from the increase in taxable equivalent net interest income was attributable to both lower interest rates  particularly on the cost of interest bearing liabilities  and a higher level of earning assets 
the net interest margin for was  compared to in the bp increase in net interest margin is attributable to the net of a bp increase in interest rate spread the net of a bp lower cost of interest bearing liabilities offset by a bp decrease in the yield on earning assets  and a bp lower contribution from net free funds 
interest rates were generally stable and low during  but were higher and steadily falling during comparatively  the federal funds rate at december   was bp lower than at december   while the average federal funds rate for was bp lower than for interest rate spread and net interest margin are utilized to measure and explain changes in net interest income 
interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid for interest bearing liabilities that fund those assets 
the net interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to average earning assets 
the net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread because noninterest bearing sources of funds net free funds  principally demand deposits and stockholders equity  also support earning assets 
to compare tax exempt asset yields to taxable yields  the yield on tax exempt loans and securities is computed on a taxable equivalent basis 
net interest income  interest rate spread  and net interest margin are discussed on a taxable equivalent basis 
table provides average balances of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the associated interest income and expense  and the corresponding interest rates earned and paid  as well as net interest income  interest rate spread  and net interest margin on a taxable equivalent basis for the three years ended december  tables through present additional information to facilitate the review and discussion of taxable equivalent net interest income  interest rate spread  and net interest margin 
as shown in the rate volume analysis in table  changes in the rates resulted in a million increase to taxable equivalent net interest income  while increases in volume and changes in the mix of both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities added million  for a combined increase of million 
rate changes on interest bearing liabilities lowered interest expense by million  while the changes in rates on earning assets reduced interest income by million  for a net favorable impact of million 
for  the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased bp to  aided by the low rate environment 
the combined average cost of interest bearing deposits was  down bp  with the most significant rate decreases seen in deposit categories with the highest balances  namely money market accounts down bp to and non brokered time deposits down bp to 
the cost of wholesale funds comprised of all short term borrowings and long term funding decreased bp to for  with the corporation implementing a number of funding strategies to take advantage of the low interest rate environment 
the interest bearing liability rate changes resulted in million lower interest expense  with million attributable to interest bearing deposits and million due to wholesale funding 
for  the yield on earning assets fell bp to  driven primarily by a bp decline in the loan yield 
the average loan yield was 
the lower rate environment for new originations  competitive pricing pressure and refinancing in many loan categories put downward pressure on loan yields in the yield on securities and short term investments combined was down bp to 
the earning asset rate changes reduced interest income by million  a combination of million lower interest on loans and million lower interest on securities and short term investments combined 
from a volume perspective  the growth and composition change of earning assets contributed an additional million to taxable equivalent net interest income  while the growth and composition of interest bearing liabilities cost an additional million  netting a million increase to taxable equivalent net interest income 
average earning assets were billion in  an increase of billion  or  from  including the impact of the signal acquisition on february  loans accounted for the majority of the growth in earning assets  increasing by million  or  to billion on average in and representing of average earning assets compared to for for  taxable equivalent interest income on loans increased million from growth  but decreased million from the impact of the rate environment as noted above  for a net decrease of million versus last year see table 
securities and short term investments combined increased million on average 
taxable equivalent interest income on securities and short term investments for increased million from volume changes  but decreased million from the impact of the rate environment  for a net million decrease to taxable equivalent interest income 
average interest bearing liabilities were billion in  an increase of million  or  from the growth in earning assets was also supported by a million  or  increase in average noninterest bearing deposits a component of net free funds 
the growth in interest bearing liabilities came from increases in wholesale funding sources  as average interest bearing deposits were level in compared to average wholesale funding sources increased by million  representing of average interest bearing liabilities for  versus last year 
furthermore  to take advantage of the lower rate environment  the corporation shifted funds from short term borrowing sources to long term funding  increasing its long term funding by billion to of average interest bearing liabilities compared to for 
therefore  for  interest expense on wholesale funding increased by million due to volume changes the net of a million increase from additional average long term funding offset by a million decrease of short term borrowings and decreased by million from lower rates 
with no volume change in total interest bearing deposits  the million reduction in interest expense on those deposits was attributable to the favorable impact of the lower rate environment

the change was predominantly the result of decreases in servicing fees on personal and employee benefit plans due to the lower average market value of assets under management  reflecting market conditions  offset partly by fee increases for other trust services 
the market value of assets under management was billion at december  compared to billion at december  service charges on deposit accounts were million  million higher than  due in part to higher volumes associated with a larger account base 
the increase was a function of lower earnings credit rates  higher service charges on business accounts  higher fees on overdrafts nonsufficient funds  and an increase in service charge fees during the first quarter of mortgage banking income consists of servicing fees  the gain or loss on sales of mortgage loans to the secondary market  gains on sales of servicing  and production related fees origination  underwriting  and escrow waiver fees

while the strong mortgage refinance activity benefited mortgage banking income  it increased the prepayment speeds of the corporation s mortgage portfolio serviced for others  a key factor behind the valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the corporation s accounting policy for mortgage servicing rights and section critical accounting policies 
a valuation allowance is established to the extent the carrying value of the mortgage servicing rights exceeds the estimated fair value

loans of this type are in a diverse range of industries 
the credit risk related to commercial loans is largely influenced by general economic conditions and the resulting impact on a borrower s operations 
within the commercial  financial  and agricultural classification  loans to finance agricultural production totaled only of total loans at december   compared to at december  real estate construction loans grew million or to million  representing of the total loan portfolio at the end of  compared to million or at the end of loans in this classification are primarily short term interim loans that provide financing for the acquisition or development of commercial real estate  such as multifamily or other commercial development projects 
real estate construction loans are made to developers and project managers who are well known to the corporation  have prior successful project experience  and are well capitalized 
projects undertaken by these developers are carefully reviewed by the corporation to ensure that they are economically viable 
loans of this type are primarily made to customers based in the corporation s tri state market in which the corporation has a thorough knowledge of the local market economy 
the credit risk associated with real estate construction loans is generally confined to specific geographic areas  but is also influenced by general economic conditions 
the corporation controls the credit risk on these types of loans by making loans in familiar markets to developers  underwriting the loans to meet the requirements of institutional investors in the secondary market  reviewing the merits of individual projects  controlling loan structure  and monitoring project progress and construction advances 
commercial real estate includes loans secured by farmland  multifamily properties  and nonfarm nonresidential real estate properties 
commercial real estate totaled billion at december   up million or over last year and comprised of total loans outstanding versus at year end commercial real estate loans involve borrower characteristics similar to those discussed above for commercial loans and real estate construction projects 
loans of this type are mainly for business and industrial properties  multifamily properties  and community purpose properties 
loans are primarily made to customers based in wisconsin  illinois  and minnesota 
credit risk is managed in a similar manner to commercial loans and real estate construction by employing sound underwriting guidelines  lending to borrowers in local markets and businesses  and formally reviewing the borrower s financial soundness and relationship on an ongoing basis 
in many cases the corporation will take additional real estate collateral to further secure the overall lending relationship 
residential real estate loans totaled billion at the end of  up million or from the prior year and comprised of total loans outstanding versus at year end loans in this classification include residential mortgage which consists of conventional home mortgages and second mortgages and home equity lines 
residential mortgage loans generally limit the maximum loan to of collateral value 
residential mortgage loans were billion at december   down million or compared to last year  principally due to high refinance activity prompted by lower interest rates and the subsequent sale of newer  fixed rate loan production into the secondary market 
home equity lines grew by million  or  to million in  an attractive product to consumers given the lower rate environment in consumer loans to individuals totaled million at december   up million or compared to  representing of the year end loan portfolio 
consumer loans include short term installment loans  direct and indirect automobile loans  recreational vehicle loans  credit card loans which are primarily business oriented  student loans  and other personal loans 
individual borrowers may be required to provide related collateral or a satisfactory endorsement or guaranty from another person  depending on the specific type of loan and the creditworthiness of the borrower 
credit risk for these types of loans is generally greatly influenced by general economic conditions  the characteristics of individual borrowers  and the nature of the loan collateral 
credit risk is primarily controlled by reviewing the creditworthiness of the borrowers as well as taking appropriate collateral and guaranty positions on such loans 
factors that are critical to managing overall credit quality are sound loan underwriting and administration  systematic monitoring of existing loans and commitments  effective loan review on an ongoing basis  early identification of potential problems  an adequate allowance for loan losses  and sound nonaccrual and charge off policies 
an active credit risk management process is used for commercial loans to further ensure that sound and consistent credit decisions are made 
credit risk is controlled by detailed underwriting procedures  comprehensive loan administration  and periodic review of borrowers outstanding loans and commitments 
borrower relationships are formally reviewed on an ongoing basis for early identification of potential problems 
further analyses by customer  industry  and geographic location are performed to monitor trends  financial performance  and concentrations 
the loan portfolio is widely diversified by types of borrowers  industry groups  and market areas within our primary three state area 
significant loan concentrations are considered to exist for a financial institution when there are amounts loaned to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions

allowance for loan losses the loan portfolio is the primary asset subject to credit risk 
credit risk is controlled and monitored through the use of lending standards  a thorough review of potential borrowers  and on going review of loan payment performance 
active asset quality administration  including early problem loan identification and timely resolution of problems  further ensures appropriate management of credit risk and minimization of loan losses 
credit risk management for each loan type is discussed briefly in the section entitled loans 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of an amount adequate to provide for probable credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on management s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio  consideration of past loan loss experience  trends in past due and nonperforming loans  risk characteristics of the various classifications of loans  existing economic conditions  the fair value of underlying collateral  and other factors which could affect probable credit losses 
assessing these numerous factors involves significant judgment 
management considers the allowance for loan losses a critical accounting policy see section critical accounting policies 
see management s allowance for loan losses accounting policy in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements and note  loans  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for certain additional allowance for loan losses disclosures 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  compared to million at december  the million increase was the net result of a million provision for loan losses and million acquired with the signal acquisition offset by million of net charge offs 
the provision for loan losses in was million 
in comparison  the provision for loan losses for was million and million in the provision for loan losses is predominantly a function of the result of the methodology and other qualitative and quantitative factors used to determine the allowance for loan losses

the change in the allowance for loan losses is a function of a number of factors  including but not limited to changes in the loan portfolio see table  net charge offs see table  and nonperforming loans see table 
first  total loan growth from year end to was billion or 
the acquisition of signal included million of allowance for loan losses on million of loans 
loan growth during was strongest in the commercial loan portfolio defined as commercial real estate  commercial  financial  and agricultural loans  real estate construction loans  and lease financing  which grew to represent of total loans at year end compared to last year end 
this segment of the loan portfolio carries greater inherent credit risk described under section loans 
net charge offs for increased to million  with million of the total million increase in commercial loan charge offs 
finally  nonperforming loans to total loans grew to for compared to last year 
the allocation of the corporation s allowance for loan losses for the last five years is shown in table the allocation methodology applied by the corporation  designed to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  focuses on changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio  changes in levels of impaired and other nonperforming loans  the risk inherent in specific loans  concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries  existing economic conditions  and historical losses on each portfolio category 
because each of the criteria used is subject to change  the allocation of the allowance for loan losses is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future loan losses in any particular loan category 
the total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio 
management continues to target and maintain the allowance for loan losses equal to the allocation methodology plus an unallocated portion  as determined by economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors affecting the corporation s borrowers 
management allocates the allowance for loan losses for credit losses by pools of risk 
the commercial loan commercial  financial  and agricultural  real estate construction  commercial real estate  and lease financing allocations are based on a quarterly review of individual loans  loan types  and industries 
the retail loan residential mortgage  home equity  and consumer allocation is based on analysis of historical delinquency and charge off statistics and trends 
minimum loss factors used by the corporation for criticized loan categories are consistent with regulatory agency factors 
loss factors for non criticized loan categories are based primarily on loan type  historical loan loss experience  and industry statistics 
the mechanism used to address differences between estimated and actual loan loss experience includes review of recent nonperforming loan trends  underwriting trends  external factors  and management s judgment relating to current assumptions 
the allocation methods used for december  and were comparable 
factors used for criticized loans defined as specific loans warranting either specific allocation or a criticized status of watch  special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss  as well as for non criticized loan categories  were unchanged between the years 
at both december  and  current economic conditions carried various uncertainties requiring management s judgment as to the possible impact on the business results of numerous individual borrowers and certain industries 
additionally  the pace at which the financial results of a borrower s company can take a downturn from challenging and varied economic conditions continued to be a factor for both years 
thus  at year end  of the allowance compared to at year end was allocated to criticized loans  including million of allowance identified for a million commercial manufacturing credit for which management has doubts concerning the future collectibility of the loan given current economic conditions 
while the payments for this credit have been current during  the credit was added to nonaccrual loans during second quarter the primary shift in the allowance allocation was the amount allocated to commercial  financial  and agricultural loans at year end which was million  representing compared to at year end of the allowance for loan losses 
a greater amount of these loans are in criticized categories versus at year end  charge offs of this loan type have increased to million for  up between the years  these loans represent of nonperforming loans compared to last year end  and commercial  financial  and agricultural loans grew to represent of total loans at december  compared to at year end 
as noted under the section loans  the credit risk of this loan category is largely influenced by the impact on borrowers of general economic conditions  which have been noted to be challenging and uncertain 
the allowance allocated to commercial real estate was at year end  down from at year end in for this category  a greater amount of these loans were in criticized loan categories  which materialized into greater charge offs during see table 
while commercial real estate loans grew since year end  they represented of total loans at december   relatively unchanged from last year 
for december  and  the allocation methods were also generally comparable 
however  certain economic indicators were less favorable at year end versus  such as the greater uncertainty of current economic conditions  the terrorist attacks in september  and the increased pace of financial downturn for various businesses 
therefore  the allocations for criticized loans in substandard and watch categories were increased at year end compared to the amount allocated to commercial  financial  and agricultural loans in was million  representing of the allowance for loan losses  compared to last year 
in for this category  a greater amount of these loans were in criticized loan categories and for which specific allocations were made 
thus  as anticipated  table evidences that this category incurred the largest amount of charge offs 
finally  commercial  financial  and agricultural loans represented of nonperforming loans compared to last year 
for  the amount allocated for commercial real estate increased to million  representing of the allowance for loan losses compared to last year 
the increase was a function of changes in the commercial real estate loan category  including increased loan balances  growing to represent of total loans versus at year end  and increased net charge off activity of million for  versus last year of million 
management carefully considers numerous detailed and general factors  its assumptions  and the likelihood of materially different conditions that could alter its assumptions 
consolidated net income could be affected if management s estimate of the allowance for loan losses are materially different  requiring additional provision for loan losses to be recorded 
management believes the allowance for loan losses to be adequate at december  while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and the impact of such change on the corporation s borrowers 
as an integral part of their examination process  various regulatory agencies also review the allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require that certain loan balances be charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management  based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
management expects improvement in credit quality should the economy improve in nonperforming loans  potential problem loans  and other real estate owned management is committed to an aggressive nonaccrual and problem loan identification philosophy 
this philosophy is implemented through the ongoing monitoring and review of all pools of risk in the loan portfolio to ensure that problem loans are identified quickly and the risk of loss is minimized 
nonperforming loans are defined as nonaccrual loans  loans days or more past due but still accruing  and restructured loans 
the corporation specifically excludes from its definition of nonperforming loans student loan balances that are days or more past due and still accruing and that have contractual government guarantees as to collection of principal and interest 
such past due student loans were approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments 
additionally  whenever management becomes aware of facts or circumstances that may adversely impact the collectibility of principal or interest on loans  it is management s practice to place such loans on nonaccrual status immediately  rather than delaying such action until the loans become days past due 
previously accrued and uncollected interest on such loans is reversed  amortization of related loan fees is suspended  and income is recorded only to the extent that interest payments are subsequently received in cash and a determination has been made that the principal balance of the loan is collectible 
if collectibility of the principal is in doubt  payments received are applied to loan principal 
loans past due days or more but still accruing interest are also included in nonperforming loans 
loans past due days or more but still accruing are classified as such where the underlying loans are both well secured the collateral value is sufficient to cover principal and accrued interest and are in the process of collection 
also included in nonperforming loans are restructured loans 
restructured loans involve the granting of some concession to the borrower involving the modification of terms of the loan  such as changes in payment schedule or interest rate 
table nonperforming loans and other real estate owned december  in thousands nonaccrual loans      accruing loans past due days or more      restructured loans  total nonperforming loans      other real estate owned      total nonperforming assets      ratios at year end nonperforming loans to total loans nonperforming assets to total assets allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans nonperforming loans at december   were million with signal adding approximately million at acquisition  compared to million at december   and million at year end the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans at the end of was  as compared to and at december  and  respectively 
nonaccrual loans accounted for the majority of the increase in nonperforming loans since year end nonaccrual loans increased million  restructured loans increased million  and accruing loans past due days or more increased million 
commercial nonaccrual loans representing approximately of nonaccrual loans at year end versus at year end increased million 
the increase in commercial nonaccrual loans from year end to year end is predominantly attributable to the addition of one commercial manufacturing credit totaling million for which payments are current  however  the corporation has doubts concerning the future collectibility of the loan given the current economic conditions and has set aside million of the allowance for loan losses for this credit 
the remaining rise in nonaccrual loans is primarily attributable to the commercial loan portfolio and is not concentrated within the same industry 
the corporation s allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was at year end  down from at year end and at year end other real estate owned increased to million at december   compared to million and million at year end and  respectively  predominantly due to the addition of an million commercial real estate property during net gains on sales of other real estate owned were   and  for   and  respectively 
management actively seeks to ensure properties held are monitored to minimize the corporation s risk of loss 
the following table shows  for those loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis and restructured loans for the years ended as indicated  the gross interest that would have been recorded if the loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and the amount of interest income that was included in interest income for the period 
table foregone loan interest years ended december  in thousands interest income in accordance with original terms    interest income recognized    reduction in interest income    potential problem loans are loans where there are doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms 
the decision of management to place loans in this category does not necessarily indicate that the corporation expects losses to occur  but that management recognizes that a higher degree of risk is associated with these performing loans 
at december   potential problem loans totaled million  compared to million at december  the loans that have been reported as potential problem loans are not concentrated in a particular industry  but rather cover a diverse range of businesses 
management does not presently expect significant losses from credits in the potential problem loan category 
investment securities portfolio the investment securities portfolio is intended to provide the corporation with adequate liquidity  flexibility in asset liability management  a source of stable income  and is structured with minimum credit exposure to the corporation 
investment securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair market value in the consolidated balance sheet while investment securities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost 
at december   the total carrying value of investment securities represented of total assets  compared to at year end on average  the investment portfolio represented and of average earning assets for and  respectively 
the classification of securities as held to maturity or available for sale is determined at the time of purchase 
the corporation classifies most investment purchases as available for sale 
this is consistent with the corporation s investment philosophy of maintaining flexibility to manage the investment portfolio  particularly in light of asset liability management strategies  including possible securities sales in response to changes in interest rates or prepayment risk  the need to manage regulatory capital  and other factors

deposits deposits are the corporation s largest source of funds 
competition is especially strong for deposits  with the corporation competing with other bank and nonbank institutions  as well as with investment alternatives such as money market or other mutual funds and brokerage houses 
the corporation s nonbrokered deposit growth has been impacted by competitive factors  as well as other investment opportunities available to customers

funds are available from a number of sources  primarily from the core deposit base and from loans and securities repayments and maturities 
additionally  liquidity is provided from sales of the securities portfolio  lines of credit with major banks  the ability to acquire large and brokered deposits  and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale 
the corporation s liquidity management framework includes measurement of several key elements  such as wholesale funding as a percent of total assets and liquid assets to short term wholesale funding 
the corporation s liquidity framework also incorporates contingency planning to assess the nature and volatility of funding sources and to determine alternatives to these sources 
the contingency plan would be activated to ensure the corporation s funding commitments could be met in the event of general market disruption or adverse economic conditions 
strong capital ratios  credit quality  and core earnings are essential to retaining high credit ratings and  consequently  cost effective access to the wholesale funding markets 
a downgrade or loss in credit ratings could have an impact on the corporation s ability to access wholesale funding at favorable interest rates 
as a result  capital ratios  asset quality measurements  and profitability ratios are monitored on an ongoing basis as part of the liquidity management process

the parent company manages its liquidity position to provide the funds necessary to pay dividends to shareholders  service debt  invest in subsidiaries  repurchase common stock  and satisfy other operating requirements 
the parent company s primary funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements are dividends and service fees from subsidiaries  borrowings with major banks  commercial paper issuance  and proceeds from the issuance of equity 
dividends received in cash from subsidiaries totaled million in and represent a primary funding source 
at december   million in dividends could be paid to the parent by its subsidiaries without obtaining prior regulatory approval  subject to the capital needs of the banks 
as discussed in item  the subsidiary banks are subject to regulation and  among other things  may be limited in their ability to pay dividends or transfer funds to the parent company 
accordingly  consolidated cash flows as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows may not represent cash immediately available for the payment of cash dividends to the corporation s shareholders or for other cash needs 
in addition to subsidiary dividends  the parent company has multiple funding sources that could be used to increase liquidity and provide additional financial flexibility 
these sources include a revolving credit facility  commercial paper  and two shelf registrations to issue debt and preferred securities or a combination thereof 
the parent company has available a million revolving credit facility with established lines of credit from nonaffiliated banks  of which million was available at december  in addition  million of commercial paper was available at december   under the parent company s commercial paper program

quantitative and qualitative december disclosures about market risk market risk arises from exposure to changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  and other relevant market rate or price risk 
the corporation faces market risk in the form of interest rate risk through other than trading activities 
market risk from other than trading activities in the form of interest rate risk is measured and managed through a number of methods 
the corporation uses financial modeling techniques that measure the sensitivity of future earnings due to changing rate environments to measure interest rate risk 
policies established by the corporation s asset liability committee and approved by the corporation s board of directors limit exposure of earnings at risk 
general interest rate movements are used to develop sensitivity as the corporation feels it has no primary exposure to a specific point on the yield curve 
these limits are based on the corporation s exposure to a bp and bp immediate and sustained parallel rate move  either upward or downward 
interest rate risk in order to measure earnings sensitivity to changing rates  the corporation uses three different measurement tools static gap analysis  simulation of earnings  and economic value of equity 
the static gap analysis starts with contractual repricing information for assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet instruments 
these items are then combined with repricing estimations for administered rate interest bearing demand deposits  savings  and money market accounts and non rate related products demand deposit accounts  other assets  and other liabilities to create a baseline repricing balance sheet 
in addition to the contractual information  residential mortgage whole loan products and mortgage backed securities are adjusted based on industry estimates of prepayment speeds that capture the expected prepayment of principal above the contractual amount based on how far away the contractual coupon is from market coupon rates 
the following table represents the corporation s consolidated static gap position as of december  table interest rate sensitivity analysis december  interest sensitivity period total within over days days days year year total in thousands earning assets loans  held for sale    investment securities  at fair       value loans       interest rate swaps    other earning assets    total earning assets       interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits       other interest bearing liabilities       interest rate swaps    total interest bearing liabilities       interest sensitivity gap       cumulative interest sensitivity gap    month cumulative gap as a percentage of earning assets at december  the interest rate sensitivity assumptions for demand deposits  savings accounts  money market accounts  and interest bearing demand deposit accounts are based on current and historical experiences regarding portfolio retention and interest rate repricing behavior 
based on these experiences  a portion of these balances are considered to be long term and fairly stable and are therefore included in the over year category 
for analysis purposes  brokered cds of million have been included with other interest bearing liabilities and excluded from interest bearing deposits 
interest rate swaps on funding are presented on a net basis 
the static gap analysis in table provides a representation of the corporation s earnings sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
it is a static indicator that does not reflect various repricing characteristics and may not necessarily indicate the sensitivity of net interest income in a changing interest rate environment 
at the end of  the corporation s balance sheet was relatively neutral to interest rate movements 
during  a number of initiatives were executed and the balance sheet mix changed which positioned the corporation to be more asset sensitive 
asset sensitive means that assets will reprice faster than liabilities 
in a rising rate environment  an asset sensitive bank will generally benefit 
these changes included issuing long term funding  growth in demand deposits  and shortening of the mortgage portfolio and investment portfolio due to faster prepayment experience 
interest rate risk of embedded positions including prepayment and early withdrawal options  lagged interest rate changes  administered interest rate products  and cap and floor options within products require a more dynamic measuring tool to capture earnings risk 
earnings simulation and economic value of equity are used to more completely assess interest rate risk 
along with the static gap analysis  determining the sensitivity of short term future earnings to a hypothetical plus or minus and basis point parallel rate shock can be accomplished through the use of simulation modeling 
in addition to the assumptions used to create the static gap  simulation of earnings includes the modeling of the balance sheet as an ongoing entity 
future business assumptions involving administered rate products  prepayments for future rate sensitive balances  and the reinvestment of maturing assets and liabilities are included 
these items are then modeled to project net interest income based on a hypothetical change in interest rates 
the resulting net interest income for the next month period is compared to the net interest income amount calculated using flat rates 
this difference represents the corporation s earnings sensitivity to a plus or minus basis point parallel rate shock 
the resulting simulations for december   projected that net interest income would increase by approximately of budgeted net interest income if rates rose by a basis point shock  and projected that the net interest income would decrease by approximately if rates fell by a basis point shock 
at december   the basis point shock up was projected to decrease budgeted net interest income by approximately  and the basis point shock down was projected to decrease budgeted net interest income by approximately 
economic value of equity is another tool used to measure the impact of interest rates on the present value of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments 
this measurement is a longer term analysis of interest rate risk as it evaluates every cash flow produced by the current balance sheet 
the projected changes for earnings simulation and economic value of equity for both and were within the corporation s interest rate risk policy 
the results of the modeling mirrored the other interest rate risk tests discussed above  as the corporation moved from a relatively neutral position at december  to asset sensitive at december  these results are based solely on immediate and sustained parallel changes in market rates and do not reflect the earnings sensitivity that may arise from other factors 
these factors may include changes in the shape of the yield curve  the change in spread between key market rates  or accounting recognition of the impairment of certain intangibles 
the above results are also considered to be conservative estimates due to the fact that no management action to mitigate potential income variances are included within the simulation process 
this action could include  but would not be limited to  delaying an increase in deposit rates  extending liabilities  using financial derivative products to hedge interest rate risk  changing the pricing characteristics of loans  or changing the growth rate of certain assets and liabilities 
the corporation uses interest rate derivative financial instruments as an asset liability management tool to hedge mismatches in interest rate exposure indicated by the net interest income simulation described above 
they are used to modify the corporation s exposures to interest rate fluctuations and provide more stable spreads between loan yields and the rate on their funding sources 
in  the corporation entered into million in notional amounts of new interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate risk 
interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate payments without the exchange of the underlying notional amount on which the interest payments are calculated 
table interest rate swap hedging portfolio notional balances and yield by maturity date maturity notional weighted average weighted average date amount rate received rate paid in thousands to hedge against rising interest rates  the corporation may use interest rate caps 
counterparties to these interest cap agreements pay the corporation based on the notional amount and the difference between current rates and strike rates 
at december   there were million of interest rate caps outstanding  which have a six month libor strike of 
to hedge against falling interest rates  the corporation may use interest rate floors 
like caps  counterparties to interest rate floor agreements pay the corporation based on the notional amount and the difference between current rates and strike rates 
there were no floors outstanding at december  derivative financial instruments are also discussed in note  derivative and hedging activities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations  commitments  off balance sheet risk  and contingent liabilities through the normal course of operations  the corporation has entered into certain contractual obligations and other commitments 
such obligations generally relate to funding of operations through deposits or debt issuances  as well as leases for premises and equipment 
as a financial services provider the corporation routinely enters into commitments to extend credit 
while contractual obligations represent future cash requirements of the corporation  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans made by the corporation 
the following table summarizes significant contractual obligations and other commitments at december  the payment amounts represent those amounts contractually due to the recipient and do not include any unamoritized premiums or discounts  hedge basis adjustments  or other similar carrying value adjustments 
further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in the referenced note to the consolidated financial statements 
table contractual obligations and other commitments note one year one to three to over reference or less three years five years five years total in thousands time deposits      long term funding and      operating leases      commitments to extend credit      total      the corporation also enters into derivative contracts under which the corporation is required to either receive cash from or pay cash to counterparties depending on changes in interest rates 
derivative contracts are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date 
the fair value of the contracts change daily as market interest rates change 
because the derivative liabilities recorded on the balance sheet at december  do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under these contracts  these liabilities are not included in the table of contractual obligations presented above 
further discussion of derivative instruments is included in note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  derivative and hedging activities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
a summary of significant commitments at december  is as follows in thousands commitments to extend credit  excluding commitments to originate mortgage loans  commitments to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale  total commitments to extend credit  commercial letters of credit  standby letters of credit  forward commitments to sell loans  further discussion of these commitments is included in note  commitments  off balance sheet risk  and contingent liabilities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements
