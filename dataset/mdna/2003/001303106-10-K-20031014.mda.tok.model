segment information during the year ended june  and  we were engaged solely in the business of manufacturing and distributing disposable gloves 
we have two business segments  manufacturing and distribution 
these segments are managed as separate strategic business units 
the manufacturing segment  which represents the indonesian operations of pt buana  manufactures powdered and powder free latex gloves and sells them primarily to ahpc and wrp asia 
the distribution segment involves the procurement and sale of gloves purchased from the manufacturing segment and other glove manufacturers and then sold to national and regional healthcare  foodservice  retail and other distributors within the us and also includes  to a significantly lesser extent  the sale of non glove disposable products 
discussion of the operations of each segment is included throughout the results of operations and liquidity and capital resources sections 
liquidity and capital resources year ended june  cash and cash equivalents  at june   were  a decrease of  from  at june  we experienced a decrease in cash flows for the year ended june   primarily from a decrease in net cash used in investing activities 
our operations provided cash of  during the fiscal year as a result of noncash depreciation and amortization of  and a decline in accounts receivable of  and an increase in accounts payable trade 
net inventories were  an increase of  from  at june  net trade accounts receivable at june  decreased by to  from  at june  this decline of  is primarily due to a decrease in revenues associated with the medical transition

the amount due from wrp asia  before allowance for doubtful accounts at june  was approximately  against which we have provided an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately  representing all amounts due for the sale of product from pt buana to wrp asia at june  
subsequent to june   we entered into a formal agreement with wrp asia to provide for full and complete right of offset of any trade payables due against amounts they owe to wrpc and ahpc 
in management s opinion  while wrp asia does not currently intend to seek protection from creditors  should such action take place  we would have to reevaluate the ability to offset payables to wrp asia against our receivables from them 
on july   wrp asia pacific sdn bhd wrp asia  successfully completed its financial restructuring involving total financing of approximately malaysian ringgit rm million us million 
the restructuring reduced wrp asia s debt position by rm million us million and resulted in the availability of rm million us million in new funding and an increase in the company s issued share capital from rm million us million to rm million us million 
the debt restructuring includes an investment by an established uk based fund management company  which has become a significant shareholder in wrp asia 
this participation further strengthens the solid mix of existing institutional shareholders  which consist of large and established private equity and investment funds 
on september   our board of directors passed a resolution that limits the net intercompany amount due from wrp asia exceeding the balance of  on a consolidated basis 
in the event that wrp asia desires to purchase product from pt buana  and the effect of this sale would be to increase the net amount due beyond  wpr asia will be required to support these purchases by payment of cash in advance or tender of an irrevocable letter of credit to pt buana to cover the purchase price of the order to the extent such amount exceeds on july   our board of directors approved a proposal submitted by the independent directors to form a special evaluation committee the committee

this agreement was scheduled to expire on june   however  we have entered into an amendment to the forbearance agreement that extends the term through december  upon expiration of this agreement  as amended  the lender will have the right to exercise its rights and remedies immediately  including but not limited to ceasing to make any further loans to us and the acceleration of our obligations to the lender 
we are taking aggressive measures to insure that we have adequate financing in the future  we are in discussions with several financial institutions about replacing our current credit facility 
we fully expect  but cannot guarantee  that we will be successful in replacing our existing credit facility  through either our existing lender or a new lender  prior to december  we are also in discussion with several potential investors regarding a significant equity investment 
we can make no assurances as to whether any investment proposals will be received and  if so  to what extent they will be dilutive to existing investors 
due to the nature of our business  importing product from asia and the extended time period required for those purchases to convert to cash  we rely on our credit facility to finance these purchases 
on july  wrp asia announced the completion of its financial restructuring  which involved restructuring and reducing wrp asia s debt position and providing additional new funding 
due to the terms of the restructuring wrp asia was prohibited from repaying certain debt  including our intercompany debt in the short term 
at that time we began exploring other opportunities to gain compliance with our lender s requirement of a paydown by wrp asia of it s intercompany debt and on september  entered into a non binding letter of intent with wrp asia to enter into a stock redemption and exchange agreement 
the letter of intent calls for us to redeem  shares of class a common stock and the  shares of class b common stock  which comprise all of wrp asia s holdings

we caution the reader that the following risks may not be exhaustive 
variations in quarterly results 
our quarterly operating results are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including risks and uncertainties related to local and international political and economic conditions  foreign currency volatility  competitive pressures  the composition  timing and size of orders from and shipments to major customers  variations in product mix and the size mix between sales  variations in product cost  infrastructure costs  obsolescence of inventory  and other factors as discussed below 
accordingly  our operating results may vary materially from quarter to quarter 
we operate with little backlog and  as a result  net sales in any quarter are substantially dependent on the orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and because a high percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed  if anticipated shipments in any quarter do not occur as expected  our operating results may be adversely affected and may fall significantly short of expectations 
any other unanticipated decline in the growth rate of our net revenues  without a corresponding and timely reduction in the growth of operating expenses  could also have an adverse effect on us and our future operating results 
we aim to prudently control our operating expenses 
however  there is no assurance that  in the event of any revenue  gross margin or other shortfall in a quarter  we will be able to control expenses sufficiently to meet profitability objectives for the quarter 
financing 
our credit facility  which was due to expire in august   has been renewed and extended until december  the terms and conditions are similar to those in the current credit facility 
dependence on gloves 
we are currently almost exclusively engaged in the manufacture and sale of disposable gloves 
accordingly  our results of operations and financial condition are highly dependent on the level of supply of and demand for disposable gloves 
there can be no assurance that the supply of or demand for disposable gloves will continue at current levels or that changes in such supply or such demand will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition dependence on rubber harvest and latex concentrate 
our ability to produce and purchase our products profitably is entirely dependent upon the consistent availability  at competitive prices  of raw rubber harvested by independent growers in malaysia  thailand and indonesia and locally processed by others and us into latex concentrate 
any disruption in the consistent supply of rubber for latex concentrate due to weather or other natural phenomena  labor or transportation stoppages  shortages or other factors  could cause significant adverse effects to our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  rubber is a commodity traded on world commodities exchanges and is subject to price fluctuations driven by changing market conditions over which we have no control 
during the year ended june   the price of latex concentrate increased by as much as  causing us to incur higher cost of goods sold 
asia pacific risk factors 
social  political and economic instability may be significantly greater in many of the asian pacific countries than that typically associated with the united states and other industrialized countries 
varying degrees of social  political and economic instability could significantly disrupt the source of our supply of glove products 
currencies of several asian pacific countries  including indonesia  korea  malaysia  philippines  singapore  taiwan and thailand  have experienced significant fluctuations against the us dollar 
our indonesian factory maintains its books in the indonesian currency  the rupiah  and reports its indonesian income taxes with rupiah financial reports 
the indonesian rupiah experienced volatile currency fluctuations against the us dollar  which caused significant income tax adjustments in foreign currency exchange volatility may continue and could cause us to incur significant income tax adjustments in the future 
in the past  interest rates in many asian pacific countries are heavily dependent upon international trade and are accordingly affected by protective trade barriers and the economic conditions of their trading partners  principally  the united states  japan  china and the european union 
the enactment by the united states or other principal trading partners of protectionist trade legislation  reduction of foreign investment in the local economies and general declines in the international securities markets could have a significant adverse effect upon the economies of the asian pacific countries 
governments in certain of the asian pacific countries participate to a significant degree  through ownership interests or regulation  in their respective economies 
action by these governments could have a significant adverse effect on the economies of such countries 
changes in gross margins 
certain of our net product sales are derived from products and markets which typically have lower gross margins compared to other products and markets  due to higher costs and or lower prices associated with the lower gross margin products and markets 
we currently expect that our net product sales from powder free and synthetic gloves will continue to increase as a percentage of total net product sales 
in addition  we are currently experiencing pricing pressures due to a number of factors  including competitive conditions  consolidation within certain groups of suppliers  excess supply of products  changing technologies in the production of powder free gloves and increasing demand for new glove products 
additionally  we may not be able to pass on price increases to our customers in a timely manner  or at all 
to the extent that these factors continue  our gross margins could decline  which would adversely affect us and our future operating results 
downward pressure on our gross margins may be mitigated by other factors  such as a reduction in product costs and or an increased percentage of new product sales from higher gross margin products  such as powder free and synthetic gloves 
we are aiming to reduce our product costs and to increase our percentage of net product sales from powder free and synthetic gloves 
however  there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful 
complimentary products 
the foodservice  industrial and retail industries look at our current line of product offerings as just one of a bundle of safety products used by their customers 
developing a profitable line of additional products will be important to the future success of our business 
during  we diversified our product offerings with additional synergistic product lines that address the current safety requirements of our markets 
these additional product offerings include polygloves  heavy duty gloves  headwear  aprons and bibs  food storage bags and educational services 
these products are being offered under our safeprep brand and under private label 
growth dependencies 
in general  our future growth is dependent on our ability to successfully and timely enhance existing products  develop and introduce new products  establish new distribution channels  develop affiliations with leading market participants and continue to develop our relationships with our existing customer base 
the failure to achieve these and other objectives could limit future growth and have an adverse effect on both us and our future operating results 
in addition  the pressure to develop and enhance products and to establish and expand markets may cause our sg a expenses to increase  which could also have an adverse effect on us and our future operating results 
manufacturing in indonesia international operations 
our international manufacturing operation has grown substantially and  thus  we are increasingly affected by the risks associated with international operations 
such risks include managing an organization in indonesia  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  the burden of complying with international laws and other regulatory and product certification requirements  changes in such laws and requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  import and export controls  international staffing and employment issues  and political and economic stability 
the inability to effectively control and manage these and other risks could adversely affect both our future operating results and us 
competition 
the various markets in which we operate are becoming increasingly competitive as a number of other companies develop and sell products that compete with our products in these markets 
certain of these competitors have significantly more financial and technical resources than us 
we face additional competitive factors besides price  such as product quality  timeliness of delivery  service and the size and reliability of the manufacturer 
these competitive factors may result in  among other things  price discounts by us and sales lost by us to competitors that may adversely affect on our future operating results and us 
reliance upon distributors 
we use various channels to market and distribute our products to end users via third party distributors 
third party distributors are a substantial channel for distribution to end users 
accordingly  our ability to market and distribute our products depends significantly on our relationship with third party distributors  as well as the performance and financial condition of these distributors 
in the event that our relationship with these distributors deteriorates or the performance or financial condition of the distributor becomes unsatisfactory  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
reliance upon significant contracts and customers 
during the year ended june   of net sales came from one customer 
the loss of this customer could have a materially adverse impact on us 
excess or obsolete inventory 
managing our inventory of various size mix and product mix is a complex task 
a number of factors  including the need to maintain a significant inventory of certain sizes or products which are in short supply or which must be purchased in bulk to obtain favorable pricing  the general unpredictability of demand for specific products and customer requests for quick delivery schedules  may result in us maintaining excess inventory 
other factors  including changes in market demand and technology  may cause inventory to become obsolete 
any excess or obsolete inventory could result in price reductions and inventory write downs  which  in turn  could adversely affect on our operating results 
hiring and retention of employees 
our continued growth and success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of senior management and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees 
competition for highly skilled business  technical  marketing and other personnel is intense 
the loss of one or more key employees or our inability to attract additional qualified employees or retain other employees could have an adverse effect on our operating results and us 
in addition  we may experience increased compensation costs in order to compete for skilled employees 
product liability insurance 
participants in the medical supplies business are potentially subject to lawsuits alleging product liability  many of which involve significant damage claims and defense costs 
a successful claim against us in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
claims made against us  regardless of their merit  could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation 
there is no assurance that the coverage limits of our insurance policy will be adequate or that present levels of coverage will be available at affordable rates in the future 
while we have been able to obtain product liability insurance in the past  such insurance varies in cost  is difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all 
we are subject to a number of lawsuits filed against us and other manufacturers 
there can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient to meet any recovery for which we may be found liable  that the outcome of such suits will not materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition  or that our deductible obligation to fund a portion of the initial cost of defense and or liability of each such lawsuit will not prove financially burdensome 
stock market fluctuations 
in recent years  the stock market in general  including our common stock  has experienced extreme price fluctuations 
the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by various factors such as quarterly variations in our operating results  changes in our revenue growth rates  the loss of a significant customer or sales contract  changes in earnings estimates by market analysis  the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  speculation in the press or analyst community  the inability of the market to absorb selling pressure from one or more large institutional shareholders  and general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries 
there can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will not experience significant fluctuations in the future 
governmental regulations 
our products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries  particularly to safety and adherence to quality system regulations qsr s for medical devices 
in the united states  examination gloves are classified as a class i medical device product regulated by the fda 
noncompliance with these fda regulations can result in administrative enforcement  such as warning letters  import alerts  administrative detention or in civil penalties  product bans and recalls 
periodically  the fda inspects shipments of medical gloves as they arrive in the united states ports 
the fda inspections and reviews may cause delays in product delivery and this can result in a loss or delay in recognition of sales and income by us 
in addition  the fda may inspect the manufacturing facilities for compliance with qsr s  which incorporate pre production design and development to achieve consistency with quality system requirements worldwide 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 
west coast longshoremen work stoppage 
on september   the pacific maritime association pma  which represents international shipping lines  indefinitely locked out the longshoremen  effectively stopping all import and export activity on west coast ports 
this followed a hour lockout that began on september  these shutdowns were in reaction to work slowdowns by the international longshoremen s warehouse union ilwu  which were taking place over the last several weeks 
on october  the us district court in san francisco issue a temporary restraining order under the authority of the taft hartley act that requires the ports to reopen 
on october  the ports reopened 
we estimate the costs of this shutdown to be  we depend heavily on us seaports  especially west coast ports where all of our imports are entered 
we have contingency plans in place in the event another work stoppage should occur 
these plans include  among other things  air freighting product  locating alternative sources and redirecting existing inventory 
we cannot guarantee that any of these contingency plans would adequately protect us from loss in the event that a similar work stoppage or strike should occur in the future
