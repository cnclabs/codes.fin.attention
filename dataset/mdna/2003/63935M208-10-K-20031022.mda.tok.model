the audit report on our fiscal year consolidated financial statements from kpmg llp  our independent auditors  contains an explanatory paragraph that states that our recurring losses since inception and accumulated deficit  as well as other factors  raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
during fiscal year and thereafter  we have undergone a significant transition  including all of the acquisitions that are described in this report and a balance sheet restructuring  to position ourselves among the leaders in the hosting and managed applications services market 
included in this transition was a complete turnover of our senior management team and our board of directors 
while we cannot assure you that we will continue as a going concern  as part of our transition efforts we believe that we have developed and are implementing an operational plan that will bring costs more in line with projected revenue growth

total revenue for fiscal year increased to approximately million from approximately million in fiscal year the overall growth in revenue was mainly due to revenue resulting from our acquisitions  which contributed million in revenue during fiscal year offset by lost customer revenue of million 
revenue from non related parties increased by to approximately million in fiscal year from approximately million in fiscal year but was offset by a decline in revenue from related parties 
revenue from related parties decreased by to approximately million in fiscal year from approximately million in revenue from related parties principally consisted of sales of services to cmgi and its affiliates until september  when cmgi sold its equity and debt interests in navisite 
the decrease in related party revenue was primarily attributable to cmgi and its affiliates terminating their relationships with navisite upon the completion of their contracts 

table of contents total revenue for fiscal year decreased to approximately million from approximately million in fiscal year included in fiscal year revenue is approximately million in non recurring revenue from settlements primarily from related parties 
excluding settlement revenue  total revenue for fiscal year decreased to approximately million from approximately million in fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year revenue  net of settlement revenue  resulted from a million  or  decrease in unaffiliated revenue combined with a million  or  decrease in revenue from cmgi and its affiliates 
in fiscal year  one non related customer accounted for of our revenue as compared to fiscal year where one cmgi affiliate accounted for approximately of our revenue and fiscal year where four cmgi affiliates accounted for approximately   and of our revenue  respectively 
during fiscal year  we adopted sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
under sab  installation fees are recognized over the life of the related customer contracts 
prior to fiscal year  we recognized installation fees at the time the installation occurred 
the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle on all prior years resulted in a million increase in net loss for the year ended july  and is reflected as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
revenue for the year ended july  includes million that was included in the cumulative effect adjustment 
the million of fiscal year revenue was primarily attributable to the recognition of previously deferred revenue from customers lost during fiscal year cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of salaries and benefits for operations personnel  bandwidth fees and related internet connectivity charges  equipment costs and related depreciation and costs to run our data centers  such as rent and utilities 
cost of revenue  excluding impairment charges  decreased to approximately million in fiscal year from approximately million in fiscal year the reduction in cost of revenue of million  net of impairment charges  resulted primarily from reductions in depreciation of million  equipment lease and related costs of million due to restructuring that took place in fiscal year partially offset by increases in labor costs of million  bandwidth costs of million and software licenses of million related to acquisitions made in fiscal year cost of revenue  excluding impairment charges  decreased to approximately million in fiscal year  from approximately million in fiscal year the reduction in cost of revenue of million  net of impairment charges  resulted from a million reduction in equipment lease and related costs  a million reduction in labor costs due to head count reductions  a million reduction in consulting fees  a million reduction in bandwidth and bandwidth related costs  a million reduction in rent costs related to the shut down of our original data centers on july   and a million reduction in other facility and equipment related costs offset by a million increase in depreciation resulting from the purchase of certain equipment formerly held under operating lease 
included in cost of revenue for fiscal years and are impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
in fiscal year  we recorded a million impairment charge related to certain leased and owned equipment and long lived assets 
the components of this charge are as follows as a result of a physical inventory of its customer dedicated equipment  navisite recorded an impairment charge of million for obsolete equipment and for equipment no longer on hand and identified certain excess assets not in use 
navisite modified the payment amounts and terms of certain operating leases with three equipment vendors such that the modified leases qualify as capital leases 
one of the resulting capital leases is payable in monthly payments of  starting in december the second capital lease has total payments of million  of which million was paid in the second quarter of fiscal year and million was paid in fiscal year the third capital lease is payable in monthly payments of  for the first four months and  for the remaining months  starting in april the 
table of contents equipment under all resulting capital leases was capitalized at the fair market value of the equipment at the time of the modification  million  which was lower than the present value of the future minimum lease payments based on navisite s estimated incremental borrowing rate of 
since the fair market value of the equipment was less than the consideration given  based on a third party appraisal  navisite recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately million 
in addition  navisite returned certain equipment held under certain operating leases with one of the above lessors and incurred and paid a breakage fee of  navisite recorded a net million charge representing the future estimated remaining minimum lease payments related to certain idle equipment held under various operating leases 
the equipment had previously been rented to former customers under operating leases  and upon the loss of the customer  the equipment became idle 
based on our then forecasts  the equipment would not be utilized before the related operating leases expired and or the equipment became obsolete 
navisite evaluated the current and forecasted utilization of its purchased software licenses 
as a result of this evaluation  during the second quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a  impairment for software licenses that would not be utilized before the licenses expired and or became obsolete 
navisite finalized agreements with various equipment lessors whereby we purchased equipment previously held under operating leases for approximately million 
the fair market value of the equipment at the time of purchase  based on third party appraisal  was approximately million 
as the aggregate fair market value of the equipment  based on third party appraisal  was less than the aggregate consideration given  we recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately million  as a separate component of cost of revenue  in fiscal year a number of factors occurring during the fourth quarter of fiscal year impacted our long lived assets including both our expected future cash flow generation and our expected utilization of the assets within revised operating plans 
these factors included the further deterioration of market conditions within our industry  excess capacity in the industry and in our two data centers  our anticipated data center utilization and our revised business model 
based on these factors and their impact on current and future projected cash flows  we performed an assessment of the carrying value of our long lived assets pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the conclusion of this assessment was that the decline in market conditions within our industry were significant and other than temporary 
in this assessment  we reviewed our long lived assets  which included property  equipment and goodwill 
the carrying amount of goodwill  which totaled  was considered unrecoverable and was written off as of july  and was included as a component of general and administrative expense 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the measurement of the impairment loss of property and equipment was based on the fair value of the asset  as determined by third party appraisal 
management determined that the best measure of fair value for the property and equipment was a combination of the market and cost approaches 
the cost approach was utilized to determine the fair value of certain computer hardware  leasehold improvements  office furniture and equipment and construction in progress 
the cost approach utilizes estimated replacement reproduction cost  with allowances for physical depreciation and functional obsolescence ie asset utilization 
for certain equipment and leasehold improvements  the market approach was used 
the market approach typically includes comparing recent sales of similar assets and adjusting these comparable transactions based on factors such as age  condition  and type of sale to determine fair value 
based on the appraised fair value of the property and equipment  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year included in the fiscal year cost of revenue is a charge of approximately million related to certain equipment under operating leases  which had been deemed not to have a future economic benefit to us 

table of contents product development product development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs

general and administrative expenses also included a  legal settlement paid to level 
impairment and restructuring costs associated with impairment  restructuring and abandonment of lease facilities increased to approximately million in fiscal year compared to approximately million in fiscal year 
table of contents the increase is due primarily to abandonment of administrative space at our minuteman road  andover  ma facility and the abandonment of administrative space at our la jolla  ca office 
we recorded a charge equal to the amount of rent and other direct costs for the period and time the space is expected to remain unoccupied plus the present value of the amount by which the rent paid by us to the landlord exceeds any rent paid to us by a subtenant under a sublease over the remainder of the lease term 
in july  we announced a plan  approved by our board of directors  to restructure our operations and consolidate our data centers  which resulted in a charge of approximately million  of which approximately million was accrued for as of july  of the total restructuring charge  approximately million was related to employee termination benefits 
we terminated employees on july  the restructuring charge also included approximately million of costs related to the closing of our two original data centers

the accrual for the two original data centers was reduced by approximately million and the bandwidth termination costs were reduced by approximately million 
in addition   in severance employee costs were forfeited by former employees 
as a result  we reversed approximately million in restructuring accrual during fiscal year as of july   we had completed the restructuring plan and made all related payments

other income expense  net other expense increased to approximately  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year this increase is mainly due to increase fees related to the accounts receivable financing line with silicon valley bank 
other income expense decreased to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year the decrease is due to the loss on the sale of certain assets offset by the gain realized on the sale of certain of our streaming media assets 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents decreased to approximately million at july  from approximately million at july  net cash used in operating activities was approximately million for the year ended july   resulting primarily from net losses  decreases in accrued expenses and accounts payables  and a decrease in amounts due to cmgi  partially offset by non cash charges for the write off and amortization of the beneficial conversion feature of the convertible debt  interest paid in 
table of contents stock  costs related to abandoned leases  impairment of assets  depreciation and amortization  and provision for bad debt 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended july   resulting primarily from purchases of property and equipment  the purchase of certain assets of interliant  the purchase of convertible notes of interliant  a loan made to a related party  partially offset by cash acquired in acquisitions and the release of restricted cash 
net cash used for financing activities was approximately  for the fiscal year ended july   resulting primarily from repayment of debt to the estate of appliedtheory  repayment of notes to affiliates  the payment of capital lease obligations  partially offset by borrowings from affiliates and borrowings from our accounts receivable financing line 
at july   we had a working capital deficit of million  an accumulated deficit of million  and have reported losses from operations since incorporation 
we have used cash from continuing operations of million  million and million in the years ended july    and  respectively 
we anticipate incurring additional losses throughout our next fiscal year 
navisite has taken several actions it believes will allow us to continue as a going concern through july   including the closing and integration of strategic acquisitions  the change in our board of directors and senior management and bringing costs more in line with projected revenues 
based upon our cash flow estimates we believe that we will more than likely need to raise funds to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
our cash flow estimates are based upon attaining certain levels of sales  maintaining budgeted levels of operating expenses  collections of accounts receivable and maintaining our current borrowing line with silicon valley bank among other assumptions  including the improvement in the overall macroeconomic environment 
our sales estimate includes revenue from new and existing customers which may not be realized and we may be required to further reduce expenses if budgeted sales are not attained 
we may be unsuccessful in reducing expenses in proportion to any shortfall in projected sales and our estimate of collections of accounts receivable may be hindered by our customers ability to pay 
we believe that we will more than likely need to raise funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  or through credit arrangements with financial institutions 
we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
if funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and our stockholders may experience dilution of their interest in us 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to continue as a going concern 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments in the normal course of our business  we enter into contracts related to the leasing of facilities and equipment and the purchase of minimum bandwidth 
future payments required under these long term obligations are as follows less than after description total year years years years short long term debt interest on debt capital leases operating leases bandwidth commitments maintenance for hardware software property leases critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  management is required to make certain estimates  
table of contents judgments and assumptions that they believe are reasonable based on the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and impairment of long lived assets 
revenue recognition 
we provide outsourced hosting and managed application services and related professional and consulting services 
revenue consists of monthly fees for web site and internet application management  application rentals  and hosting 
revenues related to monthly fees for web site and internet application management  application rentals and hosting are recognized over the term of the customer contract based on actual usage and services 
revenue from professional services is recognized on a time and materials basis as the services are performed or under the percentage of completion method for revenue related to fixed price contracts 
revenue and profits on long term internet solutions contracts  performed over extended periods  are recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting  principally based on direct labor dollars 
revenues and profits on long term contracts are based on our estimates to complete and are reviewed periodically  with adjustments recorded in the period in which the revisions are made 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
fees charged for the installation of customer equipment are generally received in advance and are deferred and recognized as revenue over the life of the related customer contract  typically to months 
in the event a customer terminates the agreement prior to its stated maturity  all deferred revenue related to installation services is automatically recognized upon the effective date of the termination  and we generally charge cancellation or termination fees that are also recognized upon the effective date of the termination 
cancellation fees are calculated as the customer s remaining base monthly fees obligation times the number of months remaining in the contract term 
existing customers are subject to ongoing credit evaluations based on payment history and other factors 
if it is determined subsequent to our initial evaluation and at any time during the arrangement that collectability is not reasonably assured  revenue is recognized as cash is received 
due to the nature of our service arrangements  we provide written notice of termination of services  typically days in advance of disconnecting a customer 
revenue for services rendered during this notification period is recognized on a cash basis as collectability is not considered probable at the time the services are provided 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions and generally do not require collateral or other security against trade receivables 
we make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential credit losses 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and consider historical bad debts  customer and industry concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we specifically reserve for of the balance of customer accounts deemed uncollectible 
for all other customer accounts  we reserve for of the balance over days old and of all other customer balances 
this method historically approximated actual write off experience 
changes in economic conditions or the financial viability of our customers may result in additional provisions for doubtful accounts in excess of our current estimate 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets  primarily property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  
table of contents significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets were considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending on the nature of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are valued at the lower of the carrying amount or their fair value less disposal costs 
property and equipment is primarily comprised of leasehold improvements  computer and office equipment and software licenses 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  due to significant industry and economic trends affecting both our current and future operations as well as a significant decline in our stock price  we completed an impairment review of our property and equipment 
this review included a comparison of the carrying amount of such assets to the estimated fair values of the specific assets 
management determined that the best measure of fair value for the property and equipment was a combination of the market and cost approaches 
the cost approach was utilized to determine the fair value of certain computer hardware  leasehold improvements  office furniture and equipment and construction in progress 
the cost approach utilizes estimated replacement reproduction costs  with allowances for physical depreciation and functional obsolescence ie  asset utilization 
for certain equipment and leasehold improvements  the market approach was used 
the market approach typically includes comparing recent sales of similar assets and adjusting these comparable transactions based on factors such as age  condition  and types of sale to determine fair value 
based on the appraised fair value of the property and equipment  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year the selection of valuation methodologies and approaches  as well as assumptions of future asset utilization  requires judgments and estimates 
the use of different valuation methodologies or assumptions could have increased or decreased the impairment charge 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents 
from time to time  we invest our excess cash in money market funds 
we do not currently have any significant foreign operations and thus are not materially exposed to foreign currency fluctuations
