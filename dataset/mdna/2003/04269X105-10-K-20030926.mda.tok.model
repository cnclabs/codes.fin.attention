item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of which involve significant risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below and those described more fully under the caption risk factors above and elsewhere in this report  and in other reports we have filed with the securities and exchange commission 
because these statements reflect our current expectations concerning future events  our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
these factors include  but are not limited to  our ability to achieve and maintain profitability  the extent to which the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are willing to collaborate with and fund third parties on their drug discovery activities  the ability of our collaborators and of array to meet drug discovery objectives tied to milestones and royalties  our ability to continue to fund and successfully progress internal research efforts  and our ability to attract and retain experienced scientists and management 
we are providing the information in this annual report filed on form k as of the date of this report 
we undertake no duty to update any forward looking statements to reflect the effect on those statements of subsequent events or changes in our expectations or assumptions 
overview array biopharma is a drug discovery company creating new small molecule drugs through the integration of chemistry  biology and informatics 
our experienced scientists use the array discovery platform  our integrated set of drug discovery technologies  to invent novel small molecule drugs in collaboration with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and for our own pipeline of proprietary drug candidates 
we have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur losses in the near future as we expand our scientific staff  proprietary drug discovery programs and continue to scale up our operations 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities and revenue from our collaborators 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we generate revenue by researching  designing  synthesizing and screening chemical compounds for the invention of drug candidates for our collaborators 
we report revenue from collaboration agreements  which include lead generation and lead optimization services  custom synthesis and process research and the development and sale of chemical compounds  as collaboration revenue in our statement of operations 
license  royalty and milestone revenue are combined and reported separately from collaboration revenue 
our collaborations include lead generation  lead optimization  custom synthesis and process research and development 
we provide lead generation services  including structural biology and screening compound libraries  to invent lead candidates for our collaborators and lead optimization services to refine and optimize potential drug candidates 
we also design  synthesize and provide libraries of chemical compounds or single compounds to our collaborators on a custom basis  with either an exclusive or non exclusive license to use the compounds 
we assist collaborators in process research and development  which involves developing the processes to make  and synthesizing for delivery  the larger quantities of chemical compounds required for clinical testing 
we also produce chemical compounds in our cgmp manufacturing facility that meet cgmp requirements for phase i clinical testing 
in fiscal  we first used this facility to produce bulk material for clinical testing of our most advanced proprietary development program 
we license our lead generation libraries  which are a collection of structurally related chemical compounds that may have the potential of becoming drug candidates  on a non exclusive basis to our collaborators for internal research purposes 
we retain all other rights to the compounds  which permits us to license the same compounds to other customers 
some of our agreements allow our collaborators to obtain exclusive rights to commercialize particular compounds upon the payment of additional fees 
we sell our optimer building blocks  which are the starting materials used to create more complex chemical compounds in the drug discovery process  on a per compound basis without any restrictions on use 
we are also paid under our collaboration agreements based on the number of full time equivalent employees contractually assigned to a project  plus certain expenses 
custom collections of chemical compounds we create and custom chemical syntheses we perform under our collaboration agreements are typically charged on a per compound basis  plus a charge for research and development services 
in addition  seven of our current  and three of our past collaboration agreements provide for additional payments upon the achievement of certain drug development milestones  and seven of our collaboration agreements provide for royalty payments based on sales of products created as a result of these collaborations 
three of our past collaboration agreements provided an up front license or technology access fee  and one of our collaboration agreements currently generates a low level of royalty payments 
in general  our collaborators may terminate their collaboration agreement with us on to days prior notice 
we earned our first milestone payment from icos corporation in november with the commencement of a phase i clinical trial on a jointly identified drug candidate 
even though we have increased the number of our collaboration agreements  our top collaborators contributed over of our total revenue for fiscal and our top three collaborators  icos  merck co  inc  and eli lilly and company  accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenue 
during the fiscal year ended june   icos  pfizer inc  merck  and eli lilly accounted for   and  respectively  of our total revenue 
we recognize revenue from full time equivalent fees under our collaboration agreements on a monthly basis as work is performed 
development and fixed fee revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
per compound revenue is recognized as compounds are shipped 
revenue from license fees and up front fees is recognized over the term of the license or over the expected term of the collaboration agreement 
royalty revenue is recorded when earned 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue based upon the stage of completion of our performance obligations under the related contract 
cost of revenue consists mainly of compensation  associated fringe benefits and other collaboration related costs  including recruiting and relocation  fine chemicals  supplies  small tools  facilities  depreciation and other direct and indirect chemical handling and laboratory support costs  excluding any costs related to research and development 
any required inventory valuation adjustments are charged directly to cost of revenue 
research and development expenses consist of the same type of scientific expenditures that comprise cost of revenue  except that the expenses are related to the development of our early stage intellectual property and compounds where we have not yet proven technological feasibility 
costs associated with activities where technological feasibility has been proven are charged directly to cost of revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist mainly of compensation and associated fringe benefits and other management  business development  accounting  information technology and administration costs  including recruiting and relocation  consulting and professional services  travel and meals  advertising  sales commissions  facilities  depreciation and other office expenses 
in addition  termination related costs associated with a reduction in workforce completed in march for approximately  were recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses 
we currently license or sell our compounds and enter into collaborations directly with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies through opportunities identified by our business development group  senior management  scientists and customer referrals 
in addition  we license or sell our compounds and collaborations in japan through an agent 
international revenue represented of our total revenue during fiscal year  up slightly from for fiscal year our international revenue is attributed to both european and japanese collaborations 
all of our collaboration agreements and purchase orders are denominated in united states dollars 
we plan to continue to grow revenue with our existing collaborators and realize new revenue streams through collaborations with a diversified group of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
in addition  we expect to enter into additional agreements that allow us to participate in the success of potential drug candidates with our collaborators through milestone and or royalty payments 
we also expect to enter into agreements to participate in the success of our proprietary potential drug candidates through a combination of licensing fees  payments for continued research and down stream payments that include milestone and or royalty payments 
deferred stock compensation we recorded compensation expense related to stock option grants of million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the compensation expense related to stock option grants is charged to cost of revenue  research and development expenses  and selling  general and administrative expenses  based on the functional responsibility of the associated employee 
as of june   we had a million remaining deferred stock compensation to be amortized 
we expect to amortize this deferred stock compensation through march   as follows million in fiscal year and approximately  in fiscal year deemed dividend upon issuance of convertible preferred stock on august   we issued  shares of our series c convertible preferred stock at per share to investors  resulting in gross proceeds of million 
all outstanding shares of series c convertible preferred stock converted on a one for one basis into shares of common stock upon the effectiveness of our initial public offering 
subsequent to the commencement of the initial public offering process  we reevaluated the fair value of our series c convertible preferred stock as of august   and determined it to be per share 
accordingly  the incremental fair value of million  or per share  was deemed to be the equivalent of a dividend on our series c convertible preferred stock 
we recorded the deemed dividend at the date of issuance by offsetting charges and credits to preferred stock  without any effect on total stockholders equity 
the deemed preferred stock dividend increases the loss applicable to common stockholders in the calculation of basic net loss per share for fiscal year and all related interim periods 
results of operations fiscal years ended june   and increase decrease years ended june  to to in thousands collaboration revenue    license  royalty and milestone revenue   total revenue    fiscal as compared to fiscal total revenue increased slightly in this increase was primarily the result of million of additional revenue generated from our lead optimization collaborations with icos  vertex pharmaceuticals incorporated  takeda chemical industries  ltd  japan tobacco  syrrx  and intermune  and our custom library collaboration with a japanese collaborator 
this gain was partially offset by decreased revenue from subscriptions and sales of chemical compounds from our array discovery platform of million in compared to this decrease is attributed to the net reduction of million of sales of chemical compounds to a single major pharmaceutical company 
fiscal as compared to fiscal total revenue increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this is the result of increased sales in all business areas  and most significantly from subscriptions to our lead generation libraries and sales of our optimer building blocks  as well as collaborations for lead optimization and custom libraries 
sales of our lead generation libraries and optimer building blocks increased by million in fiscal year approximately of this increase is attributed to a single major pharmaceutical company 
revenue from our lead optimization collaborations increased by million in fiscal year this increase was primarily the result of our new collaboration agreements in fiscal year  as well as expanded collaborations with our existing customers 
revenue from our custom library collaboration increased by million resulting from additional delivered compounds 
increase years ended june  to to in thousands cost of revenue    gross margin of revenue fiscal as compared to fiscal cost of revenue increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year during fiscal year  we increased the inventory reserves for our lead generation libraries  resulting in a non cash charge of million 
the carrying values for our lead generation libraries were reduced in light of the difficult market conditions and resulting decline in lead generation library revenue experienced during the second half of fiscal for the fiscal year of  gross margin was compared to for the fiscal year of the increased cost of revenue and reduced gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal is related to not only the inventory reserve adjustment described above  but increased costs to support the growth in our lead optimization collaborations over the same period 
these cost increases were primarily attributed to additional scientific staff  associated salaries and benefits  and the expenditures associated with equipping and commencing operations in our new and expanded facilities during the year 
also  during we had a lower percentage of total revenue generated from subscriptions and sales of chemical compounds from our array discovery platform 
fiscal as compared to fiscal cost of revenue increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  reflecting the increased cost to support our revenue growth 
the cost increases in fiscal year were primarily attributed to additional scientific staff  associated salaries and benefits  and the expenditures associated with equipping and commencing operations in our new and expanded facilities 
the improved gross margin of of revenue in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year was due primarily to a greater percentage of total revenue in from subscriptions and sales of chemical compounds from our array discovery platform and relatively stable recruiting and relocation and other fixed costs  and declining compensation related to stock option grants 
increase years ended june  to to in thousands research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery    for collaborations    total research and development    fiscal as compared to fiscal total research and development expenses increased to million for fiscal  a increase from million in the expansion of our own proprietary drug discovery efforts was the main reason for the increase  and to a lesser degree spending for our lead generation libraries  optimer building blocks and custom library collaborations 
these expanded research efforts required the recruitment and relocation of additional scientific staff and associated salaries and benefits  and the expenditures associated with equipping and commencing operations in our new and expanded facilities 
fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year approximately million of the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal year was attributed to expansion of our own proprietary drug discovery  while the remainder of the increase was for our lead generation libraries  optimer building blocks and custom library collaborations 
these expanded research efforts required the recruitment and relocation of additional scientific staff and associated salaries and benefits  and the expenditures associated with equipping and commencing operations in our new and expanded facilities 
increase decrease years ended june  to to in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses    fiscal as compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased to million  or from during march  we reduced our workforce by employees in order to reduce costs and match our headcount resources with the near term demand for our collaboration programs 
this reduction resulted in a charge to selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately  for termination related costs consisting primarily of severance payments and out placement services for affected employees 
as of june   approximately  of these costs had been paid  and we expect that the remaining costs will be paid by september  selling  general and administrative expenses also increased during fiscal due to expanded management and increased business development and administrative staffing levels as well as increased facilities related expenditures 
fiscal as compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal year due to the decline in compensation related to stock option grants  which exceeded the added cost of our increased staffing levels and expanded management 
decrease years ended june  to to in thousands compensation related to option grants    fiscal as compared to fiscal compensation related to stock option grants in decreased to million  or compared to the decrease is the result of the expiration of unvested options upon termination of employment 
this non cash charge is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting periods of the related options  which are generally four years  except for options with performance based vesting provisions 
fiscal as compared to fiscal compensation related to stock option grants decreased to million in  compared to million in because of the accelerated vesting of options in upon the closing of our initial public offering in november increase decrease years ended june  to to in thousands net interest income   fiscal as compared to fiscal interest income in of  was down from million in due to lower interest rates earned on investments and a lower average cash balance 
we incurred no interest expense in either year 
fiscal as compared to fiscal we had interest income of million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year the decrease in interest income is the result of lower interest rates earned on investments  which more than offset our increased average cash balance 
we did not incur interest expense in fiscal year  compared to approximately  in fiscal year the decrease resulted from the full repayment of all equipment loan facilities and lines of credit obligations in may and june during fiscal year  in connection with the early extinguishment of these debts  we incurred approximately  of charges related to prepayment penalties charged by the respective financial institutions 
included in this amount was a noncash charge of approximately  related to the unamortized debt discount associated with warrants issued to the lenders 
other expense unrealized loss on investment 
in march  we entered into a drug discovery collaboration agreement with aptus genomics  inc to create small molecule therapeutics against select g protein coupled receptor gpcr targets 
array worked exclusively with aptus on a select number of gpcr targets and provided aptus access to its lead generation libraries in exchange for  of common stock in aptus 
during fiscal  the value of aptus common stock decreased significantly 
we determined this reduced value to be other than temporary and as a result  wrote off our full investment in the company 
income taxes 
there is no current or deferred tax expense for the fiscal years ended june   or at june   we had federal and colorado income tax net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of million  which will expire beginning in and continuing through we have provided a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets  as realization of such tax benefits is not assured 
liquidity and capital resources as of june  in thousands cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities   working capital excluding cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities property  plant and equipment  gross    cash flow provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    fiscal as compared to fiscal we have historically funded our operations through revenue from our collaborations and the issuance of equity securities 
as of june   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million compared to million at june  net cash used in operating activities was million for fiscal year  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the same period in during fiscal year  our net loss of million was reduced by noncash charges of million associated with depreciation  compensation related to stock option grants and the unrealized investment loss  yet our working capital increased by million 
working capital rose primarily due to declining liability balances within accounts payable and advance payments from customers 
during fiscal year  we invested million in capital equipment and leasehold improvements associated with equipping and commencing operations in our new and expanded facilities 
financing activities provided million of cash primarily related to exercise of stock options under our stock option plan and the issuance of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
approximately  was received in september from one of array s founders as full repayment of an outstanding note receivable balance  including accrued interest 
fiscal as compared to fiscal as of june   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million compared to million at june  during fiscal year  net cash provided by operating activities was million  an improvement from net cash used of million for fiscal year this improvement was the result of the reduced net loss in fiscal year our net loss of million in fiscal year included noncash charges of million for depreciation and million for compensation related to stock option grants 
working capital increased during fiscal year by approximately  due to the increase in our inventories and accounts receivable  as a result of our growth  which exceeded the increase in accounts payable and advance payments from customers 
in fiscal year  we invested million in capital equipment and leasehold improvements 
equity financing activities provided million of cash consisting of million in net proceeds from our public offering of common stock in february and million from the exercise of stock options under our stock option plan and the issuance of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the rate at which we grow our business and our investment in proprietary research activities  the ability of our current and future collaborators to fund outside research and development activities  our success in increasing sales of both existing and new products and collaborations  expenses associated with unforeseen litigation  regulatory changes  competition  technological developments  general economic conditions and potential future merger and acquisition activity 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and anticipated cash flow from existing collaboration agreements will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for at least the next months 
this estimate of our future capital requirements is a forward looking statement that is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
our actual future capital requirements could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the progress of our research activities  the number and scope of our research programs  the progress of our preclinical and potential clinical development activities  the progress of the development efforts of our collaborators  our ability to establish and maintain current and new collaboration agreements  the ability of our collaborators to fund research and development programs  the costs involved in enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  and the costs of establishing business development and distribution capabilities 
future capital requirements will also depend upon the extent to which we acquire or invest in other businesses  products and technologies 
until we can generate sufficient levels of cash from our operations  which we do not expect to achieve in the foreseeable future  we expect to continue to utilize our existing cash and marketable securities resources that were primarily generated from the proceeds of our equity offerings 
in addition  we may finance future cash needs through the sale of equity securities  strategic collaboration agreements and debt financing 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining new or in retaining existing collaboration agreements  or in receiving milestone and or royalty payments under those agreements  that our existing cash and marketable securities resources will be adequate or that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  this financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose  or may adversely affect our ability to operate as an ongoing concern 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
obligations and commitments the following table shows our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts 
payments due as of june  less than year years years after years total in thousands operating lease obligations     we are obligated under noncancelable operating leases for our facilities and certain equipment 
lease terms for our facilities range from five to seven years with renewal options and generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes  insurance  common area and other operating costs 
equipment leases generally range from three to five years 
at june   we had restricted cash of million as a compensating balance to support outstanding standby letters of credit that were issued during the prior fiscal years in relation to our facilities leases 
critical accounting policies we believe the policies identified below are critical to the understanding of our results of operations and require our management to make significant judgments in preparing the financial statements included in this report 
management has made estimates and assumptions based on these policies 
we do not believe that there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported if different assumptions were used 
however  the application of these policies involves judgments and assumptions as to future events and  as a result  actual results could differ 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition we believe our revenue recognition policy is significant because the amount and timing of revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
we follow the guidance of staff accounting bulletin no 
 which requires that a series of criteria be met in order to recognize revenue related to the performance of services or the shipment of products 
if these criteria are not met  the associated revenue is deferred until the criteria are met 
we recognize revenue when a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b products are delivered or services are rendered  c the sales price is fixed or determinable and d collectibility is assured 
we recognize revenue from fees under our collaboration agreements on a monthly basis as research is performed 
development and fixed fee revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
per compound revenue is recognized as compounds are shipped 
revenue from license fees and up front fees is recognized over the term of the license or over the expected term of the collaboration agreement 
royalty revenue is recorded when earned 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue based upon the stage of completion of our performance obligations under the related contract 
in general  contract provisions include predetermined payment schedules or the submission of appropriate billing detail 
any payments received in advance from these agreements are recorded as advanced payments from customers until the revenue is earned 
revenue recognition related to license fees  up front payments and milestone payments could be accelerated in the event of early termination of agreements  or extended over longer periods in the event of extensions to agreements 
inventory valuation our inventories are a significant component of our total assets 
in addition  the value at which we carry our inventory directly impacts our results of operations 
our inventories primarily consist of individual chemical compounds in the form of optimer building blocks  our lead generation libraries  custom libraries and commercially available fine chemicals 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined under the first in  first out method 
we design and produce chemical compounds comprising our lead generation libraries  custom libraries and optimer building blocks and for our proprietary research activities  and begin capitalizing costs into inventory only after technological feasibility has been established 
we review inventories periodically and reduce items considered to be slow moving or obsolete to estimated net realizable value through an appropriate reserve 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and replaces eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf no 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  and require companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan as previously required under eitf no

see note in the notes to financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value  or market value  of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
fin is effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements in fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ended after december  array adopted the new disclosure provisions of fin see note in the notes to financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
the adoption of this interpretation is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
sfas amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  to provide alternative methods of transition to a voluntary change to sfas s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas and apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure of the method of accounting used for stock based compensation and the effects of this method on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
array adopted the new disclosure requirements of sfas during the fiscal year as permitted by sfas  we will continue to apply the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no

in january  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf statement no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf addresses how to determine whether a revenue arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition and how the revenue arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting 
eitf applies to all revenue arrangements that are executed after june  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk short term investments 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of united states interest rates  particularly since a significant portion of our investments are and will be in short term marketable securities 
due to the nature and maturity of our short term investments  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
foreign currency rate fluctuations 
all of our collaboration agreements and purchase orders are denominated in united states dollars 
therefore  we are not exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
inflation 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented
