market background there are three principal types of ics used in most digital electronic systems processors  which generally are utilized for control and computing tasks  memory devices  which are used for storing program instructions and data  and logic devices  which generally are used to manage the interchange and manipulation of digital signals within a system 
almost every electronic system contains application specific integrated circuits asics  which include custom gate arrays  standard cells and programmable logic 
these devices all compete with each other since they may be utilized in the same types of applications within electronic systems 
however  variables in pricing  product performance  reliability  power consumption  density  adaptability  ease of use and time to market determine the degree to which the devices compete for specific applications 
programmable logic has a primary advantage over custom gate arrays and standard cells in that it enables faster time to market with shorter design cycles 
users of plds can program their design directly into the pld  using software  thereby allowing customers to make revisions to their designs relatively quickly and with lower development costs 
since plds are programmable  they typically have a larger die size resulting in higher costs per unit compared to custom gate arrays and standard cells  which are customized with a fixed function during wafer fabrication 
custom gate arrays and standard cells  however  generally require longer fabrication lead times and higher up front costs than plds 
plds are standard components 
this means that the same device type can be sold to many different customers for many different applications 
as a result  the development cost of plds can be spread over a large number of customers 
custom gate arrays and standard cells  on the other hand  are custom chips for an individual customer for use in a specific application 
this involves a high up front cost to customers 
technology advances are enabling pld companies to reduce costs considerably 
this factor makes plds an increasingly attractive alternative to custom gate arrays and standard cells 

table of contents products integral to the future success of our business is the timely introduction of new products that address customer requirements and compete effectively with respect to price  functionality and performance 
software design tools  ip cores  technical support and design services are also critical components that enable our customers to implement their design specifications into our plds 
altogether  these products form a comprehensive programmable logic solution

in software and ip cores  we released new versions of design tools foundation series ise software  as well as embedded software development tools embedded 
table of contents systems development kit edk cores of logic and a system level design environment for high performance dsp system generator for dsp 
we collaborated with our foundry suppliers in the development of and nanometer complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos manufacturing technology and we believe we are one of the first companies in the industry to move aggressively to mm wafer technology for cost reduction 
our research and development challenge is to continue to develop new products that create cost effective solutions for customers 
in fiscal  and  our research and development expenses were million  million and million  respectively 
excluding million  million and million of non cash deferred stock compensation associated with the november acquisition of rocketchips  research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development 
we believe technical leadership is essential to our future success and we are committed to continuing a significant level of research and development effort 
however  there can be no assurance that any of our research and development efforts will be successful  timely or cost effective 
marketing and sales we sell the majority of our products through several franchised domestic and foreign distributors 
we also utilize a direct sales management organization and field applications engineers faes as well as independent sales representative firms 
our independent representatives generally address larger oem customers and act as a direct sales force  while distributors generally provide vendor managed inventory and logistics for large oem customers and also create demand within the balance of our customer base 
our sales and customer support personnel support all channels and consult with customers about their plans in an effort to ensure that the right solution is provided at the beginning of a customer s project 
the memec group memec and avnet  inc avnet distribute our products worldwide 
we also use other regional distributors throughout the world 
from time to time  we may add or terminate distributors  as we deem appropriate given the level of business and their performance 
we believe distributors provide a cost effective means of reaching a broad range of customers while providing efficient logistics services 
since plds are standard products  they do not present many of the inventory risks to distributors posed by custom gate arrays  and they simplify the requirements for distributor technical support 
revenue recognition on shipments to distributors worldwide is deferred until the products are sold to the end customer 
distributors have certain rights of return and price protection privileges on unsold product
