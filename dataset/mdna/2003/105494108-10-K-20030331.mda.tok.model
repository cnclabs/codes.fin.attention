item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview we are a non diversified investment company that is regulated as a business development company under the investment company act of we provide equity and long term debt financing to small and medium sized private companies in a variety of industries throughout the united states 
our investment objective is to achieve long term capital appreciation in the value of our investments and to provide current income primarily from interest  dividends and fees paid by our portfolio companies 
historically  we have focused our investing activities on private equity securities 
we generally structure our private equity investments as participating preferred stock with an to dividend yield that accumulates and is paid upon a liquidity event 
our private equity investments typically range from million to million  and we generally expect these investments to achieve liquidity within three to five years 
we typically do not receive a cash return on our private equity investments until a liquidity event occurs  but instead seek to achieve long term capital appreciation in net asset value through such investments 
on march   we entered into a memorandum of understanding with phillip goldstein  a director of the company  pursuant to which mr 
goldstein agreed to dismiss the lawsuit he filed against us in september  subject to compliance with the investment company act of see item legal proceedings

hellerman resigns or is unable to serve that a representative of mr 
goldstein s choosing will be appointed to the board  to pursue a plan to orderly dispose of assets and distribute proceeds to stockholders  or  in the alternative  to pursue a merger or a sale of assets of the company  that mr 
goldstein will not engage in a proxy contest against the company  to enter into a new investment advisory agreement that would reduce the fee payable to our adviser from of our net assets to entitle our adviser to receive a fee of of the proceeds distributed to stockholders in excess of per share  provided that none of this amount shall be paid until distributions of at least per share have been made  to terminate all currently outstanding stock options and not to grant any further stock options

see investment adviser and investment advisory agreement 
critical accounting policies and estimates privately placed equity and mezzanine securities are carried at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors 
initially  the fair value of each such security is based upon its original cost 
cost is also the primary factor used to determine fair value on an ongoing basis until significant developments or other factors affecting the investment such as results of subsequent financings  the availability of market quotations  the portfolio company s operations and changes in general market conditions provide a basis for value other than cost 
portfolio investments listed on a securities exchange or traded on the nasdaq stock market are valued at the closing price listed on the relevant exchange or quotation system on the date of valuation 
securities traded in the over the counter market are valued based on the average of the closing bid and asked prices on the date of valuation 
interest income is recorded on mezzanine investments when the payment is contractually due unless a loan is more than days past due 
interest is not accrued on any loans that are more than days past due 
dividend income is recorded on cumulative preferred equity securities on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected and on common equity securities on the record date for private companies or on the ex dividend date for publicly traded companies 
we assess the collectibility of dividends and interest income receivables in connection with our determination of the fair value of the related security 
to the extent that their are adverse future developments  previously recognized dividend and interest income may not be realized 
we account for our operations utilizing accounting principles generally accepted in the united states for investment companies 
on this basis  the principal measure of our financial performance is captioned net change in net assets resulting from operations  which is the sum of two elements 
the first element is investment income loss  net  which is the difference between our income from interest  dividends and fees  and our operating expenses 
the second element is net gain loss on investments  which is the sum of the difference between the proceeds received from our dispositions of portfolio securities and their stated cost net realized gain loss on investments  and the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio net unrealized gain loss on investments 
net realized gain loss on investments and net unrealized gain loss on investments are directly related 
for example  in the period during which a security is sold to realize a gain  net unrealized gain on investments decreases  and net realized gain on investments increases 
historically  we have focused our investing activities on private equity securities 
we began making such investments in and are now entering into a phase of the business plan which emphasizes positioning our more mature portfolio companies for appropriate liquidity events 
as a result  we are continuously monitoring portfolio company results and evaluating opportunities to maximize the valuation of our investments

any such transaction could have an impact on the valuation of our investments
