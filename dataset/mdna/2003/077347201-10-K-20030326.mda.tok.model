item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto 
the discussion of results  causes and trends should not be construed to infer any conclusion that such results  causes or trends will necessarily continue in the future 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  investments  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company makes purchasing decisions principally based upon firm sales orders from customers  the availability and pricing of raw materials and projected customer requirements 
future events that could adversely affect these decisions and result in significant charges to the company s operations include slow down in customer demand as the company is currently experiencing  customers delaying the issuance of sales orders to the company  miscalculating customer requirements  technology changes which render the raw materials and finished goods obsolete  and cancellation or loss of customers and or cancellation of sales orders 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon the aforementioned assumptions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company seeks sales and profit growth by expanding its existing customer base  developing new products and by pursuing strategic acquisitions that meet the company s criteria relating to the market for the products the company s ability to efficiently manufacture the product  synergies that are created by the acquisition  and a purchase price that represents fair value 
if the company s evaluation of a target company misjudges its technology  estimated future sales and profitability levels  or ability to keep pace with the latest technology  these factors could impair the value of the investment  which could materially adversely affect the company s profitability
