item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the primary business of the company is the ownership of the bank 
the company s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the company also generates noninterest income such as income from real estate development activities and service fees 
noninterest expense consists of employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment expense  and other operating expenses 
the company s results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies  and actions of regulatory agencies 
safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of this report contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the company intends such forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the private securities reform act of  as amended  and is including this statement for purposes of these safe harbor provisions 
forward looking statements  which are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans  strategies and expectations of the company  are generally identifiable by use of the words believe  expect  intend  anticipate  estimate  project  or similar expressions 
the company s ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain 
factors that could have a material adverse effect on the operations and future prospects of the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries include  but are not limited to  changes in interest rates  the economic health of the local real estate market  general economic conditions  legislative regulatory provisions  monetary and fiscal policies of the us government  including policies of the us treasury and the federal reserve board  the quality or composition of the loan and securities portfolios  demand for loan products  deposit flows  competition  demand for financial services in the company s market area  and accounting principles  policies  and guidelines 
these risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements 
average statement of financial condition the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s average statement of financial condition and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the years ended december    and the yields and costs are derived by dividing interest income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the years shown 
average balances are derived from average month end balances 
management does not believe that the use of average monthly balances instead of average daily balances has caused any material differences in the information presented 
average balances of loans receivable include loans on which the bank has discontinued accruing interest 
loan yields include fees that are considered adjustments to yields

net interest rate spread represents the difference between the yield on average interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
rate volume analysis the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected interest income and interest expense during the years indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to i changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes attributable to changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume  and iii the net change 
the changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate

cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million at december   primarily as a result of loan demand during during  loans increased by million to million  primarily as a result of the purchase of million of loan participations in in addition  the continued low level of market rates of interest resulted in high volumes of loan originations and refinancings 
the allowance for loan losses was  and  at december  and  respectively 
there were no impaired loans at either date 
nonaccrual loans were  at december  compared to  at the prior year end 
losses  if any  on nonaccrual loans are not expected to be significant 
during  loans totaling  were charged off  no loans were charged off in total liabilities at december  were million compared to million at december   an increase of million 
deposits increased  primarily due to interest crediting 
in addition  the company increased federal home loan bank advances by million to fund the increased loan demand experienced during stockholders equity at december  was million compared to million at december   an increase of million  primarily due to net income of million  the increase in fair value of securities classified as available for sale of  net of deferred taxes 
these increases were offset by the purchase of  shares of treasury stock for  and cash dividends of  comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and general net income increased to million in from million in the increase is primarily due to increases in the company s net interest income and noninterest income  partially offset by increases in noninterest expense  which is more fully discussed below 
net interest income interest income in was million compared to million in  a decrease of 
the decrease in interest income was primarily due to a decrease of million in the average balance of securities and mortgage backed securities due to calls and maturities  offset by an increase in the average balance of loans receivable of million 
in addition  there was a basis point decrease in the average yield on earning assets due to a decreasing rate environment  which resulted in refinancings of mortgage loans at lower rates and repayment of mortgage backed securities 
interest expense in was million compared to million in  a decrease of 
the decrease in interest expense is due to a decrease in the average rate paid on deposits and borrowings of basis points 
at december   the company had million  or  of certificates of deposit scheduled to mature during the majority of these certificates of deposit were renewed at lower rates throughout the year 
net interest income in was million compared to million in  an increase of 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in the net interest rate spread to in from in and an increase in the net interest margin to in from in provision for loan losses management establishes provisions for loan losses  which are charged to operations  at a level management believes is appropriate to absorb probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio 
in evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses  management considers historical loss experience  the types of loans and the amount of loans in the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  peer group information  and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events change 
there was a  provision for losses on loans provided in and no provision was provided in the increased provision for loan losses is reflective of the increase in net charge offs to  in compared to none in prior year 
in addition  nonperforming loans increased to  at december   from  at december  management believes that its assessment of the allowance for loan losses is adequate  given the trends in loan delinquencies and historical loss experience of the portfolio and current economic conditions 
management assesses the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and makes provisions for loan losses as necessary in order to maintain the adequacy of the allowance 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future loan loss provisions may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize additional provisions based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
the allowance for loan losses as of december  is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of inherent losses in the loan portfolio  and such losses were both probable and reasonably estimable 
noninterest income noninterest income in was million compared to  in the increase was primarily attributable to  of income generated from bank owned life insurance 
in addition  the company realized net gains on the sale of securities of  in compared to  in the company sold real estate held for expansion during with a resultant gain of noninterest expense noninterest expense in was million compared to million in the increase was primarily a result of occupancy and equipment expenses increased due to depreciation expense associated with hardware and software upgrades and capital expenditures 
income taxes income tax expense was million in compared to  in the increase in income tax expense was primarily due to an increase in pre tax income in the effective tax rate was for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily a result of an increase in tax exempt income related to the cash surrender value of life insurance 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and general net income remained at million for both and this is primarily due to increases in the company s net interest income  partially offset by increases in noninterest expense  which is more fully discussed below 
net interest income interest income in was million compared to million in the increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of loans receivable of million  partially offset by a million decrease in the average balance of securities and mortgage backed securities due to calls and maturities

there was no provision for losses on loans in and the lack of provision is indicative of management s assessment that the allowance for loan losses is adequate  given the trends in loan delinquencies and historical loss experience of the portfolio and current economic conditions

the allowance for loan losses as of december  is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of inherent losses in the loan portfolio  and such losses were both probable and reasonably estimable 
noninterest income noninterest income in was  compared to  in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in service fee income as a result of an increase in the average balance of deposits 
in addition  the company realized net gains on the sale of securities of  in compared to  in this was partially offset by gains of  on real estate held for development in compared to gains of  in the company completed the sale of lots in the two real estate development projects during although management continues to seek opportunities for new real estate development projects  there can be no assurance that any new projects will be entered into during noninterest expense noninterest expense in was million compared to million in  an increase of 
the increase was primarily a result of increased compensation and benefits of  due to normal cost of living adjustments and increased health insurance costs 
legal fees also increased by approximately  as a result of fees associated with the repurchase of shares of company stock from two large stockholders and regulatory filings 
in addition  data processing fees increased due to yearly contractual escalations 
occupancy and equipment expenses increased due to depreciation expense associated with hardware and software upgrades and capital expenditures throughout income taxes income tax expense was  in compared to  in the increase in income tax expense was due to an increase in pre tax income in federal income tax expense was approximately of pre tax income for both years 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  principal and interest payments on loans and securities  proceeds from maturities and calls of securities  fhlb advances  and securities sold under repurchase agreements 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
the bank maintains a liquidity ratio substantially above the regulatory requirement 
this requirement  which may be varied at the direction of the ots depending upon economic conditions and deposit flows  is based upon a percentage of deposits and short term borrowings 
the required ratio is currently 
the bank s average regulatory liquidity ratios were   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the company s cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications cash flows from operating activities  investing activities  and financing activities 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
net cash from investing activities consisted primarily of disbursements for loan originations and the purchase of securities  offset by principal collections on loans  proceeds from maturing securities and paydowns on mortgage backed securities  and the investment in and proceeds from the sale of real estate held for development 
net cash from financing activities consisted primarily of the activity in deposit accounts  fhlb borrowings  and securities sold under repurchase agreements in addition to the purchase of treasury stock 
the net cash from financing activities was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
at december   the bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements with a tier core capital level of million  or of adjusted total assets  which is above the required level of million  or  and total risk based capital of million  or of risk weighted assets  which is above the required level of million  or 
the bank s most liquid assets are cash and short term investments 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the bank s operating  financing  lending  and investing activities during any given period 
at december   cash and short term investments totaled million 
the bank has other sources of liquidity if a need for additional funds arises  including the repayment of loans and mortgage backed securities 
the bank may also utilize fhlb advances or the sale of securities available for sale as a source of funds 
at december   the bank had outstanding commitments to originate mortgage loans of million  as compared to million in the bank anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan origination commitments 
certificate accounts that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from december  totaled million 
management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing certificate accounts will be renewed at the bank 
however  if these deposits are not retained  the bank may utilize fhlb advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts  which may result in higher levels of interest expense 
subsequent to december   the company entered into a million contract to reconstruct the th street branch office 
the following tables disclose contractual obligations and commercial commitments of the company as of december  less than after total year years years years securities sold under agreements to repurchase    fhlb advances      total contractual cash obligations      total amounts less than over committed year years years years standby letters of credit  loans in process   loan commitments   total commitments   impact of inflation and changing prices the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the bank s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of a model that estimates the change in net portfolio value npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
an npv ratio  in any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the sensitivity measure is the decline in the npv ratio  in basis points  caused by a increase or decrease in rates  whichever produces a larger decline 
the higher an institution s sensitivity measure is  the greater its exposure to interest rate risk is considered to be 
the ots has incorporated an interest rate risk component into its regulatory capital rule 
under the rule  an institution whose sensitivity measure exceeds would be required to deduct an interest rate risk component in calculating its total capital for purposes of the risk based capital requirement 
as of december   the bank s sensitivity measure  as measured by the ots  resulting from a basis point increase in interest rates was and would result in a million decrease in the npv of the bank 
accordingly  increases in interest rates would be expected to have a negative impact on the bank s operating results 
the npv ratio sensitivity measure is below the threshold at which the bank could be required to hold additional risk based capital under ots regulations 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv require the making of certain assumptions that may tend to oversimplify the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
first  the models assume that the composition of the bank s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remain constant over the period being measured 
second  the models assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
third  the model does not take into account the impact of the bank s business or strategic plans on the structure of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv measurement provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
the results of this modeling are monitored by management and presented to the board of directors quarterly 
the following tables show the npv and projected change in the npv of the bank at december  and assuming an instantaneous and sustained change in market interest rates of   and basis points 
interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value npv december  npv as a of net portfolio value pv of assets change in rates amount change change npv ratio change bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp  bp  bp bp n a n a n a n a n a bp n a n a n a n a n a december  npv as a of net portfolio value pv of assets change in rates amount change change npv ratio change bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp  bp   bp bp n a n a n a n a n a bp n a n a n a n a n a on december  and  the yield on the three month treasury bill was below 
as a result  the net portfolio value analysis was unable to produce results for the minus and minus basis point scenarios 
the bank and the company do not maintain any securities for trading purposes 
the bank and the company do not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments in a material amount to control interest rate risk 
in addition  interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the bank and the company 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities and operations
