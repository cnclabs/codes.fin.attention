during the fiscal year ended june   total assets decreased by  from  at june  to  at june  the majority of the decrease was in short term deposits as a result of payments on lines of credit  notes payable  capital lease obligations  accounts payable 
accounts receivable have decreased due to faster collection of debt from customers

table of contents the following table sets forth our revenue components for the past three years revenue components year ended june  june  june  net sales testing manufacturing distribution total geographically  we operate in the us  singapore  malaysia  thailand  and ireland 
our customers are mainly concentrated in southeast asia and they are either semiconductor chip manufacturers or testing facilities that purchase our testing equipment 
our cost of sales is made up of the cost of inventories  labor  depreciation  utilities which is a major component of costs for testing services  and overhead relating to manufacturing  testing and distribution segments 
our operating expenses can be classified into three general categories selling expense  general and administrative expense  and research and development expense 
selling expenses include expenses  such as sales commissions  payroll and payroll taxes for employees working in the selling department  advertising  utilities and other expenses directly related to selling activities 
general and administrative expenses include management payroll  property taxes  rental expense  depreciation of fixed assets used by the management function  utilities  employee fringe benefits  office supplies  travel and entertainment  professional expense  outside services and other expenses related to management and administration processes 
research and development expenses include payroll and payroll tax  travel  and any other expenses that are directly related to research activities 
critical accounting policies in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policy  the company identified the most critical accounting principles upon which its financial status depends 
the company determined that those critical accounting principles are related to the use of estimates  inventory valuation  revenue recognition  income tax and impairment of intangibles and other long lived assets 
the company states these accounting policies in the relevant sections in this management s discussion and analysis  including the recently issued accounting pronouncements discussed below 
use of estimates the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and judgments that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company regularly evaluates these estimates  including those related to inventory valuation  revenue recognition and income taxes 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed by management to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the most important estimates included in the financial statements are the allowance for doubtful accounts  provision for inventory obsolescence  the estimated useful life of long lived assets  and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates  which may impact the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
inventory valuation we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we write down inventories for unsalable  excess or obsolete raw materials  work in process and finished goods by charging such write downs to cost of sales 
in addition to write downs based on newly introduced parts  statistical and judgmental assessments are calculated for the remaining inventory based on salability and obsolescence 
revenue recognition the company has three business segments manufacturing  distribution  and testing services 
in the manufacturing segment  the products manufactured are mainly back end products that require installation work and certain minor training work in the field with the customer s employees  depending on whether the machine or equipment is standardized or customized 
the value of this type of arrangement varies depending on the quantity of equipment ordered by the customer and on the complexity of the equipment set 
in general  the common practice is to recognize revenue upon shipment of the 
table of contents product  provided that both title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  collection is reasonably assured and the customer has accepted the shipment in terms of any customer acceptance provisions 
in general  the sales contracts are written such that they may list separate installation including training and upgrades as a separate line item 
not all machinery and equipment manufactured requires installation work 
in the case where installation is required we allocate a portion of the invoice value to the machine and the remaining portion to the value of the installation work to be performed  based on the relative fair value of the elements 
the revenue allocated to installation and training is recognized upon completion of the installation and training services 
the allocation of value between the machinery and the installation and training work is based on our specific historical experience of the relative fair values of the elements 
such allocation is a critical accounting estimate for our revenue recognition purposes 
in the distribution segment  the products distributed are front end and back end products that may require certain installation work 
in general  the common practice is to recognize revenue upon shipment of the distributed product  provided that both title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  and collection is reasonably assured and the customer has accepted the shipment in terms of any customer acceptance provisions 
in those cases where installation is required  the installation work in the distribution segment is normally less than hours of our technician labor 
similar to those in the manufacturing segment  our sales contracts are written so that they may either list separate installation including training and upgrades as a separate line item 
in addition  most front end products which account for approximately of the total revenue in the distribution segment for fiscal and do not require installation work 
in the case where installation is required  we allocate a portion of the invoice value to the distributed product and the remaining portion to the value of the installation work to be performed  based on the relative fair value of the elements 
the revenue allocated to installation and training is recognized upon completion of the installation and training services 
the allocation of value between the distributed products and the installation and training work is based on our specific historical experience of the relative fair values of the elements 
such allocation is a critical accounting estimate for our revenue recognition purposes 
the company estimates an allowance for sales returns based on historical experience with product returns 
regarding the testing segment  revenue is recognized when testing services have been rendered 
income tax we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no  accounting for income taxes sfas no 

sfas no 
requires an entity to recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequence attributable to the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date 
our foreign subsidiaries are subject to income taxes in the regions where they operate 
because of the different income tax jurisdictions  net losses generated in the us cannot be utilized to offset the taxable income generated in foreign countries 
therefore  we may incur certain income tax expenses in any fiscal year 
for us income tax purposes  no provision has been made for us taxes on undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries  with which the company intends to continue to reinvest 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on the foreign earnings if they were remitted as dividends  were lent to the company  or if the company should sell its stock in the subsidiary 
however  the company believes that us foreign tax credits and net operating losses available would substantially eliminate any additional tax effects 
impairment of long lived assets effective july   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
whenever any such impairment exists  an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  sales net sales for the company increased by  or from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  due to the recovery of semiconductor sales  such as wireless and digital consumer products 
the semiconductor industry association sia expects 
table of contents the growth rate for these products to be approximately in fiscal and in fiscal the testing operation in bangkok and sales of low margin products in the distribution segment mainly contributed to this increase in net sales 
the sales in the manufacturing segment decreased by or from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease was attributed mainly to operations in the united states  which we believe were affected by the conservative capital spending by customers 
the decrease in demand resulted in a decrease in sales of approximately for artic temperature controlled chucks  a decrease in the number of units sold combined with an decrease in the average selling price  and related to the decrease in sales for environmental test equipment  a decrease in the number of units sold combined with a decrease in the average selling price 
however  the decrease in sales was offset by a increase from the sale of burn in equipment as a result of an increase in the average selling price of the units without a material effect on the number of units sold 
the types of products we manufacture cover a broad range  resulting in a wide range of prices our selling price of our products range from to 
revenue in the manufacturing segment depends heavily on customers specific demands which correlate to their capital budgets 
net sales in testing services segment increased by or from  in fiscal to  in fiscal of such increase  was attributable to our thailand operation because of new contracts secured from existing customers and new customers 
there was an increase in activities for the thailand operation without material effect on the average selling price 
the remaining increase was attributable to our singapore operation with an increase in activities which had an immaterial effect on the average selling price 
of the increase of  approximately of revenue in thailand was attributable to a customer who moved their production from malaysia to its facility in thailand 
revenue from this particular customer decreased in fiscal  in anticipation of their relocation from malaysia to thailand 
the sales in the distribution segment increased by  or from  in fiscal to  in fiscal of such increase   represented a increase in the average selling price with prices ranging from to  despite a decrease in the number of units sold for low margin products 
furthermore  of such increase was due to the increase in demand for test chambers and vibration products with selling prices ranging from to revenue in the distribution segment depends heavily on customers specific demands  which correlate to their capital budgets 
geographically  net sales into and within the united states increased by or from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  which related mainly to the distribution segment 
the increase of was attributable primarily to an increased demand in the us for front end low margin products from the distribution segment in singapore 
net sales within southeast asia increased  or from  in fiscal to  in fiscal of the increase of  was primarily related to new burn in testing services in the thailand operation 
furthermore  of the increase was due to an increase in demand for burn in equipments and boards  which related to the manufacturing segment in singapore 
net sales in europe decreased by or from  in fiscal to in fiscal  of which was attributed to the manufacturing segment and was primarily due to a decline in demand for testing services  which occurred when several large customers moved out of europe 
cost of sales the company s cost of sales increased by or from  in fiscal to  in fiscal of the increase of  the majority was related to an increase in material costs of  which is consistent with the increase in sales  offset by the reduction in net payroll costs of and overheads of from the manufacturing segment 
however  as a percentage of sales  the cost of sales decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease in cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  was due primarily to the inventory obsolescence of recorded in fiscal which did not recur in fiscal  and lower depreciation expenses of incurred due to the impairment loss of fixed assets recorded in fiscal year which did not recur in fiscal along with cost cutting measures being adopted in the us operations  the effect of reducing payroll related expense in singapore by in fiscal also contributed to the decrease of cost of sales as a percentage of revenue 
operating expenses operating expenses decreased by  or from  in fiscal to  in fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  our operating expenses in fiscal decreased from in fiscal to 
the major reduction in operating expenses was attributable to a reduction in impairment loss of  a reduction of in net payroll related expense  a reduction of in research and development  a reduction of in selling expenses related to commission and warranty expense  and a reduction of in other costs 
general and administrative general and administrative g a expenses decreased by or from  in fiscal to  in fiscal as a percentage of sales  g a decreased by from in to in fiscal although we had a 
table of contents decrease in g a during fiscal as a result of a decrease in payroll related expenses  primarily in the us operations  such decrease was offset by increase in payroll expenses in southeast asia as operations increased based on increased sales 
in addition  we had a decrease in rental  relocation  and insurance expense due to relocation to smaller facilities in van nuys  california  and a decrease in depreciation expense due to the impairment loss of assets recorded in fiscal selling selling expenses decreased by or from  in fiscal to in fiscal as a percentage of sales  selling expenses decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal of the  was related to a decrease in commission expense as a result of a decrease in commission related sales in the distribution and manufacturing segments  was related to a decrease in warranty expense incurred in southeast asia reflecting the fact that the products sold that require warranty were reduced in fiscal  a decrease was due to an impairment loss recorded in fiscal  which did not recur in fiscal  an approximate decrease in travel and related costs was due to fewer sales trips made in the second half of fiscal as a result of the iraq war and the sars outbreak in asia  and a decrease in other expense items was a result of cost cutting measures implemented during fiscal research and development research and development expense decreased by or from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease was due primarily to management s decision to reduce research and development activities on its automated wet benches and artic temperature controlled chucks  based on reduced demand for these customized products in the manufacturing segment 
impairment loss impairment loss decreased by  or  from  in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease of  was primarily due to the remaining fixed and intangible assets written to their fair value in fiscal  which was not written down previously 
the company recorded an impairment loss based on its examination of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by the subsidiaries where certain long lived assets certain fixed assets are used 
the impairment loss of in fiscal consisted of machinery and equipment  furniture and fixtures  and leasehold improvements pertaining to the malaysia and singapore testing segments due to changes in demand for certain burn in services which in turn made certain of our existing burn in facilities obsolete 
gain loss on sale of property  plant and equipment the result of disposing of property  plant and equipment decreased by from a gain of in fiscal to a loss of in fiscal the disposal loss was related to the disposal of the obsolete burn in facilities in southeast asia due to the development and advancement in technology 
income loss from operations for segment reporting purposes  the loss from operations in our manufacturing segment was reduced by  from  in fiscal to in fiscal  due to a reduction of  in impairment loss of machinery and equipment recorded in fiscal  a reduction of depreciation expense in as a result of impairment charge recorded in fiscal which did not recur in fiscal  a reduction of in payroll related expense as a result of implementing cost cutting measures in fiscal  and a reduction of in cost of sales in the us operations consistent with the decrease in revenue  an inventory obsolescence of recorded in fiscal not recurring in fiscal  a reduction in research and development costs of due to a change in demand for products sold by our manufacturing segment  and reducing rent  insurance  travel and other miscellaneous expenses by income from operations in our testing services segment increased by or from in fiscal to in fiscal due to a reduction in impairment loss of in fiscal which consisted of machinery and equipment  furniture and fixtures  and leasehold improvements pertaining to the malaysia and singapore testing segments  and lower depreciation of due to machinery and equipment disposed of during fiscal compared to a loss of in fiscal these were offset by higher losses of incurred in ireland in fiscal compared to a loss of in fiscal loss from operations in our distribution segment increased by from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase of in loss from operations resulted primarily from the increase in products sold with low margins 
due to the fierce competition in the capital equipment market and the decrease in customers capital spending budgets  customers took advantage of price reductions to obtain necessary equipment  which  although increasing our revenue  reduced our margins 
because the prices of products distributed by us range widely from to  the increase in sales volume was not sufficient in fiscal to offset the effects of the price reduction 

table of contents corporate operating loss decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to an increase in the allocation percentage being charged to our subsidiaries based on sale volume  which increased corporate income by interest expenses interest expense decreased by or from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to net repayments of on the line of credit and payments of  on long term debt and capitalized leases 
other income expense other income increased by or from in fiscal to in fiscal changes in other income in fiscal compared to that in fiscal consist of mainly of an increase in gain on disposal of marketable securities of  increase in exchange gain of in fiscal and  a decrease in interest income of in fiscal income tax the total income tax provision increased by or from in fiscal to in fiscal of the change of  was related to the current portion of income tax due to the increase of in foreign income tax expense and in state income tax expense compared to those in fiscal the remaining related to the deferred portion of income taxes expense 
the increase of in current foreign income tax expense was a result of an increase in income in thailand from a loss of in fiscal to an income of in fiscal  which was offset by the decrease in income in singapore of in fiscal to in fiscal though singapore had a higher income in fiscal  the allowance on depreciation for tax purposes reduced the taxable income and thus resulted in lower tax provision in fiscal the deferred portion of income tax provision increased by from in fiscal to in fiscal  which was attributed in the increase in the deferred tax liability incurred mainly in singapore 
the increase in deferred income tax expense was the result of the timing differences related to the recording of depreciation expense for book and tax purposes 
we did not recognize any income tax benefits related to the losses generated in the us we believe that when the future taxable income exceeds the cumulative losses  it is likely that such benefits will be realized 
the company s effective income tax rate increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal was due to the decrease in net loss generated in the us and the increase in the net income before taxes generated by the operations conducted in foreign countries 
in addition  the net loss incurred in the us cannot offset the taxable income in singapore and thailand 
therefore  the main portion of income tax expense of was incurred in singapore and thailand 
the company files income tax returns in the us  singapore  thailand  malaysia  and ireland  respectively 
income taxes are provided in those countries where taxable income is earned 
income in one country is not offset by losses in another country 
accordingly  no benefit is provided for losses in the countries except where the loss can be carried back against income recognized in previous years 
the effect of providing tax against taxable income while not providing benefit for losses results in an effective tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate 
the nature and terms of income tax holidays  abatements  rate reductions and similar arrangements granted by foreign taxing authorities and their impact on the provision for income taxes are as follows capital allowances are available in the southeast asia operations to offset taxable income  which is the same as accelerated allowance on fixed assets 
this reduces the income tax payable and creates deferred tax liabilities for the next few years 
reinvestment allowances can only offset the tax payable if the expansion  modernization or diversification is carried out in a promoted area 
net loss income as a result of all of the factors analyzed above  the net loss for the fiscal year ended june  was approximately  which represented a decrease in losses of  from a net loss of  for fiscal  or a change 
basic loss per share for fiscal decreased to per share  from a basic loss per share of in fiscal  which represented a decrease of  a change 
diluted loss per share for fiscal was per share  a decrease of per share from diluted loss per share of for fiscal 
table of contents year ended june  compared to year ended june  sales net sales decreased by  or from  in fiscal to  in fiscal due to a worldwide decline in semiconductor equipment sales  which was projected by the semiconductor equipment and materials international semi to decline by in fiscal semi also reported recently that worldwide sales of semiconductor manufacturing equipment totaled billion in fiscal  a year over year decline  and the worst drop in sales on record 
the chip making tool market is projected to rebound and increase by in fiscal and in fiscal the sales in manufacturing segment decreased by  or from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease was attributed to operations in the united states and singapore  which were affected by conservative capital spending by customers 
the decrease in demand resulted in a decrease in sales of approximately   and  related to the decrease in sales for front end products such as artic temperature controlled chucks and wet process benches  back end products such as environmental test equipment and burn in equipment and boards  and other products  respectively 
the types of products we manufacture cover a broad range  resulting in a wide range of prices our selling price of our products range from to 
consequently  the impact of changes in prices of the products sold on our revenue did not reflect the changes in manufacturing segment business because the movement of revenue in the manufacturing segment depends heavily on customers specific demands which correlate to their capital budgets 
the testing services segment sales decreased by  or from  in fiscal to  in fiscal of this decrease of   was attributed to the operation in malaysia  as several large customers moved from malaysia to other parts of southeast asia

was related to a decrease in material costs of and net payroll costs of in the testing service segment 
as a percentage of sales  the cost of sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal mainly due to an inventory write down of attributed from the us operations 
the future impact on the future gross margins for the slow moving obsolete nature of this inventory cannot be readily identified at this time  and the price at which these items can be sold is not known until a buyer can be identified 
operating expenses operating expenses decreased by or from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease of in expenses is attributed to cost cutting measures implemented company wide in late fiscal  which reduced headcount and related expenses by  and a reduction in selling expenses of in commissions and warranty provisions  less traveling during fiscal after the incident  resulting in a reduction in traveling costs of  legal fees of incurred in fiscal to review the acquisition of a company  which did not occur in  and an increase of in other expenses 
these were offset by an impairment loss on goodwill  intangibles and assets of  provided in fiscal  from the manufacturing segment in the us operations and the testing service segment in southeast asia

management s belief is based  in part  on the following we have a fixed cash deposit of approximately million of which approximately million is available immediately  we had backlog of million as of june   our accounts receivable turnover ratio is approximately times per year days of sales in accounts receivable in fiscal  our financing facilities available as of june  were approximately million upon which we are able to draw at any time  and our efforts in fiscal to cut costs and expenses were effective 
these cost cutting measures were implemented through shortened work weeks  salary reductions and a freeze in headcount  reducing and consolidating the plant capacity in order to reduce variable costs  reducing insurance  travel and other miscellaneous expenses 
we anticipate that the costs and expenses in fiscal will be lower than those in fiscal and  accordingly  cash disbursement needs should be lower also 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that costs and expenses in fiscal or thereafter will not be higher than those in fiscal the following contractual obligations servicing table describes our overall future cash obligations based on various contracts in the next five years payments due by period less than more than total year years years years lines of credit notes payable capital leases operating leases

certain risks that may affect our future results we hereby caution stockholders  prospective investors in trio tech international and other readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  our stock price or cause our actual results for the fiscal year ending june  and future fiscal years and quarters to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements  oral or written  made by or on behalf of us 
our operating results are affected by a variety of factors our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially affect revenues and profitability or lead to significant variability of quarterly or annual operating results 
these factors include  among others  components relating to economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry  market acceptance of our products and services  changes in technologies in the semiconductor industry  which could affect demand for our products and services  changes in testing processes  the impact of competition  the lack of long term purchase or supply agreements with customers and vendors  changes in military or commercial testing specifications  which could affect the market for our products and services  difficulties in profitably integrating acquired businesses  if any  into the company  the loss of key personnel or the shortage of available skilled employees  
table of contents international political or economic events  currency fluctuations  and other technological  economic  financial and regulatory factors beyond our control 
unfavorable changes in these or other factors could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
we may not be able to generate revenue growth and any revenue growth that is achieved may not be sustained 
our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected if operating expenses increase and are not subsequently followed by increased revenues 
the semiconductor industry cycles have a large effect on our business our business depends primarily upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  assemblers and other testing companies worldwide 
these industries depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products utilizing semiconductor devices 
the global semiconductor industry generally  and the semiconductor testing equipment industry in particular  are volatile and cyclical  with periodic capacity shortages and excess capacity 
in periods of excess capacity  the industry sharply cuts its purchases of capital equipment  including our distributed products  and reduces testing volumes  including our testing services 
excess capacity also causes downward pressure on the selling prices of our products and services 
our operating results have been adversely affected by past downturns and slowdowns 
there is no assurance that there will not be downturns or slowdowns in the future that may adversely affect our financial condition or operating results 
in addition  if one or more of our primary customers reduces its or their purchases or use of our products or testing services  our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
we anticipate that we will continue to be primarily dependent on the semiconductor industry for the foreseeable future 
rapid technological changes may make our products obsolete or result in decreased prices or increased expenses technology changes rapidly in the semiconductor industry and may make our services or products obsolete 
advances in technology may lead to significant price erosion for products tested with our older testing technologies 
our success will depend in part on our ability to develop and offer more advanced testing technologies and processes in the future  to anticipate both future demand and the technology to supply that demand  to enhance our current products and services  to provide those products and services at competitive prices on a timely and cost effective basis and to achieve market acceptance of those products and services 
to accomplish these goals  we may be required to incur significant engineering expenses 
as new products or services are introduced  we may experience warranty claims or product returns 
we may not be able to accomplish these goals correctly or timely enough 
if we fail in our efforts  our products and services may become obsolete or less competitive 
our dependence on international sales involves significant risk sales and services to customers outside the united states accounted for approximately  and of our net revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
approximately  and of our net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively  were generated from business in southeast asia 
we expect that our non us sales and services will continue to generate the major part of our future revenues 
testing services in southeast asia were performed primarily for american companies  and to a lesser extent german companies  selling products and doing business in those regions 
international business operations may be adversely affected by many factors including fluctuations in exchange rates  imposition of government controls  trade restrictions  political  economic and business events and social and cultural differences 
we may incur losses due to foreign currency fluctuations significant portions of our revenues are denominated in singapore dollars  malaysian ringgit  thai baht and other currencies 
consequently  a portion of our costs  revenues and operating margins may be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates  primarily between the us dollar and such foreign currencies 
we are also affected by fluctuations in exchange rates if there is a mismatch between our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
foreign currency translation adjustments resulted in an increase of to shareholders equity for fiscal  an increase of to shareholders equity for fiscal and a decrease of to shareholders equity for fiscal we try to reduce our risk of foreign currency fluctuations by purchasing certain equipment and supplies in us dollars and seeking payment  when possible  in us dollars 
however  we may not be successful in our attempts to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations 
those fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 

table of contents we do not rely on patents to protect our products or technology we hold us patents relating to our pressurization humidity testing equipment and certain aspects of our artic temperature test systems 
additionally  in fiscal  we were granted patents for certain aspects of our new ranges of artic temperature controlled chucks 
however  generally we do not rely on patent or trade secret protection for our products or technology 
competitors may develop technologies similar to or more advanced than ours 
we cannot assure you that our current or future products will not be copied or will not infringe on the patents of others 
moreover  the cost of litigation of any claim or damages resulting from infringement of patents or other intellectual property could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
intense competition can adversely affect our operating results the semiconductor equipment and testing industries are intensely competitive 
significant competitive factors include price  technical capabilities  quality  automation  reliability  product availability and customer service 
we face competition from established and potential new competitors  many of whom have greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than our company s resources 
new products or testing facilities offered by our competitors could cause a decline in our revenues or a loss of market acceptance of our existing products and services 
increased competitive pressure could also lead to intensified price based competition 
price based competition may result in lower prices  adversely affecting our operating results 
loss  reduction or delay of orders from significant customers could adversely affect our financial condition the semiconductor manufacturing industry is highly concentrated  with a relatively small number of large manufacturers and assemblers accounting for a substantial portion of our revenues from product sales and testing revenues 
our experience has been that sales to particular customers may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year 
in fiscal   and  sales of equipment and services to our two largest customers accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our net revenues 
our ability to maintain close  satisfactory relationships with our customers is essential to our stability and growth 
the loss of or reduction or delay in orders from our significant customers  or delays in collecting accounts receivable from our significant customers  could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
there is a limited market for our testing products and services if testing equipment is purchased by semiconductor manufacturers and assemblers  it may reduce the likelihood that they will make further purchases of such equipment  or use our laboratories for testing services 
although military or other specifications require certain testing to be done by independent laboratories  over time other current customers may have less need for our testing services 
we believe that there is a growing trend toward outsourcing of the integrated circuit test process 
as a result  we anticipate continued growth in the test laboratory business 
however  there is no assurance that this trend will continue 
in an attempt to diversify our sales mix  we may seek to develop and introduce new or advanced products  and to acquire other companies in the semiconductor equipment manufacturing business 
acquisition and integration of new businesses could disrupt our ongoing business  distract management and employees  increase our expenses and adversely affect our business a portion of any future growth may be accomplished through the acquisition of other entities 
the success of those acquisitions will depend  in part  on our ability to integrate the acquired personnel  operations  products  services and technologies into our organization  to retain and motivate key personnel of the acquired entities and to retain the customers of those entities 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities  obtain financing on acceptable terms to bring the acquisition to fruition or to integrate such personnel  operations  products or services 
the process of identifying and closing acquisition opportunities and integrating acquisitions into our operations may distract our management and employees  disrupt our ongoing business  increase our expenses and materially and adversely affect our operations 
we may also be subject to certain other risks if we acquire other entities  such as the assumption of additional liabilities 
we may issue additional equity securities or incur debt to pay for future acquisitions 
we do not have contracts with key suppliers we have no written contracts with any of our suppliers 
our suppliers may terminate their relationships with us at any time without notice 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to find satisfactory replacement suppliers or that new suppliers would not be more expensive than the current suppliers if any of our suppliers were to terminate their relationship with us 

table of contents we are highly dependent on key personnel our success has depended  and  to a large extent will depend  on the continued services of sw yong  our chief executive officer and president  victor h

the loss of these key personnel  who would be difficult to replace  could harm our business and operating results 
competition for management in our industry is intense and we may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining the executive management and other key personnel that we require 
our management has significant influence over corporate decisions currently our officers and directors and their affiliates beneficially own of the outstanding shares of common stock  including options held by them that are exercisable within days of the date of this k 
as a result  they may be able to significantly influence matters requiring approval of the shareholders  including the election of directors  and may be able to delay or prevent a change in control of the company 
we have not paid cash dividends we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we anticipate that the future earnings  if any  will be retained for use in the business or for other corporate purposes 
we do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future 
possible dilutive effect of outstanding options as of june   there were  shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding stock options 
the outstanding options are currently exercisable at exercise prices ranging from to per share 
we anticipate that the trading price of our common stock at the time of exercise of any such outstanding options will exceed the exercise price under those options 
thus such exercise will have a dilutive effect on our shareholders 
the market price for our common stock is subject to fluctuation the trading price of our common stock has from time to time fluctuated widely 
the trading price may similarly fluctuate in the future in response to quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  announcements of innovations or new products by us or our competitors  general conditions in the semiconductor industry and other events or factors 
in addition  in recent years  broad stock market indices in general  and the securities of technology companies in particular  have experienced substantial price fluctuations on a daily basis 
fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock may adversely affect our liquidity 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio is generally comprised of cash deposits 
our policy is to place these investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate and thus subject us to market risk due to those fluctuations 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  we do not expect any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio
