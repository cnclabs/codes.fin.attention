item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of ibis including notes thereto and selected financial data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview ibis technology corporation ibis was formed in october and commenced operations in january ibis initial activities consisted of producing and selling simox soi wafers and conducting research and development activities 
this research led to the development of proprietary next generation oxygen implanters  the ibis  which we began selling in  and the i  and also to other proprietary process technology 
initially  much of our revenue was derived from research and development contracts and sales of wafers for military applications 
over the years  there was a shift in revenue to sales of simox soi wafers for commercial applications and the nature of our business has evolved through stages where sometimes our revenues primarily resulted from selling wafers for evaluation purposes  and sometimes our revenue was generated primarily from equipment sales 
this is a normal path to follow while developing and promoting a fundamental new technology  especially when it relates to the semiconductor industry embracing any change that affects fabrication operations 
this trend is expected to continue in the near term as our customers continue to sample soi and the early adopters work to achieve stable production processes and enter pilot production 
we believe that we are in the technology rollout stage of our corporate life cycle 
our fundamental simox soi technology has been developed  refined  and proven over the last dozen years 
in  ibis introduced the next generation production worthy simox soi  which includes both the modified low dose mld wafer process licensed to ibis by ibm and the i  our next generation oxygen implanter  which is capable of producing eight and twelve inch or and mm simox soi wafers 
in  we commenced a program to design and develop the i  introduced it in march and began shipping mm wafers implanted from this machine shortly thereafter 
a majority of the wafers shipped in the fourth quarter of were mm 
in september  we received an order valued at approximately million for an i oxygen implanter from a major semiconductor manufacturer 
the implanter was shipped to this customer in the last quarter of and is undergoing factory acceptance 
commercial shipments of our wafers have been used principally for evaluation purposes or pilot production in products  including microprocessors  gate arrays  asics application specific integrated circuits  memories drams  srams  etc  and cellular and mobile radio components 
from our customers perspective  the pathway to soi adoption is complex and time consuming 
typically  a customer will go through three major stages sampling  where preliminary performance characteristics are explored and verified  r d  where specific customer specifications are tested and developed  and production  where yield and cost benefits are optimized 
each of these stages has many steps  and customers must evaluate each new wafer technology that essentially lays a new foundation for substantially all other processes they have spent billions of dollars and decades of time developing 
accordingly  it takes anywhere from to months for a customer to proceed from initial sampling through r d to initial production  which is not unlike the standard process for qualifying any new wafer material 
these steps apply each time there is a change in the customer s fabrication process  such as a feature size change or new material 
to date  most of our customers have purchased wafers for the purpose of characterizing and evaluating the wafers  developing prototype products or for pilot production  consequently historical sales are not necessarily an indication of future operations 
at december   ibis had eight ibis implanters  two of which are owned by a customer  available to produce up to mm simox wafers and one i available to produce mm simox wafers 
one more ibis implanter is available for sale and an additional one is dedicated as a research and development tool 
we also have two additional i implanters under construction that will be available for sale or utilized internally for wafer production 
during the fourth quarter of  a majority of our wafer sales were for mm simox wafers 
although our mm and smaller wafer size production line is currently underutilized  considering our future plans  current potential business prospects and alternatives  management believes that we do not have an impairment issue at this time 
however  if our future plans and potential business prospects do not materialize  if semiconductor manufacturers fail to adopt simox technology during the current process cycle which typically last two to three years or our customers transition to the mm wafer size sooner than we anticipate  our mm and smaller wafer size production line may become obsolete and we would be required to reduce our income by an impairment loss which could be material 
we will continue to review our assumptions about our long lived assets on a periodic basis for potential impairment in future quarters 
we cannot be sure that our implanters or other long lived assets will not become impaired in the future 
in addition  the impairment factors evaluated by management may change in subsequent periods  given the current trends of the business environment 
ibis has experienced quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenue and results of operations due to the timing of receipt of equipment orders and dependence on a limited number of customers 
we expect to continue to experience fluctuations in revenue due to equipment sales and shifts in customer demands during various stages of the simox soi sales cycle 
we recognize implanter revenue in accordance with sab  which includes among other criteria  the shipment and factory installation of the implanter at the customer s location 
as a result  deferral of revenue may extend longer due to meeting these criteria 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  inventory valuation and reserves  accounts receivable reserves and the assessment of long lived asset impairment 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
below  we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from product sales  equipment sales and the sales of spare parts when all of the following criteria have been met evidence exists that the customer is bound to the transaction  the product has been delivered to the customer and  when applicable  the product has been installed and accepted by the customer  the sales price to the customer has been fixed or is determinable  and collectibility of the sale price is reasonably assured 
provisions for estimated sales returns and allowances are made at the time the products are sold 
revenue derived from contracts and services is recognized upon performance 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with revenue recognized in any period 
management analyzes various factors  including a review of specific transactions  historical experience  credit worthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions 
changes in judgments based upon these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue and cost recognized 
inventory valuation and reserves 
our policy for the valuation of inventory  including the determination of obsolete or excess inventory  requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons  generally twelve months or less 
if our estimated demand for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  we could be required to record additional inventory reserves  which would have a negative impact on our gross margin 
we reserve for a possible over supply of wafers utilizing inventory aging records and for obsolescence when engineering changes or other technological advances indicate that obsolescence has occurred 
we also adjust the valuation of inventory when estimated actual cost is significantly different than standard cost and value inventory at the lower of cost or market 
once established  any write downs of inventory are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the inventory 
accounts receivable reserves 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on a specific analysis of accounts in the receivable portfolio and a general reserve based on the aging of receivables and historical write off experience 
while management believes the allowance to be adequate  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required and could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of long lived assets 
ibis reviews the valuation of long lived assets  including property and equipment and licenses  under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
management is required to assess the recoverability of its long lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to book value 
in accordance with sfas no 
 when we determine that the carrying value of applicable long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we evaluate whether the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset 
if such a circumstance exists  we would measure an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount of the particular long lived asset or group exceeds its fair value 
we would determine the fair value based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
we adopted sfas no 
during the first quarter of without a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december product sales 
wafer product sales increased to  for the fiscal year ended december   an increase of  or from  for the fiscal year ended december  early in  ibis introduced our next generation oxygen implanter  the i  and for the first time we began shipping mm simox wafers produced on that implanter shortly thereafter 
the increase in product sales is primarily attributable to sales of mm simox wafers by ibis in the united states and the pacific rim 
for the fiscal year ended december   sales of mm wafers accounted for approximately of our total wafer product sales 
this increases was offset by decreased wafer sales by ibis in europe  as a result of continued adverse business conditions for one of our largest wafer customers that is in the optical components arena 
contract and other revenue 
contract and other revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was  compared to  for the fiscal year ended december   a decrease of  or  which is due to decreased government contract work 
equipment revenue 
equipment revenue increased to  for the fiscal year ended december  from  for the fiscal year ended december   an increase of  or 
equipment revenue in included approximately  of revenue recognized from the sale of an ibis to our customer in china 
this implanter was shipped in december  however  revenue was recognized upon customer site acceptance which occurred during the third quarter of equipment revenue for consisted solely of parts and service revenue 
field service revenue accounted for  or of equipment revenue for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to  or of equipment revenue for the fiscal year ended december  sales of spare parts accounted for  or of equipment revenue for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to  or of equipment revenue for the fiscal year ended december  total sales and revenue 
total sales and revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was  an increase of  or from  for the fiscal year ended december  approximately million of this increase is due to the revenue recognized from the sale of an ibis implanter to a customer in china and the remainder is due to sales of mm simox wafers by ibis 
total cost of sales and revenue 
cost of wafer product sales for the fiscal year ended december  was  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended december   an increase of  or 
this increase is mainly attributable to the increase in fixed costs associated with production  which include depreciation  amortization and occupancy costs 
equipment repair and maintenance  outside testing services and royalty expenses incurred on the mld process also increased 
in addition  the optimum production yield on our mm wafer products has not yet been realized which resulted in higher costs 
cost of contract and other revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended december   a decrease of  or 
cost of equipment revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended december   an increase of  or 
this increase is due to costs recognized on the sale of an ibis implanter to a customer in china 
there were no implanter sales last year 
as a result of the foregoing  the total cost of sales and revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended december   an increase of  or 
the gross margin for all sales was a negative for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to a negative for the fiscal year ended december  the negative gross margin in for all sales is attributable to increased wafer costs and less than optimal production yields on new products  which were partially offset by a gross margin on equipment revenue 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended december  were  of total revenue as compared to  of total revenue for the fiscal year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this is a result of a decrease in legal fees of approximately  offset by salaries and related expenses 
marketing and selling expenses 
marketing and selling expenses for the fiscal year ended december  were  of total revenue as compared to  of total revenue for the fiscal year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the decrease in marketing and selling expenses is a result of a decrease in salaries and related expenses and advertising 
research and development expenses 
internally funded research and development expenses increased by  or to  of total revenue for the fiscal year ended december  from  of total revenue for the fiscal year ended december  this increase is primarily due to increased depreciation on fixed assets  specifically the ibis r d tool and i test stands  as well as increased consulting services 
other income 
total other income for the fiscal year ended december  was  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the decrease in total other income is attributable to non recurring income recognized in amounting to approximately million which is the result of an expired wafer production capacity option and decreased interest income earned as a result of lower average cash balances and a reduction in interest rates 
as of december   the company had federal net operating loss and general business credit carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively  for tax purposes expiring through as a result of the public stock offering that closed in april of  shares at per share  a change of ownership occurred within the meaning of sec 
g of the internal revenue code  which limits the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income 
subsequent ownership changes could give rise to further limitation on the company s ability to utilize these net operating loss and general business credit carryforwards 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december product sales 
wafer product sales decreased to  for the fiscal year ended december   a decrease of  or from  for the fiscal year ended december  the decrease in product sales is attributable to decreased wafer sales by ibis in europe  as the impact of the order cutback announced in mid april from one of our largest wafer customers in the optical components arena  was realized 
in the pacific rim wafer sales increased overall during this twelve month period 
sales by ibis in the united states also increased overall during this twelve month period  even though our largest domestic customer delayed further simox soi wafer purchases during their qualification of our advantox mld process 
in december  ibis entered into a royalty bearing license agreement with this customer which gives ibis the right to manufacture and sell simox soi wafers using the licensed process 
ibis began shipping sample quantities of this material in may contract and other revenue 
contract and other revenue decreased for the fiscal year ended december  to  from  for the fiscal year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this decrease is due to decreased government contract work 
equipment revenue 
equipment revenue decreased to  for the fiscal year ended december  from  for the fiscal year ended december   a decrease of  or 
equipment revenue in included an implanter sale  whereas equipment revenue for consisted solely of parts and service revenue 
field service revenue accounted for  or of equipment revenue for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to  or of equipment revenue for the fiscal year ended december  sales of spare parts accounted for  or of equipment revenue for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to  or of equipment revenue for the fiscal year ended december  total sales and revenue 
total sales and revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was  a decrease of  or from  for the fiscal year ended december  approximately million of this decrease is due to the lack of an implanter sale in and the remainder is due primarily to a decrease in wafer sales to two customers 
total cost of sales and revenue 
cost of wafer product sales for the fiscal year ended december  was  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended december   an increase of  or 
this increase is primarily attributable to the increase in fixed costs associated with production  which include depreciation  amortization and occupancy costs 
equipment repair and maintenance and wafer reserves also increased 
cost of contract and other revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended december   a decrease of  or 
cost of equipment revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this decrease is due to lack of implanter sales and increased equipment reserves in compared to the prior year which included the cost of an implanter 
as a result of the foregoing  the total cost of sales and revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended december   an increase of  or 
the gross margin for all sales was a negative for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to a positive for the fiscal year ended december  this decrease in gross margin for all sales is attributable to decreased wafer sales  the lack of implanter sales  increased fixed wafer costs and an increase in reserve for excess or obsolete parts 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended december  were  of total revenue as compared to  of total revenue for the fiscal year ended december   an increase of  or 
this is primarily a result of an increase in legal fees of approximately  marketing and selling expenses 
marketing and selling expenses for the fiscal year ended december  were  of total revenue as compared to  of total revenue for the fiscal year ended december   an increase of  or 
the increase in marketing and sales expenses is primarily a result of an increase in customer support expenses 
research and development expenses 
internally funded research and development expenses increased by  or to  of total revenue for the fiscal year ended december  from  of total revenue for the fiscal year ended december  this increase is primarily due to increased material expenses on ibis simox soi wafer development programs  which were partially offset by a decrease in consulting services used for the design and development effort on our next generation oxygen implanter  the i other income 
total other income for the fiscal year ended december  was  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended december   an increase of  or 
the increase in total other income is attributable to non recurring income amounting to approximately million which is the result of an expired wafer production capacity option 
this was offset by decreased interest income earned as a result of lower average cash balances and a reduction in interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   ibis had cash and cash equivalents of  reflecting the receipt of a majority of the proceeds from the sale of an i implanter in december which was due upon shipment 
in addition  in march   ibis completed a public offering of  shares of common stock at per share  and on april    shares were exercised as an over allotment by the underwriter 
the shares were included in a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission on july  and declared effective on july  net proceeds from the offering were approximately million and were used primarily to fund research and development  capital expenditures and working capital 
during the fiscal year ended december   ibis used  of cash for operating activities as compared to  in depreciation and amortization expense for the fiscal years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
this accounted for and of total revenue  respectively 
due to the capital intensive nature of ibis business and the recent expansion of our mm simox wafer production line  management expects that depreciation and amortization will continue to be a significant portion of our expenses 
to date  ibis working capital requirements have been funded primarily through debt and equity financings 
the principal uses of cash during the fiscal year ended december  were to fund operations and additions to property and equipment which totaled  at december   ibis had commitments to purchase approximately  in material to be used for wafer manufacturing or for the i implanters currently under construction  and approximately  in capital equipment purchases 
in september  ibis entered into a million equipment lease line with heller financial s commercial equipment finance group 
the lease line was used to finance the purchase of process equipment for wafer production  primarily mm wafers 
this line was fully drawn down in two sale leaseback transactions  bearing interest at approximately with a term of three years  and a monthly net payment of approximately  ibis has a fair market value purchase option at the end of the lease term 
the lease line is secured by the underlying assets and all other property and equipment of ibis 
our existing cash resources are believed to be sufficient to support ibis operations on our anticipated scale for the next twelve months 
our anticipated scale of operations assumes that wafer sales  primarily mm simox  continue a positive trend in  with the exception of the first quarter which we expect to be down primarily because our largest wafer customer is still evaluating multiple types of mld wafers for mm production 
we also anticipate that our spending rates for will reduce to more normal levels now that we have completed the build of our second mm wafer production line 
in addition our outlook includes the receipt of orders for one to three implanters 
we continue to explore equity offerings and other forms of financing and anticipate that we may be required to raise additional capital in the future in order to finance future growth and our research and development programs 
ibis has commitments that expire at various times through capital leases shown below are for simox wafer manufacturing equipment and operating leases are primarily for facility costs for ibis offices and manufacturing facility 
other contractual obligations consist of purchase commitments for capital expenditures 
capital leases operating leases other contractual obligations total years ending december effects of inflation ibis believes that over the past three years inflation has not had a significant impact on our sales or operating results
