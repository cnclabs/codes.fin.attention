actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the company s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable

actual future results and other assumed variables could differ from these estimates 
the company engaged an independent valuation consultant to assist the company in determining the fair values used in the impairment assessment 
in the company s application of the income approach  it assumed a cash flow period of years  a discount rate of  and a terminal value based on the tenth year s estimated future cash flows
