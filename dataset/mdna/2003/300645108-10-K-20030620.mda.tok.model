industry background communications technology has evolved from simple analog voice signals transmitted over networks of copper telephone lines to complex analog and digital voice and data signals transmitted over hybrid networks of media  such as copper  coaxial and fiber optic cables 
this evolution has been driven by large increases in the number of users and the complexity and variety of the data transmitted over networks resulting from the substantial growth in the internet and its transformation from a text based medium to a multimedia platform containing images  video and sound  the growth of wireless communications  and the increased demand for remote network access and higher speed  higher bandwidth communication between lans  mans and wans 
the majority of installed communications systems were designed to transmit only voice communications  and  therefore  are inadequate for the high bandwidth transmission of both voice and data 
access to the public network is typically based on asynchronous technologies  such as t e carrier over copper wire 
the demand for 
table of contents greater bandwidth is driving a migration from lower speed t e  to higher speed t e transmission rates 
the t e standard permits the transmission of data at mbps mbps  and the t e standard permits the transmission of data at mbps mbps 
the backbone of the public network is built on an optical fiber transmission medium that employs synchronous technologies such as sonet sdh 
similar to the utilization of faster transmission rates over copper wire  sonet sdh protocols such as oc mbps are being upgraded to oc mbps and oc gbps to increase the bandwidth over a single optical fiber 
the market dynamics of the communications industry have changed significantly since many carriers that spent billions of dollars building out their networks in and prior years were not successful in executing their business models  and consequently  were sold or declared bankruptcy 
incumbent telephone companies such as at t corp  sprint corporation and mci worldcom  inc and regional bell operating companies such as bellsouth corporation  verizon communications inc and sbc communications inc have substantially reduced their capital expenditures in line with current revenues 
this dynamic has severely impacted exar s customers  communications equipment oems  or original equipment manufacturers  many of which have undergone or are undergoing extensive restructuring to eliminate excess inventory and to reduce expenses by significantly downsizing their organizations 
at the same time  the company s oem customers are and will continue to come under tremendous pressure to develop new products for access and man markets that will enable carriers to leverage their current network infrastructure 
to address these evolving requirements of the communications industry  oems must develop and introduce increasingly sophisticated systems with fewer engineering resources 
to achieve the performance and functionality required of these systems  communications oems are using increasingly complex communications ics  which now account for a significant portion of the value added proprietary content of these systems 
as a result of the need for new equipment introductions  coupled with the reduction in their technical staff  the proliferation of transmission standards and the difficulty of designing and producing communications ics  equipment suppliers are increasingly outsourcing the design and production of the ics incorporated into their systems 
the key ics contained in a typical communications system include physical interface  access control  network processor  traffic manager and switch fabric devices 
the physical interface device consists of a transmitter and receiver that  when integrated  is called a transceiver 
transceivers interface with the physical transmission media  such as copper wire or optical fiber 
most of these high speed  mixed signal ics convert parallel digital signals into a single analog bit stream that is up to times faster than the original signal 
transceivers therefore serve as a bridge between analog transmission media and the digital devices that process data 
access control circuits are digital ics that format  or frame  the data  perform error checking and in some applications aggregate signals by mapping multiple lower speed data streams to a single higher speed stream 
the traffic manager manages the transfer of data between the network processor and the switch fabric  which work together to shape  route and control the data 
because physical interface and access control ics interface with the transmission media and are critical to increasing bandwidth  these ics must offer high speed and robust performance 
therefore  communications equipment oems seek ic suppliers that possess extensive analog and digital expertise to provide high speed  mixed signal solutions to bridge the analog physical world and the digital computing environment 
this must be coupled with system level expertise so that a supplier can quickly bring to market high performance  highly reliable ics with optimal feature sets

backlog exar defines backlog to include oem orders and distributor orders for which a delivery schedule has been specified for product shipment occurring primarily during the succeeding six months 
at march   exar s backlog was million  compared to million at march  exar believes that the decrease in the company s backlog was due to a reduction in carrier capital expenditures by the company s communications customers 
additionally  the decrease in backlog resulted from the shortened order to shipment time for the company s products 
over the past to months  the company has experienced an increased percentage of orders received that shipped in the same quarter 
if this practice of short order to delivery times continues  the company s backlog may be less than in previous years and a less reliable indicator of future revenue 
sales are made pursuant to either purchase orders for current delivery of standard items or agreements covering purchases over a period of time  which are frequently subject to revision and cancellation 
lead times for the release of purchase orders depend on the scheduling practices of the individual customer  and the company s rate of bookings varies from month to month 
in addition  exar s domestic distributor agreements generally permit the return of up to of purchases of the preceding quarter for purposes of stock rotation and also provide for credits to distributors in the event that exar reduces the price of any product 
because of the possibility of changes in delivery schedules  quantities actually purchased  cancellations of orders  distributor returns or price reductions  exar s backlog as of any particular date may not be representative of actual sales for any succeeding six month period 
customers can cancel a significant portion  if not all  of their backlog at their discretion without substantial penalty

overview exar designs  develops and markets high performance  high bandwidth physical interface and access control solutions for the worldwide communications infrastructure 
the company s current ic products for the communications market are designed to respond to the growing demand for cost effective line card solutions based on transmission standards such as t e carrier  atm and sonet sdh 
the company also designs  develops and markets ic products that address the needs of the serial communications market and the video and imaging markets 
exar uses its design methodologies to develop products ranging from assps  designed for industry wide applications  to semi custom solutions for specific customer applications 
these complementary products enable the company to offer a range of solutions for its customers applications 
exar s products provide the following benefits to its users increased bandwidth through the integration of multiple channels on a single device  reduced overall system cost through the integration of multiple functions on a single device  and accelerated time to market by allowing its customers to focus on core competencies and outsource standards based solutions 
the company s customers include  among others  alcatel  cisco systems  inc  digi international  inc  hewlett packard company hewlett packard  huawei technologies company  ltd  logitech international sa  nec corporation  nokia corporation  plantronics  inc and tellabs  inc 
for the fiscal year ended march   one customer  hewlett packard  accounted for of the company s net sales 
no other customer accounted for more than of the company s net sales during this period 
over the past several years  the company has actively refocused its business on products for the communications market 
in the s  the company designed  manufactured and marketed custom and general purpose analog circuits supporting many different applications 
in the s  the company transitioned its products to analog and mixed signal application specific standard products  or assps  focusing on telecommunications  data communications  computer peripherals and consumer electronics 
through the mid s  the company continued this product transition through internal development and strategic acquisitions and moved to a fabless semiconductor business model 
in  the company leveraged its analog expertise by beginning to focus its product strategy and development efforts predominantly on the communications markets 

table of contents for the fiscal year ended march   the company s communications product sales represented of its net sales 
the company markets its products in the americas through independent non exclusive sales representatives and independent non exclusive distributors as well as the company s own direct sales organization 
additionally  the company is represented in europe and asia pacific region by its wholly owned subsidiaries 
the company s international sales represented  and of net sales for the years ended march   and  respectively 
these international sales consist primarily of export sales from the united states that are denominated in united states dollars 
such international sales and operations expose the company to fluctuations in currency exchange rates because the company s foreign operating expenses are denominated in foreign currency while its sales are denominated in united states dollars 
the company has adopted a set of practices to minimize its foreign currency risk  which include the occasional use of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge the operating results of its foreign subsidiaries against this currency exchange risk 
although foreign sales within certain countries or foreign sales comprised of certain products may subject the company to tariffs  the company s profit margin on international sales of ics  adjusted for differences in product mix  is not significantly different from that realized on the company s sales to domestic customers 
the company s operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of several factors that could materially and adversely affect the company s future profitability  as described below in risk factors 
to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operating results 
financial outlook for fiscal year the company believes that further capital expenditure reductions and reduced enterprise spending by communications carriers in calendar year will put further downward pressure on demand for equipment and products sold by exar s customers 
as a consequence  exar continues to experience limited visibility with respect to customer demand for its communications products 
the company expects that long term video  imaging and other revenue will decline further due to anticipated decreases in imaging product sales resulting from hewlett packard s product transitions  seasonality and competing sources 
the company may not be able to sustain or grow its communications revenue sufficiently to offset the anticipated decline in its video  imaging and other revenue  thus the company s future results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted 
the company believes that these factors may be offset  in part  by the improved operational efficiencies resulting from the cost containment measures undertaken by exar commencing in fiscal year through fiscal year the company has continued to witness the design of its communication devices into several of its customers new and enhanced networking equipment  contributing to the company s belief that it is positioned for growth as market conditions improve 
in addition  the company s serial communication devices achieved record level design wins in fiscal year however  if the company s assumptions prove to be inaccurate  the design wins fail to result in significant revenue or the company experiences pressure on its bookings and backlog as a result of competition or unfavorable market conditions  the company s future results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted 
the company anticipates that interest income will continue to be under pressure as interest rates remain at historical lows 
the company plans to continue exchanging some of its shorter termed marketable securities for longer termed marketable securities in order to capitalize on higher yields offered by longer termed securities 
however  if the company consumes cash in excess of future cash receipts  resulting in decreased average cash balances available for earning interest  the company s results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted 

table of contents critical accounting policies and use of estimates the us securities and exchange commission the sec has released fr cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  which encourages companies to disclose critical accounting policies  judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies and the likelihood that materially different financial results would be reported under different conditions or with the use of different assumptions 
such critical accounting policies  as defined by the sec  are those that are both most significant to the depiction of a company s financial condition and results and require the use of difficult  subjective and complex judgment by management  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are uncertain 
the company s financial statements and accompanying disclosures  which are prepared in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  require that management use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically  and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period for which they are determined to be necessary 
exar s most critical accounting policies relate to net sales  reserves for excess inventories  income taxes and investments in non public entities 
these accounting policies  the basis for the underlying estimates and the potential impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  should any of the estimates prove to be inaccurate  are further described below net sales net sales are comprised of product deliveries principally to oems or their contract manufacturers and non exclusive domestic distributors 
for the fiscal year ended march   and of net sales were derived from product sales to oems and non exclusive domestic distributors  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended march   and of net sales were derived from product sales to oems and non exclusive domestic distributors  respectively 
the company recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
the company has agreements with its non exclusive domestic distributors  which provide for returns and allowances to these distributors 
the company records an allowance  at the time of delivery to such distributors  based on authorized and historical patterns of returns and other concessions 
the following is a description of the provisions of the agreements allowing the distributors certain volume based discounts and rights of return 
a volume discounts 
the company provides for discounts based on volume ordered by a distributor for a specific product with a specified volume for a given customer over a period not to exceed one year 
exar records a provision for future volume discounts when the related revenue is recognized 
the provision is based on historical information and other known factors 
if the company s provision does not accurately reflect future volume discounts  the company s net sales could be materially and adversely affected 
b stock rotation 
the company allows a non exclusive domestic distributor to exchange products  generally in an amount of up to of the amount purchased in the preceding quarter  provided that a purchase order from the distributor for an equal dollar amount of other products is in place at the same time of the exchange authorization 
the company uses historical information along with current market conditions and experiences to support the allowance recorded against sales for potential future stock rotations 
this allowance is recorded at the same time that revenue is recognized 
if the recorded allowance does not accurately reflect future stock rotations  the company s net sales could be materially and adversely affected 
as of march   the company had  of allowances for future volume discounts and stock rotation related to sales that were recorded during the fiscal year ended march  the company has 
table of contents estimated volume discounts and stock rotation required by its distributors 
however  the company s actual experience could differ from its original estimated allowances  therefore requiring adjustments to revenues in the relevant period 
inventories the company s policy is to establish accruals against inventory supply in excess of approximately six months of forecasted demand  unless there are other factors indicating that the inventory will be sold at a profit after six months 
such factors include  among others  known backlog of orders  projected sales and marketing forecasts  shipment activity  inventory on hand at the company s distributors  past and current market conditions  anticipated demand for the company s products and current business conditions when determining if a provision for excess inventory is required 
the company s net inventories at march  were million  compared with million at march  the decrease of million was primarily the result of the million write off of inventory in fiscal year should management s assumptions used in estimating the provision for excess inventory differ from actual future demand or should market conditions become less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which would impact the results of operations 
deferred income tax assets income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis  operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
changes in tax rates affect the deferred income tax assets and liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the tax rates are enacted 
in the event that the company is unable to generate sufficient operating income in future periods  the deferred tax assets including the operating loss and credit carryforward components of the deferred tax assets would not be realized  which would result in a write down of the deferred tax assets and a reduction of net income or an increase in net loss 
investments in non public entities internet machines corporation in july  exar invested million in the series c preferred stock financing for a equity interest in internet machines corporation imc  a pre revenue  privately held company which has developed a family of highly integrated communications ics designed to provide protocol independent network processing  switch fabric and traffic management solutions for high speed optical  man and internet infrastructure equipment 
because imc is a non public company  determining the market value of this investment is judgmental in nature and depends on management s assessment of imc s performance  among other factors 
management must assess  among other matters  the possibility of successful introduction of imc s new products at a point in time when there is market demand for this new technology 
this investment is subject to risks  including the risks that a suitable market for such technology may not exist as imc markets it products  or that a competitor may develop a similar or superior product  or that the new products may fail to meet market demand  or that market demand fails to develop for imc s new products 
should any of these or other risks materialize  this asset would become impaired 
in such case  the company would be required to write down the asset and record the related expense in the same period 
during the three months ended september   the company became aware of a potential decline in the value of its equity investment in imc 
as a result  the company retained an independent third party to assist in determining the fair market value of its investment 
as a consequence  the company recorded against its earnings an investment impairment charge of million  reducing its equity investment from million to million 
if the company s assessed value of its investment were to fall below the carrying value  the company would be required to recognize additional impairment to the investment  resulting in additional expense in the company s consolidated statements of operations

the company reviews the fund s investments periodically to determine if there has been a temporary or permanent decline in the market value of the investments below the value at which the company is carrying them on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
in assessing the potential of an impairment to the investment  the company considers the fund performance information provided by the fund s general partner together with other independent market information and makes an estimate of the future market potential of the venture capital fund 
if the company s assessed value of its investment were to fall below the carrying value  the company would be required to recognize impairment to the asset  resulting in additional expense on the company s consolidated statements of operations

fiscal years ended march  communications video  imaging and other fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  net sales net sales for the fiscal year ended march  increased by to million compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  the increase in net sales during fiscal year resulted from a increase in video  imaging and other product sales  primarily as a result of sales to hewlett packard 
for the fiscal years ended march  and  sales to hewlett packard represented and  respectively of net sales  consisting of shipments of the company s imaging products to support hewlett packard s multifunction products 
the company expects that long term video  imaging and other revenue will decline further due to anticipated decreases in imaging product sales resulting from hewlett packard s product transitions  seasonality and competing sources 
although the company anticipates an increase in communications product sales  this increase may not be sufficient to offset the estimated decline in video and imaging product sales 
if communications product sales do not increase to offset such anticipated decline  the company s financial condition and results of operations will likely be adversely impacted 

table of contents in the fiscal year ended march   sales to north american customers remained relatively stable as compared with fiscal year international sales increased by to million  as compared to million for the prior fiscal year  primarily the result of increased imaging product sales to hewlett packard 
gross profit gross profit represents net sales less cost of sales 
cost of sales includes the cost of purchasing the finished silicon wafers manufactured by independent foundries  costs associated with assembly  packaging  test  quality assurance and product yields  the cost of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support and manufacturing engineering  and charges for excess inventory 
included in the cost of sales for the fiscal year ended march  is a million charge taken by the company during the three months ended september  to write down inventory the company determined to be excess 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal year ended march   including the inventory write down of million  was compared to for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the inventory write down of million  partially offset by the company s ability to achieve manufacturing efficiencies resulting from increased production volumes 
such efficiencies were modestly offset by the increase in imaging and video product sales  which typically have lower margins than the company s communications products  for the fiscal year ended march   when compared to the same period a year ago 
the company anticipates that gross profit will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of net sales due to future fluctuations in net sales  fluctuations in manufacturing costs  competitive pricing strategies  changes in product mix and other factors 
research and development research and development r d costs consist primarily of the salaries and related expenses of engineering employees engaged in research  design and development activities  costs related to design tools  supplies and services  and facilities expenses 
r d expenses for the fiscal year ended march  were million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  for the fiscal year ended march  as a continuation of the cost containment measures undertaken by the company in the fiscal year ended march   the company implemented an approximate workforce reduction effected on october  to further align the company s expenses with anticipated revenue the october workforce reduction 
in connection with the october workforce reduction  the company reduced the number of engineering employees engaged in r d 
the company began to realize the cost benefits associated with these measures were realized in the quarter ended march  the company anticipates that the impact of these cost benefits will be partially offset by increased spending on product development 
some aspects of the company s research and development efforts require significant short term expenditures  the timing of which may cause significant fluctuations in the company s expenses 
the company expects that r d expenses as a percentage of net sales will continue to fluctuate in the future because of the timing of expenditures and changes in the level of net sales 
the company believes that technological innovation is critical to its long term success  and it intends to continue to make substantial investments to enhance its product offerings to meet the current and future technological requirements of its customers and markets

in connection with the october workforce reduction  the company reduced the number of employees engaged in selling  marketing and administration 
the cost benefits associated with the october workforce reduction began to be realized in the quarter ended march  however  it is possible that future sg a expenses will increase in absolute dollars as a result of possible future expansion of the company s infrastructure to support potential acquisition and integration activities  and a general expansion of the company s operations 
the company continues to assess its cost structure and other programs to improve operational efficiencies 
in the short term  many of the sg a expenses are fixed  which results in a decline in sg a expense as a percentage of net sales in periods of increasing net sales and an increase as a percentage of net sales when net sales decrease 
other income loss  net other income loss  net primarily consists of impairment charges  interest income  realized gains on marketable securities  and losses or gains resulting from investments in non public companies and venture funds 
for the fiscal year ended march   other income loss  net decreased to a loss of million from income of million for the prior fiscal year 
this decrease resulted principally from a million loss on long term investments resulting from impairment charges

net realized gains on investments were  for the fiscal year ended march   as compared to  for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease resulted from greater sales of marketable securities in fiscal year relative to fiscal year provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for the year ended march  differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal rate 
this difference is principally due to the company s decision not to recognize a tax benefit for the million imc asset impairment charge 
this decision resulted from the company s uncertainty regarding whether it will earn sufficient future capital gains to offset this capital loss after the loss is recognized for tax purposes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal year  excluding the asset impairment charge  was  which is the same as the income tax rate recorded by the company in fiscal year  compared with the federal statutory rate of

table of contents contributed to the improved gross margins reported by the company in fiscal year excluding the inventory write down 
such efficiencies were modestly offset by the increase in imaging and video product sales  which typically have lower margins than the company s communications products 
the company s operating results for fiscal year improved from those reported in fiscal year  excluding the asset impairment charge of million related to the decline in the fair market value of the company s equity investment in imc 
the improvement in operating results was primarily due to higher sales and cost containment measures implemented by the company in fiscal year and sustained through fiscal year liquidity and capital resources the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements  investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt 
additionally  the company is not a party to any derivative contracts  nor does it have any synthetic leases 
due to the strength of its financial position  the company elected not to renew a credit facility agreement with a domestic bank under which it had been permitted to execute up to million in foreign currency transactions 
at march   the company had no foreign currency contracts outstanding 
the company s principal source of liquidity in fiscal years and were cash and cash equivalents  short term marketable securities and long term marketable securities which increased by million to million at march  from million at march  cash and cash equivalents decreased from million at march  to million at march  the decrease was due to net cash used in investing activities of million  partially offset by net cash provided by operating activities of million and net cash provided by financing activities of million 
the company generated cash flows from operating activities of million in the fiscal year ended march  as compared to million in the fiscal year ended march  the positive cash flow from operations in fiscal year was attributable  in part  to a million refund from the internal revenue service resulting from favorable tax law changes under the federal economic stimulus bill  which enabled companies to apply any net operating tax losses to taxable income realized in the previous five years 
also contributing to the positive operating cash flow for the fiscal year ended march  were million in additional adjustments to the million net loss for depreciation and amortization  loss on other long term investments  provision for doubtful accounts and inventory write down and a million decrease in inventories 
these amounts were slightly offset by increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses 
the company generated cash from operating activities of million during the fiscal year ended march  adjustments to net income of million for that year included million of non cash charges and changes in working capital 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in the fiscal year ended march  as compared to million in the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   the company s investing activities included proceeds from the maturity of million and million of short term and long term marketable securities  respectively 
for the same period  purchases of both short term and long term securities were million and million  respectively 
purchases of manufacturing test equipment  computer equipment  software and hardware used for product development amounted to million for the fiscal year ended march  included in purchases of property and equipment were progress payments totaling million related to the on site power generation project that the company has undertaken in order to produce its own electricity for its fremont headquarters 
the company expects that the total on site power generation project costs  net of an approximate  refund to be issued by the california energy commission  will be approximately million 
the on site power generation project is expected to be completed and to become operational by june  as of march   the company had funded  of its million committed capital in the skypoint fund 
as of june   the company had funded million of its committed capital 
however  
table of contents during the quarter ended september   the skypoint fund refunded  of the company s previous capital contribution 
the company is obligated to contribute its remaining committed capital of approximately million as needed 
to meet its capital commitment to the fund  the company may need to use its existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
effective may   the company and techfarm ventures management llc agreed to  among other matters  reduce the company s capital commitment in the techfarm fund to approximately million  or approximately of the techfarm fund s total committed capital 
as of june   the company had satisfied its capital contribution obligation through the final capital contribution of  net cash provided by financing activities totaled million in the fiscal year ended march  as compared to million in the fiscal year ended march  representing proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
during fiscal year  the company received million from the issuance of approximately  shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options under the company s stock option plans and the purchase of shares of common stock under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
in march  the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to acquire outstanding common stock in the open market 
under this program  the board of directors authorized the acquisition of up to million of exar s common stock 
during the fiscal year ended march   the company acquired  shares of its common stock for million 
although the company did not repurchase any of its outstanding shares during fiscal years and  the company may utilize this program in the future  which would reduce cash  cash equivalents and or marketable securities available to fund future operations and meet other liquidity requirements 
the company places purchase orders with wafer foundries and other vendors as part of its normal course of business 
as of march   the company had approximately million of outstanding purchase commitments with several suppliers for the purchase of wafers  capital equipment and various service contracts 
the company expects to receive and pay for the wafers and capital equipment within the next six months and pay for its various service contracts over the next twelve months from its existing cash balances 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual payment obligations and commitments as of march  in thousands fiscal year thereafter total contractual obligations purchase obligations venture investment commitments skypoint fund lease obligations total the payments related to the venture commitment  skypoint fund  do not have a set payment schedule 
the remaining amount payable to the fund will be required to be paid at the discretion of the fund s management and in accordance with the limited partnership agreement with the fund 
the company anticipates that it will continue to finance its operations with cash flows from operations  existing cash and investment balances  and some combination of long term debt and or lease financing and additional sales of equity securities 
the combination and sources of capital will be determined by management based on the company s needs and prevailing market conditions 
the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents  short term marketable securities  long term marketable securities and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy working capital requirements and capital equipment needs for at least the next 
table of contents months 
however  should the demand for the company s products decrease in the future  the availability of cash flows from operations may be limited  thus possibly having a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
from time to time  the company evaluates potential acquisitions and equity investments complementary to its design expertise and market strategy  which may include investments in wafer fabrication foundries 
to the extent that the company pursues or positions itself to pursue these transactions  the company could choose to seek additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing could be obtained on terms acceptable to the company 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt could result in dilution to the company s stockholders

risk factors the company is subject to a number of risks 
some of these risks are endemic to the fabless semiconductor industry and are the same or similar to those disclosed in the company s previous sec filings  and some risks may arise in the future 
you should carefully consider all of these risks and the other information in this report before investing in the company 
the fact that certain risks are endemic to the industry does not lessen the significance of these risks 
as a result of these risks  the company s business  financial condition or operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
this could cause the trading price of the company s common stock to decline  and stockholders might lose some or all of their investment 
if the company is unable to generate additional revenue from the sale of its communications products  or its revenue from these products declines  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely impacted 
although communications revenue is expected to grow in the long term  it may not grow fast enough to offset the expected decline in revenue from non communications products 
if communications revenue does not increase in the future  the company s financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely impacted 
the company is continuing to focus a significant portion of its research and sales resources on the communications market 
as a result  the company s dependence on this market  as compared to exar s dependence on other markets  such as video and imaging  is increasing 
given the company s increasing dependence on the communications market to support revenue growth  the company must continue to generate 
table of contents additional sales from this market  either by taking market share from competitors or by maintaining market share while in a growing market 
if the company is not able to generate additional revenue in the communications market  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely impacted 
the slowdown and uncertainty in the us and global economies may continue to adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits  lower capital spending  the impact of the iraq war  the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and other geopolitical factors have had  and continue to have  a negative impact on the us and global economies 
many of the company s customers continue to experience significant declines in demand for their products as a result of continued uncertainty regarding future capital spending by the communications service providers 
this uncertainty regarding capital spending is based upon the weak operating results of these service providers  which  in turn  have hindered their ability to obtain additional capital from the public markets in order to continue to build their networks 
communications service providers continue to face significant financial challenges and  therefore  may continue to delay or further reduce their spending on the company s customers products 
these challenges have been exacerbated by disclosures of accounting irregularities by communications service providers and other large public companies 
if the company s customers delay or cancel their orders for the company s products  the company s revenues and results of operations may be negatively impacted 
the extent and severity of this economic downturn  in conjunction with the uncertainty of the geopolitical environment  have made it difficult for the company to predict when and if demand for its products will increase 
additionally  the company does not expect the trend of lower capital spending among service providers to reverse itself in the near future 
therefore  the company does not know when or how quickly its customers will place new orders 
furthermore  the company s revenues may decline in the future  which could materially and adversely impact the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
if the company fails to develop and introduce new products that meet the evolving needs of its customers  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by changing technologies  evolving and competing industry standards  constantly changing customer requirements  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  long design to production cycles  and or increasing functional integration 
to develop successful products for the company s target markets  the company must develop  gain access to and use leading technologies in a cost effective and timely manner and continue to expand its technical and design expertise 
in addition  the company must continue to have its products designed into its customers future products and maintain close working relationships with key customers in order to develop new products that meet their changing needs 
products for communications applications are based on continually evolving industry standards 
the company s ability to compete will depend in part on its ability to identify and ensure compliance with these industry standards 
as a result  the company could be required to invest significant time  effort and expenses redesigning its products to ensure compliance with industry standards 

table of contents the process of developing new products is complex and uncertain  and if the company fails to accurately predict customers changing needs and emerging technological trends  the company s business could be harmed 
the company cannot assure that it will be able to identify new product opportunities successfully  develop and bring to market new products  achieve design wins or respond effectively to technological changes or product announcements by its competitors 
in addition  the company may not be successful in developing or using new technologies or in developing new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance 
the company s pursuit of necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense 
failure in any of these areas could harm its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the markets in which the company participates are intensely competitive 
the company s failure to compete effectively in these markets could materially and adversly impact the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s target markets are intensely competitive 
the company s ability to compete effectively in its target markets depends on  among others  the following factors the company s success in designing and delivering new products that implement new technologies in a timely manner  effectively subcontracting the manufacture of new products and delivering them in a timely manner  the quality and reliability of the company s products  the level of technical support and service furnished to the company s customers  the performance  features and price of the company s products  end user acceptance of the company s customers products  spending within the telecommunications industry  compliance of the company s products with evolving industry standards  and or market acceptance of competitors products or technologies 
in addition  the company expects that its competitors and customers will offer new products based on new technologies  industry standards or end user or customer requirements  including products that have the potential to replace or provide lower cost or higher performance alternatives to the company s current products 
the introduction of new products by the company s competitors or customers could render the company s existing and future products obsolete or unmarketable 
in addition  the company s competitors and customers may introduce products that integrate the functions performed by the company s ics on a single ic  thus eliminating the need for the company s products 
because the ic markets are highly fragmented  the company generally encounters different competitors in the various markets in which it competes 
competitors with respect to the company s communications products include applied micro circuits corporation  mindspeed technologies  a division of conexant systems inc  pmc sierra  inc  transwitch corporation  and vitesse semiconductor corporation 
competitors in the company s serial communications and video and imaging markets include philips electronics  texas instruments incorporated and wolfson microelectronics ltd 
many of the company s competitors have greater financial  technical and management resources than the company 
some of these competitors may be able to sell their products at prices below which it would be profitable for the company to sell its products 

table of contents the company s financial results may fluctuate significantly because of a number of factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
the company s financial results may fluctuate significantly 
some of the factors that affect the company s quarterly and annual financial results  many of which are difficult or impossible to control or predict  are the company s difficulty in predicting revenues due to limited visibility being provided by customers and channel partners  fluctuations in demand for the company s products  changes in sales and implementation cycles for the company s products  the company s ability to maintain adequate inventory levels and purchase commitments  the timing and size of orders from customers  the reduction  rescheduling or cancellation of orders by customers  the availability of materials needed by the company from its foundries and suppliers  the ability of the company s suppliers and communications service providers to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures  fluctuations in the manufacturing output  yields and capacity of the company s suppliers  changes in the mix of products that the company s customers purchase  the cost of materials and services used to make the company s products  changes in the company s shipment volume  the company s ability to successfully introduce new products  the announcement or introduction of products by the company s competitors  the availability of third party foundry  assembly and test capacity and raw materials  erosion of average selling prices as a product matures coupled with the inability to sell newer products with higher average selling prices  resulting in lower revenue and margins  competitive pressures on selling prices  product availability or new technologies  the amount and timing of costs associated with product warranties and returns  the amount and timing of the company s investments in research and development  market and or customer acceptance of the company s products  changes in customer concentration or requirements within certain market segments  consolidation among the company s competitors and or its customers  changes in the company s customers end user concentration or requirements  loss of one or more current customers  disruption in the sales or distribution channels  costs associated with strategic equity investments  acquisitions and the integration of acquired operations  the inability of the company s customers to obtain components from their other suppliers  general conditions in the economy  terrorist acts or acts of war and conditions in the communications and semiconductor industry  build up of customer and or channel inventory  
table of contents the timing and amount of employer payroll tax to be paid on the company s employees gains on stock options exercised  changes in accounting rules  such as the possible future requirement to record expenses for employee stock option grants  and or fluctuations in interest rates 
as a consequence  operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict  and prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in the future 
any of the foregoing factors  or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s operating results may vary significantly because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  and such variations could materially and adversely affect the demand for the company s products 
the company competes in the communications market within the semiconductor sector  both of which are cyclical and subject to technological change 
during the second half of the fiscal year ended march  through the quarter ended march   the semiconductor industry experienced a significant downturn characterized by diminished product demand  excess production capacity  high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
should the current economic downturn in the communications and semiconductor industry continue or worsen or simply fail to recover fully from current levels  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted 
at the same time  the semiconductor industry is subject to unexpected  periodic and sharp increases in demand in a strong economic environment  potentially leading to production capacity constraints  which could materially and adversely affect the company s ability to ship products and meet customer demand in future periods 
the company depends in part on the continued service of its key engineering and management personnel and its ability to identify  hire and retain qualified personnel 
if the company lost key employees or failed to identify  hire and retain these individuals  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted 
the company s future success depends  in part  on the continued service of its key design engineering  technical sales  marketing and executive personnel and its ability to identify  hire and retain other qualified personnel 
in the future  the company may not be able to continue to attract and retain engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of its business 
competition for skilled employees having unique technical capabilities and industry specific expertise continues to be a considerable risk inherent in the markets in which the company competes 
volatility or lack of positive performance in the company s stock price may also adversely affect the company s ability to retain key employees  most of whom have been granted stock options 
with respect to the company s management  the company s anticipated future growth is expected to continue to place additional demands on management resources and  therefore will likely require the addition of new management personnel as well as the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel 
the failure to retain and recruit key design engineers  technical  sales  marketing and executive personnel could harm the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents if the severe acute respiratory syndrome continues to spread  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted 
the company has not experienced any direct impact from the sars epidemic  which has infected large parts of asia  including china  hong kong and singapore 
the company has taken steps to limit its employees travel to known highly infected areas 
the contract manufacturers that the company uses are located in asia and some of their manufacturing facilities are located close to areas that are being impacted by sars 
if the growth of this disease continues to spread  it could negatively impact the company s ability to continue business with its contract manufacturers located in asia 
such a supply disruption with the company s contract manufacturers could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company depends on third party foundries to manufacture its ics 
any disruption in or loss of the foundries capacity to manufacture the company s products subjects it to a number of risks  including the potential for an inadequate supply of products and higher materials costs  these risks may lead to delayed product delivery or increased costs  which could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company does not own or operate a semiconductor fabrication facility 
most of its products are based on cmos processes 
although two foundries manufacture the company s products based on cmos processes  a substantial majority is manufactured at a single foundry 
that foundry has announced its intention to discontinue manufacturing products in its six inch wafer manufacturing facility and transfer the existing business to one of its eight inch wafer manufacturing facilities 
this will require the qualification and transfer of many of the company s products over the next several quarters 
the company does not have long term wafer supply agreements with its foundries that would guarantee wafer or product quantities  prices  and delivery or lead times 
rather  the foundries manufacture the company s products on a purchase order basis 
the company provides these foundries with rolling forecasts of its production requirements 
however  the ability of each foundry to provide wafers to the company is limited by the foundry s available capacity 
in addition  the company cannot be certain that it will continue to do business with its foundries on terms as favorable as its current terms 
other significant risks associated with the company s reliance on third party foundries include the lack of control over delivery schedules  the risks inherent in the announced closure and transfer of operations by one of the company s principal foundries from a facility which utilizes six inch wafer manufacturing technologies to a facility that is based on eight inch wafer manufacturing technologies  limited control over quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs  and or potential misappropriation of the company s intellectual property 
the company could experience a substantial delay or interruption in the shipment of its products or an increase in its costs due to any of the following a manufacturing disruption experienced by one or more of the company s foundries or sudden reduction or elimination of any existing source or sources of semiconductor devices  which might include the potential closure  change of ownership  change of management or consolidation by one or more of the company s foundries  extended time required to identify and qualify alternative manufacturing sources for existing or new products  failure of the company s suppliers to obtain the raw materials and equipment used in the production of its ics  
table of contents qualification and transfer of products to the eight inch wafer manufacturing facility  excess inventory associated with the transfer to the eight inch wafer manufacturing facility  acts of terrorism or civil unrest or an unanticipated shut down due to sars  and or a sudden  sharp increase in demand for semiconductor devices  which could strain foundries manufacturing resources and cause delays in manufacturing and shipment of the company s products 
if the company s foundries discontinue or fail to successfully transfer the manufacturing processes needed to meet the company s demands or fail to upgrade the technologies needed to manufacture the company s products  the company may face production delays  which could materially and adversely impact the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s wafer requirements typically represent a small portion of the total production of the foundries that manufacture its products 
as a result  the company is subject to the risk that a foundry will cease production of older or lower volume material that it uses to produce parts supplied to the company 
additionally  the company cannot be certain that its foundries will continue to devote resources to the production of its products or continue to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of the company s products are based 
each of these events could increase the company s costs and harm its ability to deliver its products on time  thereby materially and adversely affecting the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
to secure foundry capacity  the company may be required to enter into financial and other arrangements with foundries  which could result in the dilution of its earnings or otherwise harm its operating results 
allocation of a foundry s manufacturing capacity may be influenced by a foundry customer s size or the existence of a long term agreement with the foundry 
to address foundry capacity constraints  the company and other semiconductor companies that rely on third party foundries have utilized various arrangements  including equity investments in or loans to foundries in exchange for guaranteed production capacity  joint ventures to own and operate foundries  or take or pay contracts that commit a company to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods 
while the company is not currently a party to any of these arrangements  it may decide to enter into these arrangements in the future 
the company cannot be sure  however  that these arrangements will be available to it on acceptable terms  if at all 
any of these arrangements could require the company to commit substantial capital and  accordingly  could require it to reduce its cash holdings  incur additional debt or secure equity financing 
this could result in the dilution of its earnings or the ownership of its stockholders or otherwise harm its operating results 
the company s dependence on third party subcontractors to assemble and test its products subjects it to a number of risks  including the potential for an inadequate supply of products and higher materials costs  these risks may lead to delayed product delivery or increased costs  which could materially and adversely affect its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company depends on independent subcontractors for the assembly and testing of its products 
the company s reliance on these subcontractors involves the following significant risks the company s reduced control over manufacturing yields  production schedules and product quality  the potential closure  change of ownership  change of management or consolidation by one or more of the company s subcontractors  
table of contents acts of terrorism or civil unrest  delayed deliveries due to sars  difficulties in selecting  qualifying and integrating new subcontractors  limited warranties from the subcontractors for products assembled and tested for the company  maintaining availability of qualified assembly or test services  potential increases in assembly and test prices  and or potential misappropriation of the company s intellectual property 
these risks may lead to delays in the delivery of the company s products or increased costs in the finished products  either of which could harm the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s reliance on foreign suppliers exposes it to risks associated with international operations  any of which could materially and adversely impact its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company uses semiconductor wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors throughout asia to manufacture most of its products 
the company s dependence on these subcontractors involves the following risks political  civil and economic instability  disruption to transportation to and from asia  disruptions to manufacturing at subcontractors due to the outbreak of sars  embargoes affecting the availability of raw materials  equipment or services  changes in tax laws  tariffs and freight rates  and or compliance with local or foreign regulatory requirements 
these risks may lead to delays in product delivery or increased costs  either of which could harm the company s profitability and customer relationships  thereby materially and adversely impacting the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s reliance on foreign customers could cause fluctuations in its operating results  which could materially and adversely impact the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
international sales accounted for of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  international sales will likely continue to account for a significant portion of the company s revenues  which would subject the company to the following risks changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  timing and availability of export licenses  political  civil and economic instability  disruptions to customer operations due to the outbreak of sars  difficulties in accounts receivable collections  
table of contents difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary and branch operations  difficulties in managing distributors  difficulties in obtaining governmental approvals for communications and other products  limited intellectual property protection  foreign currency exchange fluctuations  the burden of complying with and the risk of violating a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  and or potentially adverse tax consequences 
in addition  because sales of the company s products have been denominated to date primarily in united states dollars  increases in the value of the united states dollar could increase the relative price of the company s products such that they become more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country 
increased international activity in the future may result in increased foreign currency denominated sales 
furthermore  because some of the company s customers purchase orders and agreements are governed by foreign laws  the company may be limited in its ability to enforce its rights under these agreements and to collect damages  if awarded 
if the company s distributors or sales representatives stopped selling  or failed to successfully promote  the company s products  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
the company sells many of its products through two non exclusive domestic distributors and numerous sales representatives 
the company s non exclusive domestic distributors and sales representatives could reduce or discontinue sales of the company s products 
they may not devote the resources necessary to sell the company s products in the volumes and within the time frames that the company expects 
in addition  the company depends on the continued viability and financial resources of these distributors and sales representatives  some of which are small organizations with limited working capital 
in turn  these distributors and sales representatives are subject to general economic and semiconductor industry conditions 
the company believes that its success will continue to depend on these distributors and sales representatives 
if some or all of the company s distributors and sales representatives experience financial difficulties  or otherwise become unable or unwilling to promote and sell the company s products  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
because the company s communications ics typically have lengthy sales cycles  the company may experience substantial delays between incurring expenses related to research and development and the generation of revenue derived from these products 
due to the communications ic equipment product cycle  historically it has taken the company more than months to realize volume shipments after its initial contact with a customer 
the company first works with customers to achieve a design win  which may take six months or longer 
the company s customers then complete the design  testing and evaluation process and begin to ramp up production  a period which typically lasts an additional six months or longer 
as a result  a significant period of time may elapse between the company s research and development efforts and its realization of revenue  if any  from volume purchasing of the company s communications products by its customers 

table of contents if the company is unable to convert a significant portion of its design wins into actual revenue  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted 
the company has secured a significant number of design wins for new and existing products 
such design wins are necessary for revenue growth of the company 
however  many of the company s design wins may never generate revenues as the company s customers own projects and product offerings may be cancelled or may fail to generate sufficient demand in their end markets 
additionally  some of the company s design wins are from privately held  early stage companies  thus increasing the risk that some of the company s design wins may not translate into future revenue because these customers may fail prior to the time that their products are ready to ship 
if design wins do generate revenue  the time lag between the design win and meaningful revenue may be in excess of months 
if the company fails to convert a significant portion of its design wins into substantial revenue  it could materially and adversely impact the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s backlog may not result in future revenue 
due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and quantities actually purchased  cancellations of orders  distributor returns or price reductions  the company s backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
a reduction of the order backlog during any particular period  or the failure of the company s backlog to result in future revenue  could negatively impact the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
fixed operating expenses and a company practice of ordering materials in anticipation of future customer demand could make it difficult for the company to respond effectively to sudden swings in demand  such sudden swings in demand could therefore have a materially adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short to medium term  and  therefore  it has limited ability to reduce expenses quickly and sufficiently in response to any revenue shortfalls 
consequently  the company s operating results will be harmed if it does not meet its revenue projections 
in addition  the company typically plans its production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
from time to time  in response to anticipated long lead times to obtain inventory and materials from the company s outside suppliers and foundries  the company may order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand 
this advance ordering may result in excess inventory levels or unanticipated inventory write downs if expected orders fail to materialize 
therefore  such revenue shortfalls could have a materially adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has in the past and may in the future make acquisitions and significant strategic equity investments  which may involve a number of risks  if the company is unable to address these risks successfully  such acquisitions and investments could have a materially adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has undertaken a number of strategic acquisitions and investments in the past and may do so from time to time in the future 
the risks involved with these acquisitions and investments include  among others diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  the possibility that the company may not receive a favorable return on its investment  the original investment may become impaired  and or the company may incur losses from these investments  and or assumption of known or unknown liabilities or other unanticipated events or circumstances 

table of contents the risks involved with acquisitions include  among others difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired companies  failure to retain key personnel  difficulties in entering markets in which the company has no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets may have stronger market positions  insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions  under performance problems with an acquired company  issuance of common stock that would dilute the company s current stockholders percentage ownership  recording of goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges against the company s future earnings  incurring amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets  the opportunity cost associated with committing capital in such investments  incurring large and immediate write offs  and or becoming subject to litigation 
the risks involved with strategic equity investments include  among others the possibility of litigation resulting from these types of investments  the possibility that the company may not receive a favorable return on its investments  the original investment may become impaired  and or incur losses from these investments  and or the opportunity cost associated with committing capital in such investments 
the company cannot assure that it will be able to address these risks successfully without substantial expense  delay or other operational or financial problems 
any delays or other such operations or financial problems could adversely impact the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company may not be able to protect its intellectual property rights adequately 
the company s ability to compete is affected by its ability to protect its intellectual property rights 
the company relies on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  mask work registrations  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and non disclosure and licensing arrangements to protect its intellectual property rights 
despite these efforts  the company cannot be certain that the steps it takes to protect its proprietary information will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of the company s technology  or that its competitors will not independently develop technology that is substantially similar or superior to the company s technology 
more specifically  the company cannot be sure that its pending patent applications or any future applications will be approved  or that any issued patents will provide it with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties 
nor can the company be sure that  if challenged  the company s patents will be found to be valid or enforceable  or that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on the company s ability to do business 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar products or processes  duplicate the company s products or processes or design around any patents that may be issued to it 

table of contents the company could be required to pay substantial damages or could be subject to various equitable remedies if it were proven that it infringed on the intellectual property rights of others 
as a general matter  the semiconductor industry is characterized by substantial litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
if a third party were to prove that the company s technology infringed a third party s intellectual property rights  the company could be required to pay substantial damages for past infringement and could be required to pay license fees or royalties on future sales of the company s products 
if the company were required to pay such license fees whenever it sold its products  such fees could exceed the company s revenue 
in addition  if it were proven that the company willfully infringed a third party s proprietary rights  the company could be held liable for three times the amount of the damages that the company would otherwise have to pay 
such intellectual property litigation could also require the company to stop selling  incorporating or using its products that use the infringed intellectual property  obtain a license to make  sell or use the relevant technology from the owner of the infringed intellectual property  which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  and redesign the company s products so as not to use the infringed intellectual property  which may not be technically or commercially feasible 
furthermore  the defense of infringement claims and lawsuits  regardless of their outcome  would likely be expensive to resolve and could require a significant portion of management s time 
in addition  rather than litigating an infringement matter  the company may determine that it is in the company s best interests to settle the matter 
terms of a settlement may include the payment of damages and the company s agreement to license technology in exchange for a license fee and ongoing royalties 
these fees could be substantial 
if the company were required to pay damages or otherwise became subject to such equitable remedies  its business  financial condition and results of operations would suffer 
similarly  if the company were required to pay license fees to third parties based on a successful infringement claim brought against it  such fees could exceed the company s revenue 
earthquakes and other natural disasters may damage the company s facilities or those of its suppliers 
the company s corporate headquarters in fremont  california is located near major earthquake faults that have experienced seismic activity 
in addition  some of the company s suppliers are located near fault lines 
in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster near its headquarters  the company s operations could be disrupted 
similarly  a major earthquake or other natural disaster near one or more of the company s major suppliers could adversely impact the operations of those suppliers  which could limit the supply of the company s products and harm its business 
the company s stock price is volatile 
the market price of the company s common stock has fluctuated significantly to date 
in the future  the market price of its common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to the company s anticipated or actual operating results  announcements or introductions of new products  technological innovations by the company or its competitors  product delays or setbacks by the company  its customers or its competitors  potential supply interruptions  concentration of sales among a small number of customers  conditions in the communications and semiconductor markets  
table of contents the commencement of litigation  changes in estimates of the company s performance by securities analysts  announcements of merger or acquisition transactions  and or general global economic and market conditions 
in the past  securities and class action litigation has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities 
the company may be the target of one or more of these class action suits  which could result in significant costs and divert management s attention  thereby harming the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of many high technology companies  including semiconductor companies  and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these fluctuations may harm the market price of the company s common stock 
the anti takeover provisions of the company s certificate of incorporation and of the delaware general corporation law may delay  defer or prevent a change of control 
the company s board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by its stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be harmed by  the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may delay  defer or prevent a change in control  as the terms of the preferred stock that might be issued could potentially prohibit the company s consummation of any merger  reorganization  sale of substantially all of its assets  liquidation or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of the holders of the outstanding shares of common stock 
in addition  the issuance of preferred stock could have a dilutive effect on the company s stockholders 
the company s stockholders must give days advance notice prior to any stockholders meeting at which a stockholder intends to nominate a candidate for director or present a proposal to the company s stockholders for approval 
these notice requirements could inhibit a takeover by delaying stockholder action 
the company has in place a stockholder rights plan  or poison pill  that may result in substantial dilution to a potential acquirer of the company in the event that the company s board of directors does not agree to an acquisition proposal 
the rights plan may make it more difficult and costly to acquire the company 
the delaware anti takeover law restricts business combinations with some stockholders once the stockholder acquires or more of the company s common stock 
the delaware statute makes it more difficult for the company to be acquired without the consent of its board of directors 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency fluctuations 
the company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations primarily through its foreign operations 
this exposure is the result of foreign operating expenses being denominated in foreign currency 
operational currency requirements are typically forecasted for a three month period 
if there is a need to hedge this risk  the company will enter into transactions to purchase currency in the open market or enter into forward currency exchange contracts 
while it is expected that this method of hedging foreign currency risk will be utilized in the future  the hedging methodology and or usage may be changed to manage exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
if the company s foreign operations forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  the company could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
for the fiscal year ended march   the company did not have significant foreign currency denominated net assets or net liabilities positions  and had no foreign currency contracts outstanding 
interest rate sensitivity 
the company maintains investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types  and maturity dates with various banks and investment banking institutions 
the market value of these investments on any given day during the investment term may vary as a result of market interest rate fluctuations 
this exposure is not hedged because a hypothetical movement in interest rates during the investment term would not likely have a material impact on investment income 
the actual impact on investment income in the future may differ materially from this analysis  depending on actual balances and changes in the timing and the amount of interest rate movements 
both short term and long term investments are classified as available for sale securities and the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
at march   short term investments consisted of auction rate securities  government and corporate securities of million and long term investments consisted of government and corporate securities of million 
at march   the difference between the fair market value and the underlying cost of such investments was  the company s net income is dependent on  amongst other factors  interest income and realized gains from the sale of marketable investments 
if interest rates continue to decline or the company is not able to realize gains from the sale of marketable securities  the company s net income may be negatively impacted
