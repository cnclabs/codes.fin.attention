item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies the company s management considers the following accounting policies to be critical to the reported operations of the company 
real estate properties during the industrial development stage  costs associated with development ie  land  construction costs  interest expense during construction  property taxes and indirect costs associated with development are aggregated into the total capitalization of the property 
included in these costs are management s estimates for the portions of internal costs primarily personnel costs that are deemed directly or indirectly related to such development activities 
because the estimation of capitalizable internal costs requires management s judgment  the company believes internal cost capitalization is a critical accounting estimate 
the company reviews its real estate investments to be held and used for impairment of value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if any real estate investment is considered permanently impaired  a loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value 
real estate assets to be sold are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
the evaluation of real estate investments involves many subjective assumptions dependent upon future economic events that affect the ultimate value of the property 
currently  the company s management is not aware of any impairment issues nor has it experienced any significant impairment issues in recent years 
valuation of receivables the company is subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables 
in order to mitigate these risks  the company performs credit review and analysis on prospective tenants before significant leases are executed 
the company evaluates outstanding receivables and estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts 
management specifically analyzes historical bad debts  aged receivables  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company believes that its allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate for its outstanding receivables at december  and tax status eastgroup  a maryland corporation  has qualified as a real estate investment trust under sections of the internal revenue code and intends to continue to qualify as such 
to maintain its status as a reit  the company is required to distribute of its ordinary taxable income to its stockholders 
the company has the option of i paying out capital gains to the stockholders with no tax to the company  or ii treating the capital gains as having been distributed to the stockholders  paying the tax on the gain deemed distributed and allocating the tax paid as a credit to the stockholders 
the company distributed all of its  and taxable income to its stockholders 
accordingly  no provision for income taxes was necessary

property net operating income pnoi from real estate properties  defined as income from real estate operations reo less property operating expenses before interest expense and depreciation and amortization is a supplemental industry reporting measurement used to evaluate the performance of the company s investments in real estate assets 
the company believes that the exclusion of depreciation and amortization in the industry s calculation of pnoi provides a supplemental indicator of the properties performance since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions 
pnoi as calculated by the company may not be comparable to similarly titled but differently calculated measures for other reits 
the major factors that influence pnoi are occupancy levels  acquisitions and sales  development properties that achieve stabilized operations  rental rate increases or decreases  and the recoverability of operating expenses 
the company s success depends largely upon its ability to lease warehouse space and to recover from tenants the operating costs associated with those leases 
reo income is comprised of rental income including straight line rent adjustments  pass through income and other reo income  which includes termination fees 
property operating expenses are comprised of insurance  property taxes  repair and maintenance expenses  management fees and other operating costs 
generally  the company s most significant operating expenses are insurance and property taxes 
tenant leases may be net leases in which the total operating expenses are recoverable  modified gross leases in which some of the operating expenses are recoverable  or gross leases in which no expenses are recoverable gross leases represent a small portion of the company s total leases 
increases in property operating expenses are fully recoverable under net leases and recoverable to a high degree under modified gross leases 
modified gross leases often include base year amounts and expense increases over these amounts are recoverable 
the company s exposure to property operating expenses is primarily due to vacancies and leases for occupied space that limit the amount of expenses that can be recoverable 
pnoi from continuing operations decreased by  or for compared to pnoi by property type and percentage leased for industrial were as follows property net operating income years ended percent december  leased in thousands industrial   other   total pnoi   pnoi from industrial properties decreased  for compared to industrial properties held throughout and showed a decrease in pnoi of 
the decrease in pnoi results mainly from a decrease in the company s portfolio average occupancy during the year primarily due to a continued slowing of the economy and the unusually high percentage of leases that expired in the last two years 
also  lease termination fees were only  in compared to  in in addition  real estate operating expenses increased  in compared to this increase was primarily due to increases in insurance  property taxes and bad debt expense

inflation in the last five years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rate in the company s geographic areas of operation 
most of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  the company s leases typically have three to five year terms  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at a higher base if rents on the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its lines of credit and long term debt maturities 
this debt is used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the company s real estate investment portfolio and operations 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  the company borrows at fixed rates but also has several variable rate bank lines as discussed under liquidity and capital resources 
the table below presents the principal payments due and weighted average interest rates for both the fixed rate and variable rate debt 
fair thereafter total value fixed rate debt in thousands         weighted average interest rate variable rate debt in thousands     weighted average interest rate the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for similar issues or by discounting expected cash flows at the rates currently offered to the company for debt of the same remaining maturities  as advised by the company s bankers 
as the table above incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
the company s ultimate economic impact with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and interest rates 
if the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate bank debt as shown above changes by or approximately basis points  interest expense and cash flows would increase or decrease by approximately  annually 
in november  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge its exposure to the variable interest rate on the company s  tower automotive center recourse mortgage

this swap is designated as a cash flow hedge and is considered to be fully effective in hedging the variable rate risk associated with the tower mortgage loan 
changes in the fair value of the swap are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the company does not hold or issue this type of derivative contract for trading or speculative purposes
