item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except share data overview economy the year faced its own challenges as the economy began its slow recovery 
the threat of war with iraq kept consumers spending more conservatively  corporations holding back on expansion  and americans watching as fuel prices increased 
at its november meeting  the federal reserve bank  concerned with the slow recovery and the need for a stimulus  dropped the discount rate basis points to 
this was the only change in rates for the year 
the federal funds rate followed the basis point decline  falling to with the prime interest rate changing from to 
on the national front  growth in gross domestic product gdp ranged from in the first quarter to 
for the fourth quarter 
consumer sentiment was down from earlier months in the year as it dropped from a high of in may to a low of in october 
the index ended the year at the unemployment rate  fluctuating between and  ended the year at as major corporations continued to lay off workers 
a positive sign of the recovery was the industrial production growth 
while the nation experienced negative growth during the first half of the year  production rebounded to by the end of in addition  the institute for supply management ism index improved to  up from prior months of approximately this factor s importance lies in its measurement of whether the economy is growing or contracting 
a ratio of or greater is indicative of a growing economy 
still lagging  however  was the capital utilization that hovered around 
this is indicative of slow corporate spending on plant and equipment until the economy improves and sales volumes rise 
while the economy of north mississippi is diversified  furniture manufacturing is an important element 
by the end of  housing starts  permits  and new home sales were up 
normally  furniture orders follow the housing market 
the major housing growth areas for the company are located in lee and desoto counties 
unemployment rates within our market ranged from to approximately at year end 
the unemployment rates  where we have our largest presence  are currently below the national average 
lee county  the corporate headquarters for the company  as well as surrounding counties  saw a increase in both manufacturing and non manufacturing jobs during in addition  we are located in two of the top five retail markets in mississippi  with sales up

it is expected that growth for will be and  respectively  for those counties 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared using accounting estimates for various accounts 
wherever feasible  we utilize third party information to provide management with estimates 
although independent third parties are utilized to assist us in the estimation process  management evaluates the results  and challenges assumptions used and other factors which could impact the estimation 
following are some of the more significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements 
the critical accounting policy that is most important to the presentation of our financial statements relates to the allowance for loan loss and related provision

property values are assessed periodically for impairment 
our health insurance administrator is blue cross blue shield

we maintain an accrued liability that includes estimated claims to be paid 
the accrued liability account is evaluated at year end for adequacy using a lag analysis provided by the administrator 
this data is used to calculate an estimated amount to be paid for during william m 
mercer  inc prepares actuarial valuations of our pension cost under fasb statement no 
 as modified by fasb statement no 
 and our post retirement health cost under fasb statement no 
the discount rate used in the valuation was  down from in actual plan assets as of december  were used in the calculation and the expected long term return on plan assets assumed for this valuation was 
the pension plan covered under fasb statement no 
was curtailed as of december  we currently have a defined contribution pension plan  which requires the company to contribute of each qualified employee s salary to the plan 
the accrual for that plan is based on actual qualified salaries for the k expense was calculated in the same manner 
we believe we employ appropriate methods for these calculations that should closely approximate the actual cost 
we review the calculated results for reasonableness  and compare those calculations to prior period costs 
we also consider the effect of current economic conditions on the calculations 
performance results record results were achieved in as earnings per share increased over earnings per share before the cumulative effect of an accounting change improved over the significant factor contributing to the improvement is the effort dedicated to implementing and monitoring our strategic plan 
through our strategic plan  the management team laid the foundation for improving credit quality  raising net interest margin  controlling noninterest expenses  increasing noninterest income  and capital management 
despite the low interest rates and generally sluggish economic environment  we employed strategies to improve net interest income 
those strategies included a proactive approach to pricing of both assets and liabilities  continued restructuring of our investment portfolio  and pursuit of loan growth 
in the first quarter of  the company completed the transitional impairment test required by fasb statement no 
 goodwill and intangible assets 
as a result of this test  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the company identified its reporting units as banking operations and insurance operations for purposes of measuring impairment of goodwill 
the insurance operations are a wholly owned subsidiary of the bank 
the impairment was specific to the insurance subsidiary 
the fair value of the insurance reporting unit was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
because the insurance subsidiary acquisition was a tax free exchange  there was no tax offset to the impairment cost recorded 
the annual impairment test updated as of december   indicated no additional impairment 
net income before the cumulative effect of the accounting change was approximately greater than projected in the strategic plan 
in addition  we increased our net interest and noninterest income and  respectively  over while noninterest expense increased  largely attributable to normal salary increases  incentive bonuses  health insurance  pension costs  professional fees  and depreciation costs associated with technology  the net overhead ratio noninterest expense less noninterest income  all divided by average assets declined from in to in a historical look at key performance indicators is presented below

roe amounts above exclude cumulative effect of accounting change 
including this effect  eps  roa roe were   and  respectively 
eps growth reflects changes from the immediately preceding year 
total assets increased to  at december   up over the prior year  primarily from loans and securities 
moderate growth in deposits and capital  along with a higher volume of debt  funded this growth 
the company has an ongoing stock repurchase program under which  shares were purchased during at an average price of per share 
the closing price of a single share of common stock on the american stock exchange was on december   an increase of over the price at december  and an increase of over the closing price at december  results of operations net interest income  the difference between interest earned on assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities  is the largest component of our net income  comprising of total revenue 
the primary concerns in managing net interest income are the mix and the repricing of rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
we have experienced marked improvement in this area over the course of the last two years for several reasons 
first and foremost was the asset liability management committee s assertiveness in making pricing decisions to enhance net interest income 
further enhancing net interest margin was the effect of changing the mix in our investment portfolio that began in and continued in finally  we increased our emphasis on loan growth as a result of recognizing that we must improve our loan to deposit ratio in order to become a high performing bank 
we added two seasoned lenders to our team in the desoto county market  located in the memphis msa  and two in the lee county tupelo market 
one of the new employees in the desoto county market will be working in the capacity as an advisor to all our lenders in that area to improve our market share 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased  or  from  in to  in of the tax equivalent increase   was due to the favorable growth in net earning assets with an increase of  due to changes in interest rates 
the tax equivalent yield on earnings decreased from to  or basis points 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased from in to in  or basis points 
the improvement in net interest income was directly attributable to both the asset liability committee s approach to proactively pricing its earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the negative gap position of those assets and liabilities 
as interest bearing deposits and loans were repriced  the asset liability committee carefully monitored the effect of that repricing 
during  we had more rate sensitive liabilities being repriced than assets which enhanced margin in the falling rate environment 
growth in public fund transaction accounts  coupled with federal home loan bank borrowings  provided the majority of growth in funding for throughout the last two years  as time deposits matured  many clients have chosen to move their funds to more liquid deposit accounts as rates have fallen to a year low 
this resulted in a decrease of million in time deposits from december  to december   and a more dramatic million decrease in the average balance of time deposits for compared to net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased  or  from  in to  in of the tax equivalent change  was due to the favorable growth in net earning assets with an increase of  due to changes in interest rates 
the tax equivalent yield on earning assets was down from to  or basis points 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities dropped from in to in  or basis points 
the decline in rates was directly attributable to the fed s moves  and the asset liability committee s approach to proactively pricing its earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in contrast to  growth in transaction and money market accounts  coupled with federal home loan bank borrowings  provided the majority of growth in funding 
average earning assets to total average assets average earning assets as a percentage of total average assets are shown above for a five year period 
the decrease in was attributable to the purchase of  of bank owned life insurance boli mid year of boli is classified as nonearning and included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
if the boli had been purchased at the beginning of  the earning asset ratio for would have been approximately 
the improvement for over the adjusted ratio of is attributable in part to cash management 
the tax equivalent yields on earning assets were   and  for   and  respectively 
net interest margin tax equivalent net interest margin  the tax equivalent net yield on earning assets  increased basis points during over the comparable period in the prior year 
the increase was due in part to many changes made in such as an improvement in risk based pricing on loans and changing the mix of the investment portfolio 
the asset liability management committee continued to be assertive in setting rates 
in addition  the percent of average time deposits to average total deposits decreased from in to in of the portfolio  reducing interest expense that would have offset interest income by shifting funds to less costly accounts 
further enhancing net interest margin was the growth in loans  the company s highest yielding asset 
net interest margin  the tax equivalent net yield on earning assets  increased basis points during over the comparable period in the prior year 
an improvement in risk based pricing on loans  a change in the mix of the investment portfolio  and an assertive approach to pricing funding sources resulted in the increase 
net interest margin was down basis points for from the comparable period in the prior year 
during the last decade  the company s net interest margin had generally been above peer banks  however  during as deposit costs rose  the margin declined to the peer average 
the trend of a falling margin was due to interest rate changes and intense competition from other banks and non banks 
loans and loan interest income loans are the most significant earning asset comprising  and of total assets at december    and  respectively 
the table below sets forth loans outstanding  according to loan type  net of unearned income  at december loan portfolio commercial  financial  agricultural      lease financing      real estate construction      real estate mortgage      installment loans to individuals      total loans net of unearned income      despite the sluggish economy  total loans increased from  to  or during the most significant increase occurred in the second half of  due in part to the hiring of lending staff in the desoto and lee county markets 
consumer loans decreased approximately  during  largely attributable to the curtailment of the sales finance division that occurred in this was approximately  for and  for the average loan to deposit ratio was for as shown below 
in order to improve net interest margin and net interest income  our strategic plan includes raising our loan to deposit ratio to by december progress toward this goal is noted in the actual loan to deposit ratio at december  of 
new loans recorded in totaled  of which were secured by real estate 
average loan to deposit ratio loans increased from  in to  in  or 
commercial loans  specifically first mortgage commercial real estate  provided the majority of the growth  up 
first mortgage residential loans experienced growth as well  but on a more moderate basis 
during  we sold approximately  in student loans  and curtailed the sales finance division indirect lending  reducing the loan growth to 
mortgage loans grew over and were the major growth sector 
despite interest rate increases and the sale of approximately  in credit card loans  loan growth in was over the most significant percentage increase loans occurred in real estate construction and mortgages 
managing the interest rate risk of the loan portfolio has been a challenge during the last two years with rates dropping to unprecedented lows 
prime was reduced eleven times during and once more in november  falling from at december  to at december  as in  clients continued to request financing with extended terms in the low interest rate environment 
we employed the use of federal home loan bank borrowings to match fund loans where terms were extended for clients  primarily larger commercial and real estate loans 
average yields on loans decreased from in to in  and then to in the most significant changes occurred in commercial loans as the average yield dropped from in to in  and to in consumer loan yields actually increased from in to in  then declined to in the increase in our consumer loan yield for was attributable to improvements made in risk based pricing of our loans 
the tax equivalent loan interest income was   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the tax equivalent loan interest income decreased  or in from fostered by the low interest rate environment 
coupled with this low interest rate environment was the slight change in the mix of the loan portfolio 
in  we experienced a decrease in higher yielding consumer loans of  with approximately  due to the decrease in the sales finance division 
tax equivalent loan interest income decreased  or in from  again  primarily due to rate decreases 
for  loan volume and pricing accounted for increases in income of  and  respectively 
the tax equivalent yield on those loans was up basis points to

fhlb and other preferred stock in  securities income on a tax equivalent basis increased over securities income on a tax equivalent basis in the average balance in the investment portfolio was up  or 
the tax equivalent yield on the portfolio was  down basis points from during  and as well  we made a number of changes in our investment portfolio 
as treasury securities matured  the funds from the maturities were invested in mortgage backed and agency securities 
at december  the company had no treasury securities 
in  we changed our investment policy to allow us to increase our position in mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
mortgage backed securities and cmos were the primary investments purchased in with of investments coming from this sector 
of the growth in this sector  approximately  of gnma securities was funded by federal home loan bank funds  providing a spread on the arbitrage of 
the use of this sector of securities has allowed us to increase our cash flow going forward providing funds for loan growth as well as opportunities for repricing as rates begin to rise 
in addition  mortgage backed securities have a higher yield than treasury and agency securities 
other growth for has come from u 
s 
obligations of government agencies  and obligations of states and political subdivisions that provide both securities for meeting pledging requirements of municipalities and favorable tax treatment 
in addition  we purchased both fixed and variable trust preferred securities to enhance our yield 
for  securities interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased over securities income over a tax equivalent basis in the average balance in the investment portfolio was up  or 
the tax equivalent yield on the portfolio was  down one basis point from the prior year 
in the first quarter of  we changed policy criteria for holding certain types of securities 
not deviating from soundness  in  we reinvested the majority of maturing government securities into mortgage backed securities to enhance both yield and cash flow 
in addition  at the beginning of  we adopted fasb no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and made the decision under the opinion to reclassify all securities held to maturity to available for sale 
this reclassification provided more flexibility in managing the investment portfolio  particularly in this low interest rate environment 
deposits and deposit interest expense the company relies on deposits as its major source of funds 
deposits funded  and of total assets at december   and  respectively 
total deposits were   and  as of december   and  respectively 
deposit growth for was  an improvement over the growth of 
noninterest bearing deposits were   and  at december   and  respectively  and funded  and of total assets at those dates 
the average balance for was up  over while the average balance for was up over that of noninterest bearing accounts grew most significantly in the free checking  personal  and over accounts in both and in  we also saw significant increases in prime time accounts and small business accounts  both which were targeted in various promotions 
in recognition of our shareholders on going support  we made a special offer of free checking for life with their participation in our dividend reinvestment plan in average interest bearing deposits to total average deposits interest bearing deposits at december    and were   and  respectively 
growth for was  primarily due to public funds 
time deposits were down at december  approximately  to  compared to december  the balances in the you can t lose time deposits were up  over balances at december  the you can t lose deposit type  which allows the client one rate increase during the term of the deposit  has been a popular product during last the two years 
in  growth remained flat as clients looked for higher yielding alternatives 
as the federal funds rate dropped during the year  rates paid on all types of interest bearing transaction accounts and time deposits followed 
by the end of  market rates paid on these accounts ranged from to while time deposit rates ranged from to 
offsetting the low growth in deposits was a record year in annuity sales in of approximately  up from approximately  in this product proved to be the right alternative for many of our clients since the stock market was in a downturn and interest rates on deposit accounts had fallen significantly 
interest bearing deposits increased during  principally from certificates of deposit 
during  we offered a number of deposit specials that were attractive to our client base  particularly in certificates of deposit 
this offering was the result from the highly competitive market for deposits 
loan demand was high early in  fueling the need for banks to raise deposits to support loan growth 
our average time deposit balance as a percent of average total deposits moved from in to in while showed improvement in net interest income  only a portion of the time deposits had been repriced 
many of those higher rate specials offered in had one year terms or greater so  while we began to get some relief in  there were still many time deposits that did not reprice until late and early the ratio of average time deposits to average total deposits was in  comparable to the level 
interest expense for deposits was   and  for   and  respectively 
the cost of interest bearing deposits was   and for the same periods 
borrowed funds and interest expense on borrowings advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
advances from the fhlb were up and over the prior year balances in and  respectively 
as rates fell to year lows in and remained at those levels until falling another basis points in november   both consumer and commercial loan clients were refinancing at lower rates with extended maturities 
in order to offset this interest rate risk  funds were borrowed from the federal home loan bank to match fund those loans  negating interest rate exposure when rates rise 
such match funded loans are usually large commercial or real estate loans 
as discussed earlier  the company set up an arbitrage  funding the purchase of mortgage backed securities with fhlb funds 
the total borrowed for the arbitrage was  with a weighted average interest rate of 
the weighted average maturity and rate of total funds borrowed from the federal home loan bank in   and was months with an average cost of  months with an average cost of  and months with an average cost of  respectively 
the treasury tax and loan account balances for   and were   and  respectively 
the balance in this account is contingent on the amount of funds we pledge as collateral as well as the federal reserve s need for funds 
interest expense on total borrowings inclusive of advances from the federal home loan bank and treasury tax and loan was  in  up from  in due to increased borrowing which more than offset the decline in interest rates 
interest expense in was  less than the expense for due to both lower rates and a decrease in average borrowed funds 
toward the end of  more reliance was placed on borrowed funds 
the balance in borrowed funds for  including the treasury tax and loan account and loans from the federal home loan bank  was up  or 
the average balances of borrowed funds were   and  for   and  respectively 
interest expense was up from  in to  in the cost of those funds in was  down from in provision for loan losses to average loans the provision for loan losses was   and  for   and  respectively 
despite a recession during the year and a notable lack of recovery in  loan quality improved as both net charge offs and non performing loans decreased first during  and again during during and  the most significant charge offs were from real estate mortgage loans  which comprise approximately of our loan portfolio 
consumer loan charge offs improved from the prior year for both and due to the curtailment of the sales finance division 
during  we experienced deterioration in credit quality for both commercial and mortgage loans 
however  the largest growth in net charge offs was from consumer loans  particularly in the sales finance loans 
noninterest income less securities gains losses to average assets ratio does not include the gain on the sale of the credit card portfolio 
in  there was much emphasis placed on our existing client base 
while we did not expand our market territory  we made changes aimed at increasing our share of our current market 
rather than introduce new product lines  we developed plans directed at selling our existing products  with emphasis on our seniors and prime time gold programs aimed at attracting the more affluent market 
we conducted over fifty events throughout our market area for this group in the events included health fairs as well as programs on topics such as fraud  street smarts  identity theft  estate planning  long term care  medicare supplements  wealth management  and retirement fundamentals 
in addition  we published and mailed a quarterly newsletter for both clients and non clients in this segment of our market 
we have noted an increase in services provided and in new clients as a result of these programs 
we expect future growth from these programs over the next two to five years 
total noninterest income includes fees generated from deposit services  loan services  insurance products  trust and other wealth management products and services  security gains  and all other non interest income 
we made significant improvement in enhancing our noninterest income during both and noninterest income for was  up  over for a growth rate of 
noninterest income for outpaced by  or 
noninterest income represented  and of total revenue for   and  respectively 
during both and  management continued to work at the implementation of our strategic plan  particularly in the services offered and fees assessed 
the successful completion of theses initiatives has resulted in substantial growth for both years 
as an extension of our strategic plan  our franchises developed their own vision and mission statements  and business plans for achieving their goals 
those plans include specific programs for fostering additional client relationships 
the execution of this program has resulted in greater sales not only in service charge revenue  but also other fees as well 
in  fees generated from deposit services increased  or over the additional income generated was derived primarily from service charges on deposit accounts including overdraft fees  fees earned from use of our debit cards inclusive of interchange fees  and fees generated through our merchant business 
only minor changes were made to the fee structure on deposit account products during for  fees generated from deposit services increased  or over the restructuring of fees on selected transaction accounts and account activity provided the growth 
some administrative fees were assessed to cover the cost of handling client accounts such as returned bank statements and return items 
fees earned from loan services in were  or greater than fees earned in fees associated with originating loans were restructured at the end of the first quarter of in order to help offset operating costs associated with offering loan products 
the new fee structure is tiered both on commercial and consumer loans and based on loan size 
in  we added origination and closing fees on both commercial and consumer loans 
this fee is tiered  and the charge depends on the size of the credit 
the increase in fees attributable to the restructured fees and additional loan volume was approximately in addition  the income in includes in a prepayment penalty on a loan that was funded through the federal home loan bank 
finally  income on the sale of mortgage loans remained strong in due to both the originating and refinancing of approximately  in mortgage loans 
while the gains on mortgage loans were up moderately over  the amortization of mortgage servicing rights was up  or over we recorded additional impairment of during the fourth quarter of related to prepayments on the mortgage loans being serviced by the company 
in contrast to the past  most mortgage loans originated are sold with servicing released 
the company  however  still services approximately  in loans originated prior to fees earned from loan services for were  or  greater than document preparation fees  mortgage loan fees and gains on sales of mortgage loans were the main contributors to the increase 
the mortgage loan business gained momentum during as rates fell to unprecedented lows 
in  we experienced a decrease in fees generated from mortgage originations of approximately  primarily due to interest rates 
income earned on insurance products increased or   or  and  or in   and  respectively 
we implemented an insurance integration plan in aimed at improving our cross selling performance between the bank and the insurance company and continue to use and refine that plan 
a secondary benefit resulting from increased sales is the opportunity to improve contingency income 
contingency income is a bonus received from the insurance underwriters and is based both on commission income and claims experience on our clients during the previous year 
the change in income for insurance products in includes an increase of for contingency income 
our financial services division encompasses trust services  annuities and mutual funds  and specialized insurance products for business and estate secession 
a manager was placed over this division in with the responsibility of fostering growth through building client relationships 
the team was assembled at the end of in  the revenue generated by this division decreased  or 
revenue from mutual fund and annuity sales decreased trust revenue was up in over  offsetting some of the decrease from other products 
the increase in trust revenue was attributable to new accounts as well as an additional basis points received on accounts from our money manager 
the renegotiation of the rate received from our money manager occurred mid year 
income for this division for was  or  greater than the prior year due to mutual fund and annuity sales 
trust revenue in declined  or from the previous year 
the reduction was due to the loss in value of the trust assets under management 
as the stock market declined  the value of the trust accounts decreased 
fees charged by the trust division are based  in part  on the value of the assets in the trust accounts 
cash surrender value earned on bank owned life insurance boli in was greater than that earned in due to the period that boli was held by the company 
we purchased  in boli in late may for the purpose of offsetting the rising cost of health insurance 
boli income earned in was a death benefit of approximately was received during on a participant in the company s deferred compensation plan 
also  cash surrender value earned on life insurance purchased through the bank s deferred compensation plan in was approximately less than  the income recorded in was approximately greater than that recorded in both items discussed above were classified as other income 
securities gains of for resulted from  in security sales 
these were primarily mortgage backed securities that were sold to eliminate those securities with maturity concentrations or accelerated prepayments 
sales also included securities in the agency  obligation of state and political subdivision  and other preferred stock sectors 
securities gains of for resulted from  in security sales 
these securities included odd lot mortgage backed securities  preferred stock  and collateralized mortgage obligations 
the proceeds from these funds were used to reinvest in other mortgage backed securities and to fund bank owned life insurance 
noninterest expense to average assets total noninterest expense includes salaries and employee benefits  data processing  net occupancy  equipment  and other noninterest expense 
noninterest expense was   and  for   and  respectively 
noninterest expense increased   and for   and  respectively 
salaries and employee benefits represent  and of total noninterest expenses at december    and  respectively 
as a percent of net interest and noninterest income  salaries and employee benefits were  and for the years   and  respectively 
salaries and employee benefits cost for increased  over salaries for increased  or  over due to normal annual salary increases and staff additions 
the additions occurred in the two fastest growing markets of the company  desoto and lee counties  and were primarily lending staff to enhance the company s loan growth 
incentive cost in increased  or  over as a result of the improvement in the company s performance 
commission expense in was  or  greater than due to the additional revenue generated through insurance  mortgage and merchant sales 
our insurance producers  mortgage originators and merchant representatives are paid primarily on a commission basis 
in addition  health and life insurance cost was  or  greater than the increase in health and life insurance is due to the rising cost of insurance as well as increased claims filed for retirement plan cost in was greater than due to the increase in the company s match for the k plan as well as cost associated with the defined contribution plan 
for  salaries and employee benefits were up  or over regular salaries and insurance commissions were up and  respectively in the size of both increases is due primarily to normal salary increases  the timing of adding insurance agencies and the opening of new banking facilities during employee overtime continued to drop from prior year levels  offsetting a part of the increase 
the most significant change in salaries and benefits came from the incentive plan  up  and related employment taxes 
there was no incentive expense for increases in other costs including health insurance  pension  post retirement benefits  and esop funding contributed to the growth 
data processing cost for was up  or  over the increase is attributable to volume for our merchant business as well as services with our core service provider 
the upgrade of our deposit platform system increased cost  as did the implementation of a new consumer internet banking platform 
in addition  a new loan platform system will be installed in the first quarter of in  data processing expenses increased  or  over during  we installed a teller platform system purchased from our core service provider  metavante 
while costs related to the use of this system increased  other costs decreased such as other losses and charge offs as cash and fraud losses dissipated 
occupancy expense in was down from due largely to the sale of a building in january  occupancy expense in was up a modest  or  over this change was due to an increase in depreciation for buildings and furniture  janitorial costs  and utilities 
these costs were partially offset by decreases in rent expense and building supplies  and the recognition of a loss on the sale of a building during computer and equipment expenses have increased   and over the prior year expense for the years   and  respectively 
these increases resulted from computer and software depreciation  maintenance and support fees 
we have made several technological enhancements during and including the installation of a teller platform system  and upgrading both our deposit platform system and the credit scoring module 
we also upgraded data storage to a robotic dvd device  providing near on line access to data check images  and purchased software to enhance read rates in item processing 
these upgrades have enhanced productivity  reduced losses  and provided better service for our clients 
we have noted improvement in both cash short and losses and charge offs as a result of the teller platform and deposit platform systems 
we are in the process of implementing a new loan platform system  which will be operational in the first quarter of additionally  information security has been enhanced through software  hardware  and retention of services by experts in that field 
it has been  and will continue to be  our practice to seek technological improvements  to evaluate the benefits  and to progress with implementation of systems that are deemed beneficial for our clients and shareholders 
this practice is directly influenced by our vision to be the financial services advisor and provider of choice in the communities we serve 
as noted  the increase in computer and equipment expense for and is less than the increase for in  we experienced an increase in depreciation largely attributable to assets purchased in december the largest additions included the wide area network  document imaging software  and credit scoring software 
due to the specifications of the software  a significant investment was also made in microcomputers 
other noninterest expense in was  up  over increases were noted in public relations due largely to sponsorship of a hospice house  contribution to future focus  and the publication of a newsletter for senior citizens 
telephone and data line cost increased due to enhancements made in our call center and upgrades to either k data lines or t data lines at most locations for enhanced efficiency 
other fees also increased due to fees paid to consultants based on revenue enhancements generated from implementing their recommendations and fees paid to information technology consultants specificially to address our strategic technology plan  infrastructure including network assessment  and security 
other insurance expense  other than building and auto  increased over decreases in include oreo expense  down due to impairment recorded in of  other losses and charge offs down from  and intangible amortization down from as a result of compliance with fasb statement no 
the company will continue to amortize an intangible originating from a purchase in compliance with fasb statement no 
all other intangible assets will be evaluated periodically for impairment based on the present value of future cash flows 
remaining relatively flat for  other noninterest expense in decreased  or  over increases recorded included the recognition of impairment on other real estate owned  mortgage fees  intangible amortization  postage expense  and title insurance cost 
these increases were offset by reductions in travel  dues  fees  marketing  telephone  stationery and supplies 
efficiency ratio our efficiency ratio continues to improve from prior year levels 
this ratio is a standard performance measurement tool which encompasses tax equivalent net interest income  noninterest income excluding security gains and noninterest expense 
the increase in tax equivalent net interest income and noninterest income  less security gains continue to provide the catalyst for the improvement 
tax equivalent net interest income has improved as the result of proactive pricing decisions made by our asset liability committee as well as strategic structuring of cash flow from investments and borrowed funds 
we have also benefited from being in the position of repricing liabilities faster than assets in the rate environment we have been operating under 
noninterest income has improved due to our offering of new products as well as acquiring new clients 
as evidenced in our slogan more than a bank  we have expanded our product line from traditional banking services to a full line of financial services including insurance products  financial planning  investments and fiduciary services 
noninterest expenses in  while up over  were more than offset by the improvement in revenue 
while we emphasized operating expense control  we also recognized that additional cost was necessary in order to expand our product line and improve our level of service 
as the efficiency ratios above show  the additional cost incurred by the company over the last five years was more than offset by the additional revenue generated

risk management the management of risk is an on going process 
primary risks that are associated with the company include credit  interest rate  and liquidity risks 
credit risk inherent in any lending activity is credit risk  that is  the risk of loss should a borrower or trading counter party default 
credit risk is monitored and managed by a loan committee and a loss management committee 
credit quality and policies are major concerns of these committees 
we try to maintain diversification within our loan portfolio in order to minimize the effect of economic conditions within a particular industry 
the allowance for loan losses is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire loan portfolio 
the appropriate level of the allowance is based on a quarterly analysis of the loan portfolio and represents an amount that management deems adequate to provide for inherent losses  including collective impairment as recognized under fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the collective impairment is calculated based on loans grouped by grade 
another component of the allowance is losses on loans assessed as impaired under sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the balance of these loans determined as impaired under fasb statement no 
and their related allowance is included in management s estimation and analysis of the allowance for loan losses 
other considerations in establishing the allowance for loan losses include economic conditions reflected within industry segments  unemployment rate in our market  loan segmentation  and historical losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio 
if the allowance is deemed inadequate  management provides additional reserves through the provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses was  and  at december  and  respectively 
allowance for loan losses to loans the net charge offs for and were  and  respectively 
below is a chart showing net charge offs as a percent of total net charge offs by each category 
charge offs and recovery amounts by loan category are presented on page net charge offs commercial  financial  agricultural 
lease financing real estate construction real estate mortgage installment loans to individuals total net charge offs higher credit standards resulted in lower net charge offs for of  or from for  the most significant change in net charge offs was in the consumer loan sector  which decreased  or from this improvement was primarily due to the sales finance loans that continued to decrease  losses in sales finance loans decreased from net charge offs in real estate mortgage loans in were up  or  primarily due to the increased loan volume in that sector of  or 
net charge offs for commercial  financial and agricultural and real estate construction loans were relatively unchanged from loan losses for were significantly below  dropping  or  commercial loan and consumer loan net charge offs decreased and  respectively  in the majority of the consumer loans charged off in both and were in used automobiles and sales finance loans 
net charge offs for in real estate mortgage and real estate construction loans were in line with net charge offs from those categories in the charge offs in real estate mortgage loans for both and consisted of older credits comprised of family and nonfarm residential properties 
these losses resulted from poor underwriting 
during  we enhanced our underwriting criteria by implementing higher credit standards  by evaluating loan officer credit limits  and by more closely evaluating real estate appraisals 
management continues to monitor loans and utilize diligent collection efforts 
net charge offs to average loans nonperforming loans are those on which the accrual of interest has stopped or the loans are contractually past due days 
generally  the accrual of income is discontinued when the full collection of principal or interest is in doubt  or when the payment of principal or interest has been contractually days past due  unless the obligation is both well secured and in the process of collection 
during  we continued to refine the credit scoring process that was implemented in toward the end of the year  formalized underwriting standards for small business loans were implemented 
the credit scoring is used as a tool for evaluating credit risk and is proving itself as an effective tool 
management has recognized the improvement in loan quality as loans are being scored 
we have a number of documented loan policies and procedures that set forth the approval and monitoring process of the lending function 
adherence to these policies and procedures is mandated by management and the board of directors 
the company operates a number of committees and an underwriting staff that oversee the lending operation 
those include in house loan and loss management committees  and a board of directors loan committee 
in addition  we maintain a loan review staff 
the underwriters review and score loan requests that are made by our lending staff 
in compliance with policy  the lending staff is given lending limits based on their knowledge and experience 
in addition  each lending officer s prior performance is evaluated for credit quality and compliance as a tool for establishing and enhancing lending limits 
before funds are advanced  loans are scored by the underwriters 
grades are assigned based on the scoring of the loans that are funded 
this information is used to assist management in monitoring the credit quality 
loan requests of amounts greater than the officers lending limits are reviewed by an in house loan committee 
this committee is comprised of executive management 
decisions on funding loan requests are made or declined at this level provided they are within approved lending limits 
loan requests that exceed this group s lending authority are submitted to a loan committee comprised of members of the board of directors 
the allowance for loan losses is established after input from management  loan review  and the loss management committee 
an evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on the types of loans  the credit risk in the portfolio  economic conditions and trends within each of these factors 
the loss management committee monitors loans that are past due or those that have been downgraded due to a decline in the collateral value or cash flow of the debtor 
foreclosure proceedings are initiated after all collection efforts have failed and the sale of the collateral has resulted in a deficiency balance 
loans that have a deficiency balance are sent to the loan committee comprised of the board of directors for charge off approval 
these charge offs reduce the allowance for loan losses 
all loans are classified into grades by lending personnel 
these grades are used in the calculation for the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
loan grades range between and  with being loans with the least credit risk 
allowance factors established by management are applied to each grade to determine the amount needed in the allowance for loan losses 
loan review personnel monitor the grades assigned to loans through periodic examination 
the allowance factors are established based on our loss experience  adjusted for trends and expectations about losses inherent in our existing portfolios  as well as regulatory guidelines for criticized loans 
for impaired loans  a specific reserve is established to adjust the carrying value of the loan to its fair value 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is calculated quarterly 
these calculations are reviewed by management and the internal loan review staff 
if the allowance is deemed inadequate  management increases the allowance by a charge to the provision for loan losses 
on a monthly basis  management and the board of directors review loan ratios 
these ratios include the loan to deposit ratio  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans  net charge offs as a percentage of average loans  the provision for loan losses as a percentage of average loans  nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans  and the allowance coverage on nonperforming loans 
in addition  management reviews past due ratios by officer  community bank  and company

when evaluating nonaccrual and restructured loans  the interest income foregone and recognized from through was not significant 
restructured loans are those for which concessions have been granted to the borrower due to a deterioration of the borrower s financial condition 
such concessions may include reduction in interest rates  or deferral of interest or principal payments 
real estate acquired through the satisfaction of loan indebtedness oreo is recorded at the lower of cost or fair market value based on appraised value  less estimated selling costs 
any deficiency between the loan balance and the purchase price of the property is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent sales of the property may result in gains or losses

management believes the most significant impact on financial results stems from our ability to react to changes in interest rates 
therefore  we are constantly monitoring our rate sensitivity 
we have an asset liability committee alco  which is duly authorized by the board of directors to monitor our position and to make decisions relating to that process 
the alco s goal is to maximize net interest income while providing us with an acceptable level of market risk due to changes in interest rates 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in lending and deposit taking activities 
to that end  management actively monitors and manages our interest rate risk exposure 
profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact our earnings because the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
we monitor the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income using several tools 
one measure of our exposure to differential changes in interest rates between assets and liabilities is shown in the maturity and rate sensitivity analysis gap analysis 
another test measures the impact on net interest income and net portfolio value npv of an immediate change in interest rates in basis point increments 
npv is defined as the net present value of assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
following is the estimated impact of immediate changes in interest rates at the specified levels at december percentage change in change in interest rates net interest income net portfolio value in basis points the percentage change in this column represents net interest income for months in a stable interest rate environment versus the net interest income in the various rate scenarios 
the percentage change in this column represents our npv in a stable interest rate environment versus the npv in the various rate scenarios 
our primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and capital  while structuring our asset liability composition to obtain the maximum yield cost spread 
we rely primarily on our asset liability strategies to control interest rate risk 
the results of the interest rate shock are within the limits set by the board of directors 
we continually evaluate interest rate risk management opportunities  including the possible use of derivative financial instruments 
at december   we had not entered into any derivative contracts or hedging instruments 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments  and deposits decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the alco could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of net interest income and npv 
actual values may differ from those projections presented in cases where market conditions vary from assumptions used in the calculation of net interest income and the npv 
liquidity risk liquidity management is the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs 
core deposits are a major source of funds used to meet cash flow needs 
maintaining the ability to acquire these funds as needed in a variety of money markets is the key to assuring liquidity 
approximately of our time deposits are composed of accounts with balances less than when evaluating the movement of these funds  even during large interest rate changes  it is apparent that we continue to attract deposits that can be used to meet cash flow needs 
another source available for meeting our liquidity needs is available for sale securities 
the available for sale portfolio is composed of securities with a readily available market that can be converted to cash if the need arises 
during  the most significant purchase of investment securities was in the mortgage backed sector 
these securities provide a monthly cash flow of both principal and interest 
we used this structure in order to provide liquidity to fund future loan growth as the economy improves 
in addition  we maintain a federal funds position that provides day to day funds to meet liquidity needs and may also obtain advances from the federal home loan bank or the treasury tax and loan note account in order to meet liquidity needs 
repayments and maturities of loans provide substantial sources of liquidity 
approximately of our loans mature or reprice within the next twelve months 
capital resources total shareholders equity of the company was  and  at december  and  respectively 
shareholders equity increased during  and during the growth in capital for both years was attributable to earnings and unrealized securities gains  less dividends declared and treasury shares purchased

during  we purchased approximately  shares of stock and issued approximately  shares in an acquisition 
in addition  the change in the net unrealized gain loss on securities available for sale increased capital in by  and in by  shareholders equity as a percentage of assets was and at december  and  respectively 
the federal reserve board  the fdic  and the occ have issued guidelines for governing the levels of capital that banks are to maintain 
those guidelines specify capital tiers  which include the following classifications tier risk total risk leverage capital tiers based capital based capital ratio well capitalized or above or above or above adequately capitalized or above or above or above undercapitalized less than less than less than significantly undercapitalized less than less than less than critically undercapitalized or less tier leverage ratios were and at december  and  respectively  meeting the guidelines for a well capitalized company
